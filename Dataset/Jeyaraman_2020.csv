The graft tissue characteristics and subchondral bone were examined by qualitative histology, ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) II scoring and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific to type I and type II collagen.A total of 31 biopsies were available, 10 undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 21 patients undergoing revision surgery. Patients in the clinically failed group were significantly older (46.3 years) than patients in the revision group (36.6 years) (P = 0.007). Histologically, the predominant tissue in both groups was of fibrocartilaginous nature, although a higher percentage of specimens in the revision group contained a hyaline-like repair tissue. The percentages of type I collagen (52.9% and 61.0%) and type II collagen (66.3% and 42.2%) were not significantly different between clinically failed and revised MACI, respectively. The talar dome contained the best and patella the worst repair tissue. Subchondral bone pathology was present in all clinically failed patients and consisted of bone marrow lesions, including edema, necrosis and fibrosis, intralesional osteophyte formation, subchondral bone plate elevation, intralesional osteophyte formation, subchondral bone cyst formation, or combinations thereof.MACI grafts in patients with revision and total joint arthroplasty were predominantly fibrocartilage in repair type, did not differ in composition and were histologically dissimilar to healthy cartilage. Clinically failed cases showed evidence of osteochondral unit failure, rather than merely cartilage repair tissue failure. The role of the subchondral bone in relation to pain and failure and the pathogenesis warrants further investigation.",0

Among all the biofabrication approaches, bioprinting based on inkjet printing technology has the promises to deliver and create biomimicked tissue with high throughput, digital control, and the capacity of single cell manipulation. Therefore, this enabling technology has great potential in regenerative medicine and translational applications. The most current advances in organ and tissue bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in this review, including vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In addition, the benign side effect of bioprinting to the printed mammalian cells can be utilized for gene or drug delivery, which can be achieved conveniently during precise cell placement for tissue construction. With layer-by-layer assembly, three-dimensional tissues with complex structures can be printed using converted medical images. Therefore, bioprinting based on thermal inkjet is so far the most optimal solution to engineer vascular system to the thick and complex tissues. Collectively, bioprinting has great potential and broad applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The future advances of bioprinting include the integration of different printing mechanisms to engineer biphasic or triphasic tissues with optimized scaffolds and further understanding of stem cell biology.",0

Despite increasing interest in these MSCs, concerns regarding their safety, in vivo behavior and clinical effectiveness have restrained their clinical application. We hypothesized that MSCs have trophic effects that stimulate recycled chondrons (chondrocytes with their native pericellular matrix) to regenerate cartilage. Searching for a proof of principle, this phase I (first-in-man) clinical trial applied allogeneic MSCs mixed with either 10% or 20% recycled autologous cartilage-derived cells (chondrons) for treatment of cartilage defects in the knee in symptomatic cartilage defect patients. This unique first in man series demonstrated no treatment-related adverse events up to one year postoperatively. At 12 months, all patients showed statistically significant improvement in clinical outcome compared to baseline. Magnetic resonance imaging and second-look arthroscopies showed completely filled defects with regenerative cartilage tissue. Histological analysis on biopsies of the grafts indicated hyaline-like regeneration with a high concentration of proteoglycans and type II collagen. Short tandem repeat analysis showed the regenerative tissue only contained patient-own DNA. These findings support the novel insight that the use of allogeneic MSCs is safe and opens opportunities for other applications. Stem cell-induced paracrine mechanisms may play an important role in the chondrogenesis and successful tissue regeneration found.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/jisakos-2019-000380,Surgical treatment of complex meniscus tear and disease: state of the art,"The meniscus is important for load distribution, shock absorption and stability of the knee joint. Meniscus injury or meniscectomy results in decreased function of the meniscus and increased risk of knee osteoarthritis. To preserve the meniscal functions, meniscal repair should be considered as the first option for meniscus injury. Although reoperation rates are higher after meniscal repair compared with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, long-term follow-up of meniscal repair demonstrated better clinical outcomes and less severe degenerative changes of osteoarthritis compared with partial meniscectomy. In the past, the indication of a meniscal repair was limited both because of technical reasons and due to the localised vascularity of the meniscus. Meanwhile, it spreads today as the development of the concept to preserve the meniscus and the improvement of meniscal repair techniques. Longitudinal vertical tears in the peripheral third are considered the ‘gold standard' indication in terms of meniscus healing. Techniques for meniscal repair include ‘inside-out', ‘outside-in' and ‘all-inside' strategies. Surgical decision-making depends on the type, size and location of the meniscus injury. Meniscal root tears substantially affect meniscal hoop function and accelerate cartilage degeneration; therefore, meniscus root repair is necessary to prevent the progression of osteoarthritis change. For symptomatic meniscus defects after meniscectomy, transplantation of allograft or collagen meniscus implant may be indicated, and acceptable clinical results have been obtained. Recently, meniscus extrusion has attracted attention due to increased interest in early osteoarthritis. The centralisation techniques have been proposed to reduce the meniscus extrusion by suturing the meniscus-capsule complex to the edge of the tibial plateau. Long-term clinical outcomes of this procedure may change the strategy of treating meniscus extrusion. When malalignment of the lower leg is accompanied with meniscus pathologies, knee osteotomies are a reasonable option to protect the repaired meniscus by unloading the pathological compartment. Advancements in biological augmentation such as bone marrow stimulation, fibrin clot, platelet-rich plasma, stem cell therapy and scaffolds have also expanded the indications for meniscus surgery. In summary, improved repair techniques and biological augmentation have made meniscus repair more appealing to treat that had previously been considered irreparable. However, further research would be necessary to validate the efficacy of these specialised technique.",0

For this purpose suitable biocompatible scaffolds are needed to provide cell retention, chondrogenesis and initial mechanical stability. The present study should indicate whether a recently developed highly porous alginate (Alg) foam scaffold supplemented with chondroitin sulfate (CS) allows the attachment, survival and chondrogenesis of BM-MSCs and articular chondrocytes. The foams were prepared using a freeze-drying method; some of them were supplemented with CS and subsequently characterized for porosity, biodegradation and mechanical profile. BM-MSCs were cultured for 1-2 weeks on the scaffold either under chondrogenic or maintenance conditions. Cell vitality assays, histology, glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) assay, and type II and I collagen immunolabelings were performed to monitor cell growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in the scaffolds. Scaffolds had a high porosity ~93-95% with a mean pore sizes of 237±48 μm (Alg) and 197±61 μm (Alg/CS). Incorporation of CS increased mechanical strength of the foams providing gradually CS release over 7 days. Most of the cells survived in the scaffolds. BM-MSCs and articular chondrocytes formed rounded clusters within the scaffold pores. The BM-MSCs, irrespective of whether cultured under non/chondrogenic conditions and chondrocytes produced an ECM containing sGAGs, and types II and I collagen. Total collagen and sGAG contents were higher in differentiated BM-MSC cultures supplemented with CS than in CS-free foams after 14 days. The cell cluster formation induced by the scaffolds might stimulate chondrogenesis via initial intense cell-cell contacts.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-016-1051-6,Weekly injections of Hylan G-F 20 delay cartilage degeneration in partial meniscectomized rat knees,"Cross-linked hyaluronan--also called Hylan G-F 20--is a medical device developed to treat osteoarthritis of the knee. However, it is still controversial whether Hylan G-F 20 has a cartilage protective effect in trauma-induced osteoarthritis. We investigated whether Hylan G-F 20 delayed osteoarthritis progression in a partial meniscectomized rat model.Lewis rats were used for the experiments. The anterior medial meniscus was resected at the level of the medial collateral ligament in both knees. From 1 week after the surgery, 50 μl of Hylan G-F 20 was injected weekly into the left knee and phosphate buffered saline was injected into the right knee. Cartilage was evaluated for macroscopic findings, histology with safranin-o, and expression of type II collagen at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Synovitis was also evaluated, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed for ED1.Macroscopic findings demonstrated that India ink positive area, representing fibrillated cartilage, was significantly smaller in the Hylan G-F 20 group than in the control group at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (n = 5). There were no significant differences in osteophyte score between the Hylan G-F 20 group and the control group at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Histologically, the cartilage in the medial tibial plateau was destroyed at 8 weeks in the control group, while type II collagen expression was still observed at 8 weeks in the Hylan G-F 20 group. OARSI score for cartilage histology was significantly lower in the Hylan G-F 20 group than in the control group at 4 and 8 weeks (n = 5). There were no significant differences in synovial cell number or modified synovitis score between the Hylan G-F 20 group and the control group at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (n = 5). In the Hylan G-F 20 group, foreign bodies surrounded by ED1 positive macrophages were observed in the synovium.Weekly injections of Hylan G-F 20 starting 1 week after surgery delayed cartilage degeneration after meniscectomy in a rat model. Synovitis induced by meniscectomy was not alleviated by Hylan G-F 20. Insoluble gels were observed in the synovium after the Hylan G-F 20 injection.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.m.01041,Weight-Bearing Compared with Non-Weight-Bearing Following Osteochondral Autograft Transfer for Small Defects in Weight-Bearing Areas in the Femoral Articular Cartilage of the Knee,"Patients are routinely kept non-weight-bearing for four to eight weeks following osteochondral autograft transfer to repair cartilage defects of the medial and/or lateral femoral condyle. Therefore, the objective of this novel study was to investigate whether postoperative weight-bearing restrictions affect the outcomes of cartilage repair when an osteochondral autograft transfer system is used to repair small defects in weight-bearing areas of femoral articular cartilage.This a retrospective comparative study. Following review of the charts on 567 consecutive arthroscopic osteochondral autograft transfers, three homogeneous groups of patients with consecutive cases were identified: group A, cases of patients who were non-weight-bearing following the procedure (n = 68); group B, cases of those who were non-weight-bearing following the procedure with concomitant anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (n = 29); and group C, cases of those who were weight-bearing as tolerated following the procedure (n = 437). The cases of patients whose knees underwent second-look (repeat) arthroscopy were stratified into two subgroups: non-weight-bearing (n = 20) and weight-bearing as tolerated (n = 42). Graft position and manifestation of a repair-adjacent defect (Outerbridge grade-III or IV cartilage defect that develops adjacent to the original osteochondral autograft transfer repair) were assessed during second-look arthroscopy. Cartilage repair was retrospectively assessed from second-look arthroscopy pictures by a blinded, independent orthopaedic surgeon with use of the International Cartilage Repair Society macroscopic cartilage-repair assessment tool. Postoperative complication rates were compared among the three primary groups.The mean grafted area was 0.72 cm(2) (range, 0.16 to 1.45 cm(2)) and 0.73 cm(2) (range, 0.16 to 1.80 cm(2)) for the non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing-as-tolerated second-look subgroups, respectively. The mean International Cartilage Repair Society score was 11.12 and 11.25 points (near-normal cartilage) for the non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing-as-tolerated subgroups (p = 0.71) at a mean follow-up of 42.7 and 33.0 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in the duration of follow-up (p = 0.58), repair-adjacent defect prevalence (p = 0.94), or graft position (p = 0.99) between the two subgroups. Weight-bearing-as-tolerated patients (group C) experienced significantly fewer deep vein thrombosis and arthrofibrosis complications compared with non-weight-bearing patients (groups A and B) (p < 0.001).Postoperative weight-bearing restrictions did not affect mid-term cartilage repair outcomes in patients who underwent second-look arthroscopy when an osteochondral autograft transfer system was used to repair small defects in weight-bearing areas of cartilage of the medial and/or lateral femoral condyle.Therapeutic Level III.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546519868213,Increased Chondrocytic Gene Expression Is Associated With Improved Repair Tissue Quality and Graft Survival in Patients After Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Assays to quantitate the quality of autologous chondrocyte implants have recently become available. However, the correlation of the assay score with radiological and clinical outcomes has not been established. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to assess the influence of cell identity (chondrocyte/synoviocyte gene expression ratio) and viability on patient-reported outcome measures, graft survival, and repair tissue quality. It was hypothesized that greater cell product quality as assessed through an identity assay and cell viability is associated with superior outcomes after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for symptomatic cartilage defects. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Seventy-nine patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were included in this study. Of these, 67 patients were available for imaging assessment utilizing the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring system. Patients were assigned to groups either below or above the cohort’s mean based on their individual cell identity score and viability percentage. Results: Patients were predominantly female (57.7%) with a mean age of 30.0 ± 9.3 years. No differences were seen between Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm, Tegner, or International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form within the viability and cell identity groups at a final follow-up of 3.8 ± 1.4 years after ACI ( P &gt; .05). In a subset of patients, the mean MOCART score was 68.3 ± 15.6 at an average magnetic resonance imaging follow-up of 17.7 ± 9.56 months. Low cell identity was significantly associated with the degree of defect filling ( P = .025), integration of border zone ( P = .01), effusion ( P = .024), and ACI graft failure ( P = .002). Patients with above-average cell identity scores had a significantly higher survival rate at 5-year follow-up compared with patients with below-average scores (95.8% vs 64.7%; P = .013). Cell viability did not influence MOCART subscales or graft failure (all P &gt; .05). Cell viability and identity showed no significant correlation with each other ( r = −0.045; P = .694). Conclusion: Cell identity was significantly correlated with structural repair quality and graft survival after second-generation ACI for symptomatic chondral lesions in the knee. While improved imaging outcome and higher graft survivorship were associated with a higher individual cell identity score indicating a higher chondrocyte/synoviocyte gene expression ratio in the final cell product, clinical outcome did not correlate with the identity score.",0
https://doi.org/10.1258/ar.2010.100087,Periosteal autograft for articular cartilage defects in dogs: MR imaging and ultrasonography of the repair process,"Background Autologous periosteal grafting is used as treatment for cartilage defects. Purpose To assess the role of MR imaging and ultrasonography in the evaluation of the post-graft repair process with imaging and histologic correlation. Material and Methods Periosteal grafts obtained from the tibia of eight dogs were transplanted to the experimental cartilage defects in the femoral condyles (15 knees). The control group was comprised of three dogs (five knees). MR imaging using 4.7T and ultrasonography of the grafted specimens was performed at one, two, four, eight, and 16 weeks after transplantation. The animals were sacrificed at the time of imaging at the previously specified intervals. Histologic analysis with imaging correlation was subsequently performed. Results All specimens taken from one to 16 weeks demonstrated periosteal proliferation in the graft. At one week, experimental cartilage defects were no longer present on MR imaging. Area of high signal intensity (SI) in the defect was present which corresponded to hemorrhage, edema, and fibrosis on histology. At two, four, and eight weeks, all but two graft demonstrated heterogeneous high SI on T2-weighted image, consistent with immature cartilage. At 16 weeks, all grafts showed heterogeneous isointense to adjacent cartilage on all sequences, which corresponded to dominant mature cartilage. The repair tissue near the exposed subchondral bone revealed heterogeneous high SI on T2-weighted images. This corresponded to the fibrosis with vascular penetration and edema. In the control group, no cartilage repair was noted within cartilage defects. The serial MR features of the grafted area correlated well with the histologic findings. Serial sonographic findings were not sufficient to provide the regenerated cartilage maturity. Conclusion MR imaging is capable of depicting the repair characteristics following periosteal grafting for articular cartilage defects. MR imaging may provide useful information in the assessment of the graft appearance with definite implications regarding the degree and success of incorporation.",0

Their fate and distribution were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and macroscopic and histologic postmortem examination. Osteoarthritis was induced in 12 sheep by bilateral meniscectomy. After 6 weeks, one knee joint received 10 × 10 6 SPIO-labeled MSCs (Molday Ion Rhodamine B). Contralateral knees received a control injection of a) PBS, b) SPIO in PBS, c) 10 × 10 6 nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs in PBS, or d) no injection. MR images were acquired immediately after injection and 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks thereafter using a 0.5-T unit and a T2* sequence. Signal intensity of synovial fluid and synovial lining was assessed semiquantitatively using a scoring system. Viable SPIO-labeled MSCs produced a strong hypointense signal in the synovial fluid immediately after injection, but normal signal intensity of the synovial fluid was observed 1 week later. Synovial lining maintained its hypointensity throughout the study period. Nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs induced hypointense signals of the synovial fluid; synovial lining appeared weak and inconsistently hypointense in the following weeks. Pure SPIO produced a strong hyperintense signal in the synovial fluid at the time of injection only. Histologically, in all knee joints receiving viable SPIO-labeled MSCs, SPIO particles were detected (Prussian blue) within the synovial lining, dorsal fat pad, and neomeniscus tissue, but not in osteochondral samples. Few SPIO particles were detected in joints injected with nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs. Immunohistologically, no increased cell death (TUNEL) was observed in the area of detected SPIO particles, but we did observe potential chondrogenic cell differentiation (Safranin O or S100β). We conclude that viable SPIO-labeled MSCs remain detectable within the joint for 12 weeks and attach themselves to some but not all diseased joint structures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.04.002,Second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplantation: MRI findings and clinical correlations at a minimum 5-year follow-up,"To evaluate the clinical outcome of hyaluronan-based arthroscopic autologous chondrocyte transplantation at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up and to correlate it with the MRI evaluation parameters.Fifty consecutive patients were included in the study and evaluated clinically using the Cartilage Standard Evaluation Form as proposed by ICRS and the Tegner score. Forty lesions underwent MRI evaluation at a minimum 5-year follow-up. For the description and evaluation of the graft, we employed the MOCART-scoring system.A statistically significant improvement in all clinical scores was observed at 2 and over 5 years. The total MOCART score and the signal intensity (3D-GE-FS) of the repair tissue were statistically correlated to the IKDC subjective evaluation. Larger size of the treated cartilage lesions had a negative influence on the degree of defect repair and filling, the integration to the border zone and the subchondral lamina integrity, whereas more intensive sport activity had a positive influence on the signal intensity of the repair tissue, the repair tissue surface, and the clinical outcome.Our findings confirm the durability of the clinical results obtained with Hyalograft C and the usefulness of MRI as a non-invasive method for the evaluation of the repaired tissue and the outcome after second-generation autologous transplantation over time.",0
,"Increased knee cartilage volume in degenerative joint disease using percutaneously implanted, autologous mesenchymal stem cells, platelet lysate and dexamethasone","Background: The purpose of this study was to see if percutaneously injected autologous mesenchymal stem cells, platelet lysate, and dexamethasone could reduce this patient's knee cartilage defect size. Case Report: A study patient's mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from her iliac crest bone marrow, isolated and expanded in culture. They were then injected into her knee along with autologous platelet lysate to enhance growth, and nanogram doses of dexamethasone to promote differentiation to chondrocytes. Pre and post treatment MRI imaging, physical therapy and pain score data were then analyzed. Conclusions: This patient's MRI data showed a significant decrease in cartilage defect size. Along with this, her measured physical therapy outcomes and subjective pain and functional status all improved. Autologous mesenchymal stem cell injection, in conjunction with platelet lysate and low-dose dexamethasone are a promising minimally invasive therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee.",0
https://doi.org/10.22203/ecm.v020a23,Reticulated vitreous carbon: a useful material for cell adhesion and tissue invasion,"Diverse carbon materials have been used for tissue engineering and clinical implant applications with varying success. In this study, commercially available reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foams were tested in vitro and in vivo for compatibility with primary cell adhesion and tissue repair. Pores sizes were determined as 279 ± 98 μm. No hydroxyapatite deposition was detected after immersion of the foams in simulated body fluid. Nonetheless, RVC provided an excellent support for adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well as primary chondrocytes without any surface pre-treatment. Live cell quantification revealed neutral behaviour of the material with plastic adhered chondrocytes but moderate cytotoxicity with MSCs. Yet, rabbit implanted foams exhibited good integration in subcutaneous pockets and most importantly, total defect repair in bone. Probably due to the stiffness of the material, incompatibility with cartilage regeneration was found. Interestingly and in contrast to several other carbon materials, we observed a total lack of foreign body reactions. Our results and its outstanding porous interconnectivity and availability within a wide range of pore sizes convert RVC into an attractive candidate for tissue engineering applications in a variety of bone models and for ex vivo cell expansion for regenerative medical applications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2021.08.038,Particulated Juvenile Articular Cartilage and Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation Are Cost-Effective for Patellar Chondral Lesions,"To compare the cost-effectiveness of nonoperative management, particulated juvenile allograft cartilage (PJAC), and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) in the management of patellar chondral lesions.A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three strategies for symptomatic patellar chondral lesions: 1) nonoperative management, 2) PJAC, and 3) MACI. Model inputs (transition probabilities, utilities, and costs) were derived from literature review and an institutional cohort of 67 patients treated with PJAC for patellar chondral defects (mean age 26 years, mean lesion size 2.7 cm2). Societal and payer perspectives over a 15-year time horizon were evaluated. The principal outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using a $100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model and the relative effects of variable estimates on base case conclusions.From a societal perspective, nonoperative management, PJAC, and MACI cost $4,140, $52,683, and $83,073 and were associated with 5.28, 7.22, and 6.92 QALYs gained, respectively. PJAC and MACI were cost-effective relative to nonoperative management (ICERs $25,010/QALY and $48,344/QALY, respectively). PJAC dominated MACI in the base case analysis by being cheaper and more effective, but this was sensitive to the estimated effectiveness of both strategies. PJAC remained cost-effective if PJAC and MACI were considered equally effective.In the management of symptomatic patellar cartilage defects, PJAC and MACI were both cost-effective compared to nonoperative management. Because of the need for one surgery instead of two, and less costly graft material, PJAC was cheaper than MACI. Consequently, when PJAC and MACI were considered equally effective, PJAC was more cost-effective than MACI. Sensitivity analyses accounting for the lack of robust long-term data for PJAC or MACI demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of PJAC versus MACI depended heavily on the relative probabilities of yielding similar clinical results.III, economic and decision analysis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-016-2438-z,Delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage and T2 mapping for evaluation of reparative cartilage-like tissue after autologous chondrocyte implantation associated with Atelocollagen-based scaffold in the knee,"To elucidate the quality of tissue-engineered cartilage after an autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) technique with Atelocollagen gel as a scaffold in the knee in the short- to midterm postoperatively, we assessed delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cartilage (dGEMRIC) and T2 mapping and clarified the relationship between T1 and T2 values and clinical results. In this cross-sectional study, T1 and T2 mapping were performed on 11 knees of 8 patients (mean age at ACI, 37.2 years) with a 3.0-T MRI scanner. T1(implant) and T2(implant) values were compared with those of the control cartilage region (T1(control) and T2(control)). Lysholm scores were also assessed for clinical evaluation. The relationships between the T1 and T2 values and the clinical Lysholm score were also assessed. There were no significant differences in the T1 values between the T1(implant) (386.64 +/- 101.78 ms) and T1(control) (375.82 +/- 62.89 ms) at the final follow-up. The implants showed significantly longer T2 values compared to the control cartilage (53.83 +/- 13.89 vs. 38.21 +/- 4.43 ms). The postoperative Lysholm scores were significantly higher than the preoperative scores. A significant correlation was observed between T1(implant) and clinical outcomes, but not between T2(implant) and clinical outcomes. Third-generation ACI implants might have obtained an almost equivalent glycosaminoglycan concentration compared to the normal cartilage, but they had lower collagen density at least 3 years after transplantation. The T1(implant) value, but not the T2 value, might be a predictor of clinical outcome after ACI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546515574063,Prospective Clinical and Radiologic Evaluation of Patellofemoral Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: While matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in the treatment of knee chondral defects, there remains little available research specifically investigating its use in the patellofemoral joint. Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcome of MACI in the patellofemoral joint. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: In 47 consecutive patients undergoing patellofemoral MACI, clinical (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, visual analog scale for pain, 6-minute walk test, knee range of motion, and strength assessment) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments were undertaken before and 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The MRI was performed to assess graft infill and determine an overall MRI composite score. Results were analyzed according to (1) the patient sample overall and (2) after stratification into 4 subgroups per implant location (patella or trochlea) as well as whether or not adjunct tibial tubercle transfer for patellofemoral malalignment was required. Results: The overall patient sample, as well as each of the 4 procedural subgroups, demonstrated clinically and statistically significant ( P &lt; .05) improvements over time for all clinical scores. Graft infill and the MRI composite score also demonstrated statistically significant ( P &lt; .05) improvements over time, with no evidence of a main effect for procedure group or interaction between procedure group and time. At 24 months after surgery, 40.4% (n = 19) of patients exhibited complete graft infill comparable with the adjacent native cartilage, with a further 6.4% (n = 3) demonstrating a hypertrophic graft. A further 31.9% (n = 15) of patients exhibited 50% to 100% tissue infill, and 17% (n = 8) demonstrated &lt;50% tissue infill. Two patients (4.3%) demonstrated graft failure. At 24 months after surgery, 85% (n = 40) of patients were satisfied with the results of their MACI surgery. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that MACI provides improved clinical and radiologic outcomes to 24 months in patients undergoing treatment specifically for articular cartilage defects on the patella or trochlea, with and without concurrent realignment of the extensor mechanism if required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546517745489,Morphologic Properties of Cartilage Lesions in the Knee Arthroscopically Prepared by the Standard Curette Technique Are Inferior to Lesions Prepared by Specialized Chondrectomy Instruments,"Background: Cartilage lesion preparation is an important component to cartilage repair procedures, given the effect of prepared lesion morphology on the formation of durable and well-integrated repair tissue. Purpose: To compare the quality of arthroscopic cartilage lesion debridement performed by (1) the standard curette (SC) technique and (2) specialized chondrectomy (CM) instruments, to provide technical guidance for optimization of cartilage lesion preparation in the setting of arthroscopic cartilage repair. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Articular cartilage lesions of standardized size (8 × 15 mm) were demarcated within the trochlea and femoral condyles of 20 human cadaver knee specimens. Orthopaedic surgeons performed arthroscopic lesion preparation using 2 techniques that consisted of SC preparation and preparation by CM instruments. A histologic comparative analysis was performed within each treatment group and between treatment groups to evaluate the morphology of prepared cartilage defects. Results: The mean angle deviation from perpendicular of the cartilage wall at the front of the prepared cartilage lesions was significantly greater in the SC group versus the CM group (29.8° ± 21.4° vs 7.7° ± 7.6°, P &lt; .001). In lesions prepared via the SC technique, the cartilage walls at the front of the prepared lesions were significantly less perpendicular than the cartilage walls at the rear of the lesions (29.8° ± 21.4° vs 11.0° ± 10.3°, P &lt; .001), whereas lesions prepared by the CM technique demonstrated comparable verticality of surrounding cartilage walls at the front and rear aspects of the lesions (7.7° ± 7.6° vs 9.4° ± 12.3°, P = .827). Depth of lesion debridement was accomplished to the target level by the CM technique in 86% of prepared lesions, compared with 34% of lesions in the SC group. The prepared cartilage wall profile was characterized as the most ideal morphology in 55% of prepared lesions in the CM group, as opposed to 10% in the SC group. Conclusion: Arthroscopic cartilage lesion preparation with SC instruments results in superior perpendicularity of surrounding cartilage walls to subchondral bone and greater consistency of debrided lesion depth, as compared with the standard debridement technique with curettes. Clinical Relevance: Arthroscopic preparation using standard curette technique leads to suboptimal morphologic characteristics of prepared lesions that likely affect the quality of repair tissue, compared to preparation using specialized chondrectomy instruments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2005.07.024,Preparation of a biphasic scaffold for osteochondral tissue engineering,"Abstract Tissue engineering has been developed as a prospective approach for the repair of articular cartilage defects. Engineered osteochondral implants can facilitate the fixation and integration with host tissue, and therefore promote the regeneration of osteochondral defects. A biphasic scaffold with a stratified two-layer structure for osteochondral tissue engineering was developed from biodegradable synthetic and naturally derived polymers. The upper layer of the scaffold for cartilage engineering was collagen sponge; the lower layer for bone engineering was a composite sponge of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and naturally derived collagen. The PLGA–collagen composite sponge layer had a composite structure with collagen microsponge formed in the pores of a skeleton PLGA sponge. The collagen sponge in the two respective layers was connected. Observation of the collagen/PLGA–collagen biphasic scaffold by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated the connected stratified structure. The biphasic scaffold was used for culture of canine bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The cell/scaffold construct was implanted in an osteochondral defect in the knee of a one-year old beagle. Osteochondral tissue was regenerated four months after implantation. Cartilage- and bone-like tissues were formed in the respective layers. The collagen/PLGA–collagen biphasic scaffold will be useful for osteochondral tissue engineering.",0

Meniscal transplantation was performed using bone-in-slot techniques. Distal femoral and high tibial osteotomies were performed for valgus and varus malalignment, respectively. Microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and osteochondral autograft or allograft were performed for articular cartilage disease. Validated patient-reported and surgeon-measured outcomes were collected. Preoperative and postoperative outcomes and medial versus lateral disease were compared using Student <i>t</i> tests. <h3>Results</h3> Eighteen participants (mean age, 34 ± 7.8 years; symptomatic patients, 7.4 ± 5.6 years; 2.4 ± 1.0 surgical procedures before study enrollment; mean follow-up, 6.5 ± 3.2 years) were analyzed. Two thirds of participants had medial compartment pathologic conditions and one third had lateral compartment pathologic processes. At final follow-up, there were statistically significant clinically meaningful improvements in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective classification, Lysholm score, and 4 Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscores. Postoperative 12-item short form (SF-12) physical and mental component scores were not significantly different from preoperative scores. The Kellgren-Lawrence classification grade was 1.5 ± 1.1 at 2.5 ± 3.0 years after surgery. There was a significantly higher preoperative SF-12 physical composite score (PCS) in participants with lateral compartment pathologic conditions (<i>v</i> medial compartment conditions) (<i>P</i> = .011). Although there were 13 reoperations in 10 patients (55.5% reoperation rate), only one patient was converted to knee arthroplasty (5.6%) and one to revision cartilage surgery and meniscal transplantation (5.6% revision rate). The most common complication was arthrofibrosis (16.7%). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in validated patient-reported clinical outcome scores at long-term follow-up were observed in 18 participants undergoing combined meniscal transplantation, osteotomy, and articular cartilage surgery. Although there was a low rate of cartilage or meniscal revision (or both) and total knee arthroplasty, there was a high rate of reoperation. There was no significant difference in outcomes between participants with medial versus lateral pathologic conditions. <h3>Level of Evidence</h3> Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0

Patients who had a joint line congruity angle of more than 2°, malalignment of the knee from femoral causes, a fixed flexion deformity, or age older than 55 years were excluded. All patients underwent HTO and microfracture. The cell-recipient group received intra-articular injection of cultured MSCs with hyaluronic acid 3 weeks after surgery, whereas the control group only received hyaluronic acid. The primary outcome measure was the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at intervals of 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were Tegner and Lysholm clinical scores and 1-year postoperative Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scores.The median age of the patients was 51 years, with a mean body mass index of 23.85. Both treatment arms achieved improvements in Tegner, Lysholm, and IKDC scores. After adjustment for age, baseline scores, and time of evaluation, the cell-recipient group showed significantly better scores. The effect of treatment showed an added improvement of 7.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04 to 12.26; P = .001) for IKDC scores, 7.61 (95% CI, 1.44 to 13.79; P = .016) for Lysholm scores, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.10 to 1.19; P = .021) for Tegner scores. Magnetic resonance imaging scans performed 1 year after surgical intervention showed significantly better MOCART scores for the cell-recipient group. The age-adjusted mean difference in MOCART score was 19.6 (95% CI, 10.5 to 28.6; P < .001).Intra-articular injection of cultured MSCs is effective in improving both short-term clinical and MOCART outcomes in patients undergoing HTO and microfracture for varus knees with cartilage defects.Level II, randomized controlled trial.",1

,"Microfracture: indications, technique, and results.","The so-called ""marrow stimulating"" technique of microfracture uses an awl to penetrate the subchondral bone in cartilage defects. Disruption of the subchondral bone induces fibrin clot formation in the area of the chondral defect. This clot contains pluripotent, marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which are able to differentiate into fibrochondrocytes, resulting in a fibrocartilage repair with varying amounts of type I, II, and III collagen content. Microfracture is a single-stage procedure that is ideally suited for small, well-contained, Outerbridge grade 3 to 4 cartilage lesions. Most clinical studies of the outcomes after microfracture in the knee show improvement in knee function in 70% to 90% of patients. The long-term results vary. Almost all studies report significant improvement in the first year after surgery; some report a decline in activity levels after 1 year, especially in elite athletes. Other studies have shown a continuation of good results for up to 7 years. Recent studies have shown that a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2) and incomplete fibrocartilage fill of a lesion as observed on MRI correlate with a poor outcome. The technical simplicity of the procedure, cost-effectiveness, and relatively low patient morbidity make microfracture an invaluable tool for the treatment of small full-thickness cartilage lesions. Microfracture is a good first-line procedure because it does not prevent the application of other cartilage repair procedures that may be needed in the future.",0

Methods: From January 2013 to February 2014, a prospective study was conducted on 16 patients (16 knees) who underwent fibrin–matrix ACI for International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 or 4 chondral lesions of the knee. The major lesion was in the medial femoral condyle in all patients. The mean age of the patients was 58.1 ± 6.2 (range 51–66) years, and the minimum follow-up period was 2 years. All patients had clinical and radiological evaluations at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. Twelve patients had second-look arthroscopies at 1 year after surgery, and implanted chondral biopsies were performed in 11 of these 12 patients for histological analysis. Results: Functional disability assessment scales for the knee significantly improved after fibrin–matrix ACI ( p &lt; 0.05). The visual analog scale score significantly decreased from 6.7 ± 1.2 to 2.0 ± 1.8 ( p &lt; 0.001). The mean modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue score was 83.8 ± 17.3 at 1 year after surgery and 74.0 ± 19.2 at 2 years after surgery. Repair of the tissue with hyaline cartilage was confirmed histologically. Conclusions: Satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes were obtained from gel-type fibrin–matrix ACI technique in older patients with a cartilage defect of the knee. Histological analysis confirmed that the new repaired tissue with hyaline cartilage filled the cartilage defect area. Therefore, fibrin–matrix ACI is believed to be an applicable treatment for older patients with chondral lesions of the knee. Level of evidence: Level IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1053/j.oto.2014.05.006,Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation: Surgical Technique and Outcomes,"Chondral defects of the knee are frequently encountered during arthroscopy. For symptomatic lesions, several surgical options exist. Determining the best surgical option for a patient can be challenging for the treating surgeon. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is an articular cartilage–restoring procedure that is commonly used to treat medium-to-large full-thickness cartilage lesions of the knee. It is a 2-stage procedure requiring cartilage biopsy, 4-6 weeks of in vitro chondrocyte expansion, followed by reimplantation. Short- and long-term outcome studies have been promising regarding patient satisfaction and durability. Realignment procedures, as indicated, have been shown to improve clinical outcome and longevity of the transplanted grafts. As newer generation techniques evolve, complications have been minimized.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/03946320110241s228,The Manangement of Knee Cartilage Defects with Modified Amic Technique: Preliminary Results,"Cartilage defects represent a common problem in orthopaedic practice. The knee is frequently involved and the medial femoral condyle is the most common localization. Predisposing factors are: traumas, inflammatory conditions and biomechanics alterations. Several surgical options are available once correct diagnosis is given and accurate patient evaluation has been performed. The aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate functional results of modified autologous matrix induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) technique in a population of patients affected by focal cartilage defects A population of 17 patients was enrolled in this study. 10 patients were male, mean age at the time of surgery was 39 years, right side was involved in 11 cases. All patients were evaluated with accurate physical exam and complete imaging study. At an average FU of 36 months, mean IKDC score and Lysholm score improved from 32 to 82 and from 38 to 74. 13 patients out of 17 (76.5%) were satisfied or extremely satisfied with their functional result. MRI control showed reduction of the defect area and subchondral oedema in 10 cases (58.8%). AMIC technique is a relatively new option in the treatment of full thickness cartilage lesions. It enhances the advantages of microfractures since the Chondrogide membrane protects and stabilizes the blood plug acting as a matrix for new cartilage formation. First reports on AMIC technique, show comparable results to autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) with the advantage of a single stage technique and no donor site morbidity. AMIC technique represents a new option in the treatment of full thickness cartilage defect. It is safe and reliable. Our data are in accordance with previously reported series in literature and confirm the good objective and subjective results of this procedure.",0

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a combined biomechanical and biological approach could offer good results in unicompartmental OA, thus delaying the need for unicompartmental arthroplasty in patients too young or refusing metal resurfacing. Forty-three patients (mean age = 40.1 +/- A 11 years, 33 men and 10 women, mean BMI = 25 +/- A 3) affected by unicompartmental OA (Kellegren-Lawrence score = 3) in stable joints were enrolled and treated consecutively. Fifteen patients were treated with osteotomy and osteochondral biomimetic scaffold implant (3 of them also with meniscal substitution), 11 with osteotomy and meniscal scaffold implant, 9 with osteotomy and meniscal allograft implant, and 8 with both cartilage and meniscal reconstruction, depending on the specific joint compartment main requirements. Clinical evaluation was performed at 3-year (2-4) median follow-up using the following scoring systems: IKDC subjective and objective, VAS for pain, and Tegner scores. Failures, adverse events, and complications were also reported. The IKDC subjective score improved from 47.3 to 79.6 at the final evaluation (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), VAS improved from 6.1 to 2.3 (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), and also sport activity level evaluated with the Tegner score showed a significant improvement, from 2 (1-5) to 4 (3-10; p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), even if without achieving the pre-injury level (6, p = 0.001). A further subanalysis confirmed the positive outcome obtained in all the treatment subgroups and showed a higher clinical improvement in patients under the age of 40 years (IKDC subjective 84.4 +/- A 13.2 vs 76.5 +/- A 17.3; p = 0.03). This integrated biological and biomechanical approach produced a marked improvement at short-medium follow-up in patients affected by unicompartmental OA. Even though a good outcome was achieved at all ages, patients under the age of 40 years presented a greater clinical and subjective improvement. Longer follow-up studies are needed to show results over time and confirm this approach as an effective alternative to unicompartmental implants. Case series, Level IV.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.35373,Composite scaffolds composed of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular matrix and marrow clots promote marrow cell retention and proliferation,"Various biomaterials have been investigated in attempts to improve the mechanical stability of marrow clots derived from microfracture to obtain repaired tissue closely resembling hyaline cartilage. The goal of this study was to investigate the retention, adhesion, proliferation, and cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) production of marrow clot-derived cells within a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived (BMSC-d) ECM/marrow clot composite scaffold. We fabricated BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffolds and kept them in chondrogenic medium in vitro for 1, 3, or 6 weeks. Unmodified marrow clots were used as a control. The BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold exhibited a porous structure suitable for cell attachment and growth and further maintained cell viability. The DNA content measurements revealed that more cells proliferated in the BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffolds over time than in the marrow clots. Furthermore, the histologic, immunohistochemical, and western blot results demonstrated that the BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold produced more hyaline-like cartilage and less fibrocartilage than the marrow clot in culture. Taken together, these findings indicate that the porous BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold promotes the retention, attachment, and proliferation of cells from the marrow clot, and thus can stabilize the marrow clot to support chondrogenesis. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516631739,Autologous Bone Plug Supplemented With Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in Osteochondral Defects of the Knee,"Background: Structural and functional outcome of bone graft with first- or second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in treating cartilage and subchondral bone defect has not been reported previously. Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of simultaneous transplantation of an autologous bone plug with first- or second-generation ACI for restoration of concomitant subchondral bone and full-thickness cartilage defect in the femoral condyle of the knee. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Seventeen patients (mean ± SD age, 27 ± 7 years; range, 17-40 years)—12 with osteochondritis dissecans (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grades 3 and 4) and 5 with an isolated osteochondral defect (ICRS grade 4)—had the defect reconstructed with implantation of a unicortical autologous bone graft combined with ACI (the OsPlug technique). Functional outcome was assessed with Lysholm scores obtained preoperatively and at 1 and 5 years postoperatively. The repair site was evaluated with the Oswestry Arthroscopy Score (OAS), MOCART score (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue), and ICRS II histology score. Formation of a subchondral lamina and lateral integration of the bone grafts were evaluated from magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: The mean defect size was 4.5 ± 2.6 cm 2 (range, 1-9 cm 2 ), and the mean depth was 11.3 ± 5 mm (range, 5-18 mm). The preoperative Lysholm score improved from 45 (interquartile range [IQR], 24; range, 16-79) to 77 (IQR, 28; range, 41-100) at 1 year ( P = .001) and 70 (IQR, 35; range, 33-91) at 5 years ( P = .009). The mean OAS of the repair site was 6.2 (range, 0-9) at a mean of 1.3 years. The mean MOCART score was 61 ± 22 (range, 20-85) at 2.6 ± 1.8 years. Histology demonstrated generally good integration of the repair cartilage with the underlying bone. Poor lateral integration of the bone graft, as assessed on magnetic resonance imaging scan, and a low OAS were significantly associated with a poor Lysholm score and failure. A total of 3 patients had treatment failure, with 1 requiring total knee replacement at 5 years (Lysholm score of 33 at failure) and the other 2 requiring further surgical intervention because of persistent symptoms at 2 and 4 years, respectively (both had Lysholm score of 45 at failure). The Lysholm score in these patients before failure were still noted to be higher than at the preoperative level. Conclusion: The OsPlug technique shows significant improvement of functional outcome for up to 5 years in patients with high-grade osteochondritis dissecans or osteochondral defect. This is the first report describing association of bone graft integration with functional outcome after such a procedure. It also demonstrates histologic evidence of integration of the repair cartilage with the underlying bone graft.",0

Aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and MRI outcome after the implantation of a nanostructured biomimetic three-phasic collagen-hydroxyapatite construct for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects of the knee in a large cohort of patients. Seventy-nine patients (63 M, 16 W), affected by grade III-IV femoral condyle or trochlea chondral lesions or osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) were consecutively treated. Mean age was 31.0 +/- A 11.3 years, mean lesion size was 3.2 +/- A 2.0 cm(2). Fifty patients underwent previous surgeries, concurrent procedures were necessary in 39 cases. The clinical outcome was evaluated using the IKDC and Tegner scores at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. At follow-up times an MRI was performed and evaluated with the MOCART score. All the scores improved significantly from the baseline. IKDC subjective score showed a further increase between 12 and 24 months of follow-up, and 82.2 % of the patients improved their symptoms at the final evaluation. Patients affected by OCDs had better results than those with degenerative lesions. Some abnormal MRI findings were present, even though no correlation was found with the clinical outcome. This one-step biomimetic approach developed to favor osteochondral tissue regeneration is effective in treating knees affected by damages of the articular surface, leading to a significant clinical improvement. However, abnormal MRI findings were present, even if not correlated with the clinical outcome.",0

The OCD lesion was debrided and OATS(™) instrumentation used for resurfacing the defect with osteochondral core grafts collected from the stifle. Recipient sockets were created to maximally resurface articular lesions. Outcomes measures included clinical, radiographic, and arthroscopic examination at 12-18 weeks and clinical examination at 12-46 months (mean, 30.8 months) postoperatively.Resurfacing of the humeral head was achieved in all dogs. Subjectively, lameness resolved in 9 of 16 limbs by 5-6 weeks postoperatively, and in 13 limbs by 12-18 weeks. Radiographically, all autografts were maintained. On second-look arthroscopy, the grafted section was intact, resilient on probing, satisfactorily conformed to the adjacent articular contour, and grossly appeared consistent with hyaline or fibrocartilage depending on the graft source. Of 12 limbs available for 12-46 months reevaluation, none were considered lame and mild discomfort on shoulder manipulation was recorded for only 1 joint.OAT procedures are technically feasible in the caudocentral aspect of the canine humeral head.

Patients were randomized and treated with either MF or m-BMS with Chondrotissue. Defect filling, as assessed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), at postoperative 12 weeks was defined as the primary outcome measure, with follow-up MRI at weeks 54 and 108. Follow-up data were also collected at 12, 54, and 108 weeks after surgery and included patient-reported clinical scores: visual analog scale for pain, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee score, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey.MRI scans confirmed cartilage repair tissue formation in both groups 12 weeks after treatment. There was no significant difference between the m-BMS and MF groups in the percentage of defect filling at 12, 54, and 108 weeks postoperatively. No significant difference was found in terms of patient-reported clinical scores. Both groups showed significant improvement in 4 KOOS subscales-Pain, Activities of Daily Living, Sport and Recreation, and Quality of Life-at 54 and 108 weeks after treatment.This is the first randomized controlled trial comparing m-BMS with a polyglycolic acid matrix with hyaluronan with MF. The use of the Chondrotissue implant in m-BMS has been proven to be a safe procedure.

https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202103525,Directed Regeneration of Osteochondral Tissue by Hierarchical Assembly of Spatially Organized Composite Spheroids,"The use of engineered scaffolds or stem cells is investigated widely in the repair of injured musculoskeletal tissue. However, the combined regeneration of hierarchical osteochondral tissue remains a challenge due to delamination between cartilage and subchondral bone or difficulty in spatial control over differentiation of transplanted stem cells. Here, two types of composite spheroids are prepared using adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and nanofibers coated with either transforming growth factor-β3 or bone morphogenetic growth factor-2 for chondrogenesis or osteogenesis, respectively. Each type of spheroid is then cultured within a 3D-printed microchamber in a spatially arranged manner to recapitulate the bilayer structure of osteochondral tissue. The presence of inductive factors regionally modulates in vitro chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs within the biphasic construct without dedifferentiation. Furthermore, hADSCs from each spheroid proliferate and sprout and successfully connect the two layers mimicking the osteochondral interface without apertures. In vivo transplantation of the biphasic construct onto a femoral trochlear groove defect in rabbit knee joint results in 21.2 ± 2.8% subchondral bone volume/total volume and a cartilage score of 25.0 ± 3.7. The present approach can be an effective therapeutic platform to engineer complex tissue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2022.02.004,The transplantation of particulated juvenile allograft cartilage and synovium for the repair of meniscal defect in a lapine model,"Synovium has been confirmed to be the primary contributor to meniscal repair. Particulated Juvenile Allograft Cartilage (PJAC) has demonstrated promising clinical effect on repairing cartilage. The synergistic effect of synovium and PJAC transplant on meniscal fibrocartilaginous repair is unclear. We hypothesize that the transplantation of synovium and PJAC synergistically facilitates meniscal regeneration and the donor cells within graft tissues still survive in the regenerated tissue at the last follow up (16 weeks postoperatively).The study included 24 mature female rabbits, which were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. A cylindrical full-thickness defect measuring 2.0 ​mm was prepared in the avascular portion of the anterior horn of medial meniscus in both knees. The synovium and PJAC transplant were harvested from juvenile male rabbits (2 months after birth). The experimental group received synovium and PJAC transplant encapsulated with fibrin gel. The control groups received synovium transplant encapsulated with fibrin gel, pure fibrin gel and nothing. The macroscopic, imageological and histological evaluations of repaired tissue were performed at 8 weeks and 16 weeks postoperatively. The in situ hybridization (ISH) of male-specific sex-determining region Y-linked (SRY) gene was performed to detect the transplanted cells.The regenerated tissue in experimental group showed superior structural integrity, superficial smoothness, and marginal integration compared to control groups at 8 weeks or 16 weeks postoperatively. More meniscus-like fibrochondrocytes filled the repaired tissue in the experimental group, and the matrix surrounding these cell clusters demonstrated strongly positive safranin O and type 2 collagen immunohistochemistry staining. By SRY gene ISH, the positive SRY signal of experimental group could be detected at 8 weeks (75.72%, median) and 16 weeks (48.69%, median). The expression of SOX9 in experimental group was the most robust, with median positive rates of 65.52% at 8 weeks and 67.55% at 16 weeks.The transplantation of synovium and PJAC synergistically facilitates meniscal regeneration. The donor cells survive for at least 16 weeks in the recipient.This study highlighted the positive effect of PJAC and synovium transplant on meniscal repair. We also clarified the potential repair mechanisms reflected by the survival of donor cells and upregulated expression of meniscal fibrochondrocytes related genes. Thus, based on our study, further clinical experiments are needed to investigate synovium and PJAC transplant as a possible treatment to meniscal defects.",0

Consequently, a tissue engineering approach to cartilage regenerative therapy could greatly advance the current treatment options for patients with cartilage degeneration and/or defects. A successful tissue engineering approach would require not only induction of chondrogenic differentiation , but also suppression of subsequent endochondral ossification and chondrocyte dedifferentiation . We previously reported that direct injection of the thienoindazole derivative, TD-198946, into the knee joints of mice halted the progression of osteoarthritis; the compound induced chondrogenic differentiation without promoting endochondral ossification. In the present study, we applied TD-198946 to a cell-based cartilage reconstruction model, taking advantage of the cell-sheet technology. Cartilaginous cell-sheets were generated by culturing mouse and canine costal chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells with TD-198946 on temperature-responsive dishes. The transplanted cell-sheets were then successfully used to promote the reconstruction of permanent cartilage, with no evidence of chondrocyte hypertrophy in the knee articular cartilage defects created in mice and canines. Thus, TD-198946 is a promising candidate for cell-based cartilage reconstruction therapies, enabling us to avoid any concern surrounding the use of scaffolds or cytokines to stimulate regeneration.",0

We propose a novel, scaffold-less technique of cartilage repair in the human knee that combines arthroscopic microfracture and outpatient intra-articular injections of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Materials and Methods: Seventy matched (age, sex, lesion size) knees with symptomatic cartilage defects underwent cartilage repair with the proposed technique (n = 35) or an open technique (n = 35) in which the MSCs were implanted beneath a sutured periosteal patch over the defect. Prospective evaluation of both groups were performed using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Injury Evaluation Package, which included questions from the Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, Lysholm knee scale, and Tegner activity level scale. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was also performed at 1 year for most patients. Results: There were no clinically significant adverse events reported through the course of our study. At the final follow-up (mean = 24.5 months), there was significant improvement in mean IKDC, Lysholm, SF-36 physical component score and visual analogue pain scores in both treatment groups. Conclusion: In the short term, the results of this novel technique are comparable to the open procedure with the added advantages of being minimally invasive and requiring only a single operation under general anaesthesia. Its safety has been validated and its efficacy is currently being evaluated in an ongoing randomised controlled trial. Key words: Chondral, Novel, Osteoarthritis, Regeneration",1
,[Treatment of focal cartilage injuries in the knee].,"Chondrocytes in adult human cartilage have little mitotic capacity even after injuries. Deep injuries penetrating the subchondral bone plate lead to the release of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells which have the potential to differentiate into different types of connective tissue, including bone and cartilage. The release and stimulation of these stem cells can also be achieved by drilling or microfracture of the subchondral bone of cartilage lesions. When stimulated, periosteal cells may also differentiate into chondrocytes. However, non-chondrocyte determined cells seem to induce mainly fibrocartilage. In 1987 autologous chondrocyte implantation was introduced by a team in Gothenburg. This resulted in clinical improvement and the development of hyaline-like cartilage in patients who had undergone treatment. We first used the method in 1996 in a clinical trial. At a 6-month follow-up of our first 12 patients we found reduced symptoms and improved knee function. This method is promising, but further clinical trials are necessary.",0

There is significant interest in understanding how intra-articular injections made from autologous blood or bone marrow could alleviate symptoms and potentially intervene in the progression of the disease. There is in vitro an in vivo evidence that suggests that these therapies, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), autologous anti-inflammatories (AAIs), and concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA), can interrupt cartilage matrix degradation driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review analyzes the evidence for and against inclusion of white blood cells, the potential role of platelets, and the less studied potential role of blood plasma when combining these components to create an autologous point-of-care therapy to treat OA. There has been significant focus on the differences between the various autologous therapies. However, evidence suggests that there may be more in common between groups and perhaps we should be thinking of these therapies on a spectrum of the same technology, each providing significant levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines that can be antagonists against the inflammatory cytokines driving OA symptoms and progression. While clinical data have demonstrated symptom alleviation, more studies will need to be conducted to determine whether these preclinical disease-modifying findings translate into clinical practice.",0

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of MenSCs encapsulated in fibrin glue (FG) on healing of osteochondral defect in rabbit model.We examined the effectiveness of MenSCs encapsulated in FG in comparison with FG alone in the repair of osteochondral defect (OCD) lesions of rabbit knees after 12 and 24 weeks.Macroscopical evaluation revealed that the effectiveness of MenSCs incorporation with FG is much higher than FG alone in repair of OCD defects. Indeed, histopathological evaluation of FG + MenSCs group at 12 weeks post-transplantation demonstrated that defects were filled with hyaline cartilage-like tissue with proper integration, high content of glycosaminoglycan and the existence of collagen fibers especially collagen type II, as well as by passing time (24 weeks post-transplantation), the most regenerated tissue in FG + MenSCs group was similar to hyaline cartilage with relatively good infill and integration. As the same with the result of 12 weeks post-implantation, the total point of microscopical examination in FG + MenSCs group was higher than other experimental groups, however, no significant difference was detected between groups at 24 weeks (p > 0.05).In summary, MenSCs as unique stem cell population, is suitable for in vivo repair of OCD defects and promising for the future clinical application.",0

In vitro MRI was performed with gradient echo (GRE) and spin echo (SE) sequences at 3T and quantitatively characterized using line profile and region of interest analysis. Ex vivo MRI of hydrogel-encapsulated labeled MSCs implanted within a bovine knee was performed with spoiled GRE (SPGR) and T(1ρ) sequences. Fluorescence microscopy, labeling efficiency, and chondrogenesis of MPIO-labeled cells were also examined.MPIO labeling results in efficient contrast uptake and signal loss that can be visualized and quantitatively characterized via MRI. SPGR imaging of implanted cells results in ex vivo detection within native tissue, and T(1ρ) imaging is unaffected by the presence of labeled cells immediately following implantation. MPIO labeling does not affect quantitative glycosaminoglycan production during chondrogenesis, but iron aggregation hinders extracellular matrix visualization. This aggregation may result from excess unincorporated particles following labeling and is an issue that necessitates further investigation.This study demonstrates the promise of MPIO labeling for monitoring cartilage regeneration and highlights its potential in the development of cell-based tissue engineering strategies.",0

Patients with chondral injury have asymptomatic periods followed by others in which discomfort or pain is bearable. The repair of focal cartilage injuries requires a precise diagnosis, a completed knee evaluation to give the correct indication for surgery proportional to the damage and adapted to each patient. Many of the surgical techniques currently performed involve biotechnology. The future of cartilage repair should be based on an accurate diagnosis using new MRI techniques. Clinical studies would allow us to establish the correct indications and surgical techniques implanting biocompatible and biodegradable matrices with or without stem cells and growth factors. Arthroscopic techniques with the design of new instruments can facilitate repair of patella and tibial plateau lesions.",0

Autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty has proven to be a valid option for treatment but donor site morbidity with most frequently used autografts remains a source of concern. This study aims to assess clinical results and safety profile of autologous osteochondral graft from the upper tibio-fibular joint applied to reconstruct symptomatic osteochondral lesions of the knee.Thirty-one patients (22 men and 9 women) with grade 4 cartilage lesions in the knee were operated by mosaicplasty technique using autologous osteochondral graft from the upper tibio-fibular joint, between 1998 and 2006. Clinical assessment included visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Lysholm score. All patients were evaluated by MRI pre- and post-operatively regarding joint congruency as good, fair (inferior to 1 mm incongruence), and poor (incongruence higher than 1 mm registered in any frame). Donor zone status was evaluated according to specific protocol considering upper tibio-fibular joint instability, pain, neurological complications, lateral collateral ligament insufficiency, or ankle complaints.Mean age at surgery was 30.1 years (SD 12.2). In respect to lesion sites, 22 were located in weight-bearing area of medial femoral condyle, 7 in lateral femoral condyle, 1 in trochlea, and 1 in patella. Mean follow-up was 110.1 months (SD 23.2). Mean area of lesion was 3.3 cm2 (SD 1.7), and a variable number of cylinders were used, mean 2.5 (SD 1.3). Mean VAS score improved from 47.1 (SD 10.1) to 20.0 (SD 11.5); p = 0.00. Similarly, mean Lysholm score increased from 45.7 (SD 4.5) to 85.3 (SD 7.0); p = 0.00. The level of patient satisfaction was evaluated, and 28 patients declared to be satisfied/very satisfied and would do surgery again, while 3 declared as unsatisfied with the procedure and would not submit to surgery again. These three patients had lower clinical scores and kept complaints related to the original problem but unrelated to donor zone. MRI score significantly improved at 18-24 months comparing with pre-operative (p = 0.004). No radiographic or clinical complications related to donor zone with implication in activity were registered.This work corroborates that mosaicplasty technique using autologous osteochondral graft from the upper tibio-fibular joint is effective to treat osteochondral defects in the knee joint. No relevant complications related to donor zone were registered.Case series, Level IV.",0

Methods Two groups of 20 patients were arthroscopically treated with microfractures for a symptomatic focal chondral defect of the knee. At the end of surgery, in the experimental group, micro-fragmented stromal-vascular fraction was injected into the joint. Primary end point was WOMAC score at 12 months. Secondary end points were any adverse events, Oxford Knee Score, EQ-5D score, VAS for pain, analgesic and anti-inflammatory consumption. Results All the patients were evaluated at 12-month follow-up. No adverse reactions were noted. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory consumption was similar in both groups. At 1-month follow-up, no differences were noted between groups when compared to pre-operative scores. At 3-month follow-up, patients in both groups improved from the baseline in all variables. Significantly lower VAS scores were found in the experimental group (4.2 +/- 3.2 vs. 5.9 +/- 1.7, p = 0.04). At 6- and 12-month follow-ups, patients in the experimental group scored better in all outcomes with a moderate effect size; in particular, better WOMAC scores were obtained at 12 months, achieving the primary end-point of the study (17.7 +/- 11.1 vs. 25.5 +/- 12.7; p = 0.03). Conclusions Injection of micro-fragmented stromal-vascular fraction is safe and, when associated with microfractures, is more effective in clinical terms than microfractures alone in patients affected by symptomatic focal chondral lesions of the knee. Results of the current study provide information that could help physicians to improve their counseling for patients concerning ADMSCs.",1

Previous in vitro studies have shown that ascorbic acid and reduced iron independently can improve the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, the combined effect of ascorbic acid and iron supplementation on MSC differentiation has not been investigated.To investigate the combined in vivo effects of ascorbic acid and a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved iron supplement on MSC-mediated cartilage repair in mature Göttingen minipigs.Controlled laboratory study.We pretreated bone marrow-derived MSCs with ascorbic acid and the FDA-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol and then transplanted the MSCs into full-thickness cartilage defects in the distal femurs of Göttingen minipigs. Untreated cartilage defects served as negative controls. We evaluated the cartilage repair site with magnetic resonance imaging at 4 and 12 weeks after MSC implantation, followed by histological examination and immunofluorescence staining at 12 weeks.Ascorbic acid plus iron-pretreated MSCs demonstrated a significantly better MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score (73.8 ± 15.5), better macroscopic cartilage regeneration score according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (8.6 ± 2.0), better Pineda score (2.9 ± 0.8), and larger amount of collagen type II (28,469 ± 21,313) compared with untreated controls (41.3 ± 2.5, 1.8 ± 2.9, 12.8 ± 1.9, and 905 ± 1326, respectively). The obtained scores were also better than scores previously reported in the same animal model for MSC implants without ascorbic acid.Pretreatment of MSCs with ascorbic acid and an FDA-approved iron supplement improved the chondrogenesis of MSCs and led to hyaline-like cartilage regeneration in the knee joints of minipigs.Ascorbic acid and iron supplements are immediately clinically applicable. Thus, these results, in principle, could be translated into clinical applications.",0

After initial success at-bench, most tissue growth strategies are tested in animals. In vivo animal models of cartilage tissue engineering provide a proof-of-concept validation for promising at-bench tissue-growth strategies. A number of animal models such as mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, dogs, and horses have been used for the purpose of validating emerging cartilage tissue-engineering approaches. Out of all the available choices for monitoring cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration in vivo, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most suitable and is the leading imaging modality for noninvasive longitudinal quantitative monitoring of cartilage tissue growth and regeneration. This chapter describes advances made in MRI assessment and monitoring of cartilage tissue engineering in vivo during the last decade.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) promises to regenerate hyaline articular cartilage, but conventional ACI is plagued by complications determined by periosteal grafting. Here we propose the utilization of collagen membrane in ACI as an effective bioscaffold for the regeneration of osteochondral lesions. Using a rabbit model of osteochondral injury, we have inoculated autologous chondrocytes onto a type I/III collagen scaffold [so-called matrix-induced ACI (MACI)] and implanted into 3-mm osteochondral knee defects. All untreated defect histology showed inferior fibrocartilage and/or fibrous tissue repair. In our time-course study, ACI with type I/III collagen membrane regenerated cartilage with healthy osteochondral architecture in osteochondral defects at 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, articular cartilage regeneration was maintained, with reduced thickness and proteoglycan compared with the adjacent cartilage. Both 6-week (p < 0.01) and 12-week (p < 0.05) ACI with collagen membrane showed significant improvement as compared with untreated controls. To further examine the efficacy of cartilage regeneration by ACI, we conducted a dose-response study, using chondrocytes at various cell densities between 10(4) and 10(6) cells/cm(2). The results showed that cell density had no effect on outcome histology, but all cell densities were significantly better than untreated controls (p < 0.01) and cell-free collagen membrane treatment (p < 0.05). In short, our data suggest that autologous chondrocyte-seeded type I/III collagen membrane is an effective method for the treatment of focal osteochondral knee injury in rabbits.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-05976-9,Excellent histological results in terms of articular cartilage regeneration after spheroid-based autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI),"Abstract Purpose Traumatic lesions of articular cartilage represent a crucial risk factor for osteoarthritis. Even if several strategies exist to treat such damages, the optimal solution has not yet been found. A new strategy represents the scaffold-free spheroid-based autologous chondrocyte transplantation. In this method, spheroids of chondrocytes are synthesized after chondrocyte isolation and expansion, followed by the implantation in a second intervention. Methods Fine Jamshidi-needle biopsies from five patients (one from each patient, Ø 2 mm) treated with a spheroid-based autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) after traumatic lesions of the articular cartilage of the knee were analysed histologically and immunohistologically for collagen II, collagen X and aggrecan expression. The indication for a second look arthroscopy was given by arthrofibrosis or meniscus-lesions, respectively. The time between ACI and second-look arthroscopy ranged between 6 and 16 months. Results In all patients, the histological examinations revealed an avascular cartilage tissue with a homogenic extracellular matrix. The subchondral bone neither showed bleeding, necrosis nor hypertrophy. A homogenous alcian blue staining indicated high amounts of mucopolysaccharides and glycosaminoglycans. Collagen II staining was highly positive, whereas collagen X staining was negative in every patient, ruling out hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. In addition, intense aggrecan staining indicated a strong expression of this extracellular matrix component. Conclusion The present case series represents the first histological and immunohistological analyses of spheroid-based ACI in humans. Spheroid-based ACI revealed excellent histological results regarding the regeneration of hyaline articular cartilage. These results indicate that spheroid based ACI is a promising strategy for treating traumatic lesions of the articular cartilage of the knee.",0

However, radiographic healing after this procedure has not been well documented. Purpose: To develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based scoring system specific for evaluating healing after single-plug OG in COCD and to evaluate correlation between radiographic healing and early clinical outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Between 2014 and 2017, 183 elbows with COCD were enrolled in a prospective registry. A total of 61 elbows in 59 patients underwent single-plug OG. Of these, 52 elbows in 50 patients had pre- and postoperative MRI scans. Postoperative MRI and clinical outcome data from this group were used to develop the novel BOGIE score (Boston Osteochondral Graft Incorporation in the Elbow), with a possible range of 4 to 12. Results: Median age at surgery was 14.2 years (interquartile range, 13.1-15.0 years). Median clinical follow-up after OG was 12.4 months (interquartile range, 9.5-16.9 months; range, 6-53 months). Compared with before surgery, elbow function at 6 months after surgery and at latest follow-up was significantly improved as measured by the Timmerman and Andrews score (TAS; median: 145 before surgery, 185 at 6 months after surgery, 190 at latest follow-up; P &lt; .001, before vs after surgery), as well as the short version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score; median: 21 before surgery, 7 at 6 months after surgery, and 0 at latest follow-up; P &lt; .001 before surgery vs after surgery). Median BOGIE score at 6 months after surgery was 10 (range, 4-12). BOGIE score intraobserver reliability was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.94) for reader 1 and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95) for reader 2. Interobserver reliability between the readers was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78-0.92). Correlation was observed between the 6-month BOGIE score and the concurrent postoperative objective TAS ( P &lt; .001) as well as total TAS ( P = .01) but not the subjective TAS ( P = .08). Patients who underwent subsequent secondary surgery for persistent symptoms had a significantly lower postoperative BOGIE score at 6 months than those who did not (median, 7.8 vs 10.3; P = .016) Conclusion: Quantitative evaluation for radiologic healing after single-plug OG in COCD is possible. The MRI-based BOGIE score appears to correlate with early clinical function and may be useful as an adjunct tool in decision making on activity progression. The use of a standardized MRI score may improve comparability of outcomes after OG in the literature.",0

https://doi.org/10.1504/ijnt.2021.114229,Study on the ability of type I collagen bioactive nanomaterial scaffold to repair spontaneous cartilage injury,"Objective: Natural bone tissue can be considered as a complex composed of type I collagen and light-based apatite with low crystallinity. Choosing type I collagen and light-based apatite as bone repair materials can realise the biomimetic of natural bone. Chitosan is easy to mix with collagen, and the interaction of the two at the molecular level can make the complex of the two more stable than any single component. However, due to the poor mechanical properties of collagen and chitosan, the high swelling degree of collagen, the greater brittleness of light-based apatite, and the incompatibility with organics, the high swelling degree and the rapid degradation of this material limit the use of similar materials in bone tissue engineering. In this paper, the ultrastructure of type I collagen scaffolds is analysed; goat knee cartilage defect models are established using green goats as experimental animals. Fifteen 12-month-old goats are randomly divided into three groups, each with 10 knees, and group A is blank, the control group, group B is a simple collagen I collagen double-layer scaffold group, and group C is a type I collagen double-layer scaffold combined with MSCs transplantation group, which is treated according to the experimental group; materials are taken at 6 weeks and 24 weeks after the operation gross observation and histological scores were used to evaluate the repair effect of each group. Successfully established goat knee cartilage defect model and type I double-layer collagen scaffold composite autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) implantation technology. At 24 weeks postoperative MRI, there was no effusion in the articular cavity and no synovial hyperplasia. The repair tissue in the experimental group had no difference in signal from normal cartilage; the repair tissue was observed to be flat with normal cartilage and similar in colour to normal cartilage. Histology confirmed the repaired tissue as hyaline cartilage. The Waitangi score in the experimental group was 2.65 ± 1.36, which was significantly better than that in the stent group alone (7.04 ± 2.14) and the blank control group (10.87 ± 3.51). The blank control group and the stent group had poor repair effect.",0

However, it is difficult for endogenous cells to migrate into ECM derived from native cartilage owing to its nonporous structure and dense nature. Moreover, current decellularization approaches frequently lead to architectural breakdown and potential loss of surface composition of ECM. To solve this problem, we aimed to establish a novel biological ECM scaffold from chondrocyte sheets for cartilage regeneration. We cultured chondrocytes harvested from the auricular cartilage of 4-week-old New Zealand rabbits and enabled them to form cell sheets. These sheets were decellularized using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with three different concentrations, namely, 1%, 5%, and 10%, followed by 1% Triton X-100 and deoxyribonuclease enzyme solution. In vitro microstructural examination and mechanical tests demonstrated that 1% SDS not only removed chondrocytes completely but also maintained the native architecture and composition of ECM, thus avoiding the use of high-concentration SDS. Application of decellularized chondrocyte sheets for osteochondral defects in rabbits resulted in substantial host remodeling and variant regeneration of osteochondral tissues. One percent SDS-treated decellularized chondrocyte sheets contributed to the superior reconstruction of osteochondral defects as compared with 5% and 10% SDS groups, which includes vascularized subchondral bone, articular cartilage with adequate thickness, and integration with host tissues. Furthermore, ECM from 1% SDS significantly increased the migrating potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro. RT-PCR and western blot also revealed that ECM increased the expression of SOX-9 in BMSCs, whereas it decreased COL-X expression. In conclusion, our results suggested that the chondrocyte sheets decellularized with 1% SDS preserved the integrity and bioactivity, which favored cell recruitment and enabled osteochondral regeneration in the knee joints of rabbits, thus offering a promising approach for articular cartilage reconstruction without cell transplantation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although biological extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from decellularized native cartilage has been widely used in cartilage regeneration, it is difficult for endogenous cells to migrate into ECM owing to its dense nature. Moreover, current decellularization approaches lead to architectural breakdown of ECM. This study established a novel biological ECM from decellularized chondrocyte sheets for cartilage regeneration. Our results suggested that cartilaginous ECM favored cell recruitment and enabled osteochondral regeneration in rabbits, thus offering a promising approach for articular cartilage reconstruction without cell transplantation. SDS 1% adequately decellularized the chondrocytes in cell sheets, whereas it maintained the native architecture and composition of ECM, thereby avoiding the use of high-concentration SDS and providing a new way to acquire cartilaginous ECM.",0
https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.35391,Transplantation of human ESC-derived mesenchymal stem cell spheroids ameliorates spontaneous osteoarthritis in rhesus macaques,"It has been demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), name EMSCs, can treat a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, with similar efficacies to those achieved with MSCs derived from somatic tissues such as bone marrow (BMSCs). The chance increases even higher for EMSCs, than somatic tissue derived MSCs​, to become a cell drug as the former can be produced in large scale from an unlimited hESC line with easier quality control and less biosafety concern. We have further demonstrated that both human ESCs and EMSCs, after aggregation to form spheroids, can tolerate hypoxic and ambient conditions (AC) for over 4 and 10 days, respectively, without loss of their viability and alteration of their functions. Based on these advantages, we decided to test whether EMSC spheroids, made in large quantity and delivered through a long-term distance at AC, can treat osteoarthritis spontaneously developed in rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) monkeys as well as the allogenic MSCs. Methods: Xenogeneic AC-transported EMSC spheroids or allogenic BMSCs were injected into the articular cavity of both knees of the monkeys at 3 animals per group. Another two macaques were injected the same way with saline as controls. Results: Both EMSCs and BMSCs groups showed significant amelioration indicated by the reduction of swelling joint size and amplification of keen flare angle post-treatment, compared to the control group. Examinations via X-ray and MRI also indicated the decrease of inflammation and osteophyma, and recovery of the synovium and cartilage in both treated groups. No sign of allergy or graft versus host disease was observed in the animals. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that human EMSC spheroids can prevent the osteoarthtitis progression and ameliorate osteoarthritis in the rhesus macaques as well as allogenic BMSCs, and this study shall help advance the clinical application of EMSCs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tec.2018.0219,Human Synovial Mesenchymal Stem Cells Good Manufacturing Practices for Articular Cartilage Regeneration,"Background: Cartilage restoration is a desperately needed bridge for patients with symptomatic cartilage lesions. Chondral lesion is a pathology with high prevalence, reaching as much as 63% of general population and 36% among athletes. Despite autologous chondrocyte implantation versatility, it still fails to fully reproduce hyaline articular cartilage characteristics. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be isolated from various known tissues, including discarded fragments at arthroscopy such as synovial membrane. Choice of harvesting site is motivated by MSCs' abilities to modulate immunologic and inflammatory response through paracrine communication. Synovial MSCs have a greater proliferation and strong chondrogenic potential than bone and adipose MSCs and a less hypertrophic differentiation than bone MSCs. Good manufacturing practice (GMP) laboratory techniques for human clinical trials are still novel. To our knowledge, there are only two clinical trials in humans published since today. Purpose: Therefore, this work aimed to isolate and characterize synovial MSCs and evaluated their differentiation properties according to GMP standards. Materials and Methods: One-gram tissue sample from three patients of synovia was harvested at the beginning of arthroscopy surgery. MSCs were isolated, expanded, and characterized by flow cytometry. Results: It was possible to isolate and expand MSCs cultures from synovia, characterize MSCs by flow cytometry using proper monoclonal antibodies, and differentiate MSCs by coloring technique after chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic differentiations. Cartilage treatment may benefit from these tissue engineering protocols since arthroscopic procedures are routinely performed for different purposes in a previous stage and a favorable chondronegic differentiation cell lineage may be collected and stored in a less invasive way. Conclusion: Laboratory protocols established according to presented GMP were able to isolate and characterize MSCs obtained from synovia. Impact Statement Articular cartilage restoration is a desperately needed bridge for patients with symptomatic cartilage lesions and it rises as a socioeconomic issue with a considerable economic burden. Synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a greater proliferation rate and strong chondrogenic potential than bone and adipose MSCs and a less hypertrophic differentiation than bone MSCs. To our knowledge, there are only two human clinical trials with good manufacturing practice laboratory techniques for synovial MSCs harvesting and differentiation. Cartilage treatment may benefit from these tissue engineering protocols since arthroscopic procedures are routinely performed for different purposes in a previous stage.",0

A treatment gap exists for patients with lesions not suitable for arthroplasty or biologic repair or who have failed prior cartilage repair surgery. This study reports on the early clinical and functional outcomes in patients undergoing treatment with an individualised mini-metal implant for an isolated focal chondral defect in the knee. Methods Open-label, multicentre, non-randomised, non-comparative retrospective observational analysis of prospectively collected clinical data in a consecutive series of 80 patients undergoing knee reconstruction with the Episealer® implant. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and VAS scores, were recorded preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Results Seventy-five patients were evaluated at a minimum 24 months following implantation. Two patients had undergone revision (2.5%), 1 declined participation, and 2 had not completed the full data requirements, leaving 75 of the 80 with complete data for analysis. All 5 KOOS domain mean scores were significantly improved at 1 and 2 years ( p &lt; 0.001–0.002). Mean preoperative aggregated KOOS4 of 35 (95% CI 33.5–37.5) improved to 57 (95% CI 54.5–60.2) and 59 (95% CI 55.7–61.6) at 12 and 24 months respectively ( p &lt; 0.05). Mean VAS score improved from 63 (95% CI 56.0–68.1) preoperatively to 32 (95% CI 24.4–38.3) at 24 months. The improvement exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and this improvement was maintained over time. Location of defect and history of previous cartilage repair did not significantly affect the outcome ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion The study suggests that at 2 years, Episealer® implants are safe with a low failure rate of 2.5% and result in clinically significant improvement. Individualised mini-metal implants with appropriate accurate guides for implantation appear to have a place in the management of focal femoral chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-018-1123-7,Ex vivo MRI cell tracking of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells in an ovine osteochondral defect model,"Osteochondral injuries represent a significant clinical problem requiring novel cell-based therapies to restore function of the damaged joint with the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) leading research efforts. Pre-clinical studies are fundamental in translating such therapies; however, technologies to minimally invasively assess in vivo cell fate are currently limited. We investigate the potential of a MRI- (magnetic resonance imaging) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION)-based technique to monitor cellular bio-distribution in an ovine osteochondral model of acute and chronic injuries. MSCs were isolated, expanded and labelled with Nanomag, a 250-nm SPION, and using a novel cell-penetrating technique, glycosaminoglycan-binding enhanced transduction (GET). MRI visibility thresholds, cellular toxicity and differentiation potential post-labelling were assessed in vitro. A single osteochondral defect was created in the medial femoral condyle in the left knee joint of each sheep with the contralateral joint serving as the control. Cells, either GET-Nanomag labelled or unlabelled, were delivered 1 week or 4.5 weeks later. Sheep were sacrificed 7 days post implantation and immediately MR imaged using a 0.2-T MRI scanner and validated on a 3-T MRI scanner prior to histological evaluation. MRI data demonstrated a significant increase in MRI contrast as a result of GET-Nanomag labelling whilst cell viability, proliferation and differentiation capabilities were not affected. MRI results revealed evidence of implanted cells within the synovial joint of the injured leg of the chronic model only with no signs of cell localisation to the defect site in either model. This was validated histologically determining the location of implanted cells in the synovium. Evidence of engulfment of Nanomag-labelled cells by leukocytes is observed in the injured legs of the chronic model only. Finally, serum c-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured by ELISA with no obvious increase in CRP levels observed as a result of P21-8R:Nanomag delivery. This study has the potential to be a powerful translational tool with great implications in the clinical translation of stem cell-based therapies. Further, we have demonstrated the ability to obtain information linked to key biological events occurring post implantation, essential in designing therapies and selecting pre-clinical models.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100234,Repair of osteochondral defects mediated by double-layer scaffolds with natural osteochondral-biomimetic microenvironment and interface,"Tissue engineering provides a new approach for the treatment of osteochondral defects. However, the lack of an ideal double-layer scaffold with osteochondral-biomimetic microenvironment and interface similar to native articular tissue greatly limits clinical translation. Our current study developed a double-layer acellular osteochondral matrix (AOM) scaffold with natural osteochondral-biomimetic microenvironment and interface by integrating ultraviolet (UV) laser and decellularization techniques. The laser parameters were optimized to achieve a proper pore depth close to the osteochondral interface, which guaranteed complete decellularization, sufficient space for cell loading, and relative independence of the chondrogenic and osteogenic microenvironments. Gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel was further used as the cell carrier to significantly enhance the efficiency and homogeneity of cell loading in the AOM scaffold with large pore structure. Additionally, in vitro results demonstrated that the components of the AOM scaffold could efficiently regulate the chondrogenic/osteogenic differentiations of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by activating the chondrogenic/osteogenic related pathways. Importantly, the AOM scaffolds combined with BMSC-laden GelMA hydrogel successfully realized tissue-specific repair of the osteochondral defects in a knee joint model of rabbit. The current study developed a novel double-layer osteochondral biomimetic scaffold and feasible strategy, providing strong support for the tissue-specific repair of osteochondral defects and its future clinical translation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1618592,Cartilage Restoration: Microfracture and Osteochondral Autograft Transplantation,"Abstract The treatment of patellofemoral cartilage defects presents several distinct challenges when compared with cartilage restoration techniques used for other compartments of the knee due to the unique anatomy and distribution of forces. The etiologies of patellofemoral articular cartilage lesions include acute traumatic instability injuries, such as dislocation and subluxation, osteochondritis dissecans, and chronic degenerative changes. Regardless of the etiology, untreated patellofemoral cartilage lesions can contribute to activity-limiting anterior knee pain. The goal of patellofemoral cartilage restoration procedures is to impart symptomatic relief and improve quality of life by repairing the articular cartilage surface and any comorbid malalignment or maltracking. Microfracture and osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) are two cartilage restoration procedures to consider when treating full-thickness patellofemoral chondral defects. Considered by some experts to be the gold standard therapy, microfracture is one of the most common procedures used for cartilage restoration. The technique involves the perforation of the subchondral bone plate for the release of marrow elements, filling the defect with a fibrocartilage clot repair. Though less commonly used, OAT allows defect replacement with native hyaline cartilage via autologous transplantation from a non-weight bearing area. The purpose of this article is to discuss the indication, technical considerations, and outcomes of microfracture and OAT when used for treating chondral lesions of the patellofemoral joint.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546510363433,Can Osteochondral Grafting Be Augmented With Microfracture in an Extended-Size Lesion of Articular Cartilage?,"Background: Both microfracture and osteochondral autografting procedures have been useful in treating osteochondral lesions. Hypothesis: Combining microfracture and osteochondral autografting procedures can extend the size of lesions that can be treated with either technique. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Eight adult goats underwent osteochondral autograft transfer of a 4.5-mm femoral trochlea plug into an 8-mm full-thickness chondral defect. Microfracture was performed in the gap region surrounding the autograft. The animals were allowed normal activity until the end of the experiment at 6 months. At harvest, the knees were assessed grossly, and then evaluation was performed by histology, histomorphometry, biochemistry, and biomechanics. Results: The osteochondral plugs healed well, with integration of the bone and preservation of the chondral cap. The chondral gap between the host site articular cartilage and the transferred plug had decreased from 3 mm at implant to less than 0.1 mm. Histologic analysis demonstrated regions of variable cartilage repair, with integration of the cartilage layer at some sites but incomplete healing at others. Histomorphometry demonstrated filling of the chondral gap to 75% to 85% of the normal volume. Biochemical analysis revealed greater than 90% type II collagen at most sites, with some areas containing 80% type II collagen. Biomechanical indentation testing indicated that the repaired area had variable thickness and stiffness, with a trend of increased stiffness in the bulk graft and decreased softness at the proximal microfracture interface site. Conclusion: The performance of a combined microfracture and osteochondral autograft transfer procedure to resurface a large chondral defect appears promising. Clinical Relevance: This combined technique shows promise for treatment of large chondral defects with a single operative procedure with autogenous tissue that is safe and potentially would have a shorter period of rehabilitation, similar to that of osteochondral transfers and microfracture, in a cost-effective setting.",0

Twenty-four patients (mean age 29.9±8.7, 70.8% male) undergoing arthroscopic OAT between 1997 and 2000 were prospectively enrolled. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS)/International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores and Tegner scores were employed for clinical evaluation. The magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) was utilized for description and assessment of the repair tissue. Median follow up was 113 months (interquartile range [IQR] 106-122). MRI showed good survival of grafted cartilage in 62.5% of patients. The integration of the graft was complete in 75% of cases, while the repaired tissue was intact in 62.5% and had an homogeneous structure in 70.8%. The MOCART score significantly correlated with objective and subjective scores (p=0.003 and p=0.002). Contrastingly, overall MOCART showed no correlation with the Tegner score. MRI revealed to be a powerful tool for non-invasive long-term assessment of OAT.",0

Thirty-six medial femoral condyles were divided into 6 groups using different proportion of gene enhanced tissue engineering and mosaicplasty to restore the defects. The specimen received gross and histology observation, which was evaluated by the histological grading scale of O'Driscoll, Keeley and Salter. Transmission electron microscope observation was also performed. Two factors analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Kewls test were used to compare the specimen.The gross and histology observation revealed that each defects of six groups had different restoration. The scores of the reparative tissue of three groups with gene enhancement were significantly higher than those in other three groups without gene enhancement (p > 0.05).Gene enhanced tissue engineering followed mosaicplasty could restore a 9 mm diameter osteochondral defects in a goat model effectively. With the reduction of covering area of the graft, the advantages of the combined gene enhanced tissue engineering method can be better reflected.",0

Design OAT grafts were harvested from lateral femoral condyles (LFCs) and transplanted into osteochondral defects created in medial femoral condyles (MFCs) of contralateral knees. OCA grafts were transplanted into MFC condyles after in vitro storage. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was administered intraarticularly after the surgery and at 1 and 2 months postoperatively. OAT and OCA grafts were evaluated macroscopically (Oswestry arthroscopy score [OAS]), electromechanically (quantitative parameter, QP), and histologically (O’Driscoll score, safranin O staining intensity) at 3 and 6 months after transplantation. Results were compared with preoperative graft evaluation. Results Transplanted cartilage deteriorated within 6 months in all groups. Cartilage quality was better retained in OAT group compared with a decline in OCA group. QP and OAS scores were comparable in OAT and OCA groups at 3 months, but superior in OAT group at 6 months, according to all the methods applied. PRP injections significantly improved QP and OAS score at 6 months compared with 3 months in OAT group. QP moderately correlated with OAS, O’Driscoll score, and safranin O staining intensity. Conclusions Grafts did not retain preoperative quality parameters at 6 months follow-up; however, OAT were superior to OCA grafts. PRP may have a beneficial effect on macroscopic and electromechanical properties of cartilage; however, histological improvement is yet to be proved. Electromechanical diagnostic device enables reliable assessment of transplanted cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/jsa.0b013e31818cdb82,Overview of Existing Cartilage Repair Technology,"Currently, autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral grafting bridge the gap between palliation of cartilage injury and resurfacing via arthroplasty. Emerging technologies seek to advance first generation techniques and accomplish several goals including predictable outcomes, cost-effective technology, single-stage procedures, and creation of durable repair tissue. The biologic pipeline represents a variety of technologies including synthetics, scaffolds, cell therapy, and cell-infused matrices. Synthetic constructs, an alternative to biologic repair, resurface a focal chondral defect rather than the entire joint surface. Scaffolds are cell-free constructs designed as a biologic ""net"" to augment marrow stimulation techniques. Minced cartilage technology uses stabilized autologous or allogeneic fragments in 1-stage transplantation. Second and third generation cell-based methods include alternative membranes, chondrocyte seeding, and culturing onto scaffolds. Despite the promising early results of these products, significant technical obstacles remain along with unknown long-term durability. The vast array of developing technologies has exceptional promise and the potential to revolutionize the cartilage treatment algorithm within the next decade.",0

Symptomatic full-thickness defects in young patients that are located in the medial or lateral femoral condyle, trochlea, or patella and range in size from 3 cm2 to 10 cm2 as well as defects of the ventral talus are indications for autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT). Another indication for ACT are cartilage defects for which previous operative measures have failed. Osteoarthritis and kissing lesions are contraindications. Axial malalignment and knee joint instability need to be corrected. Second-generation ACT procedures are based on three-dimensional biomaterials in which the articular chondrocytes are seeded prior to implantation. Randomized trials demonstrate clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings that are similar to marrow-stimulating techniques such as microfracture. Long-term studies are needed to determine the effect of ACT on the development of osteoarthritis.",0

Design At 4 weeks postoperative marrow stimulation model bilaterally (3 mm diameter; 4 mm depth) in the medial femoral condyle, autologous MSCs were injected into knee joint. Twenty-four Japanese rabbits aged 6 months were divided randomly into 4 groups ( n = 6 per group): the control group and and MSC groups including 0.125, 1.25, and 6.25 million MSCs. Repaired tissue was assessed macroscopically and histologically at 4 and 12 weeks after intraarticular injection of MSCs. Results At 12 weeks, there was no repair tissue in the control group. The gross appearance of the 1.25 and 6.25 million MSC groups revealed complete repair of the defect with white to pink tissue at 12 weeks. An osteochondral repair was histologically significantly better in the 1.25 and 6.25 million MSC groups than in the control and 0.125 million MSC groups at 4 and 12 weeks, due to presence of hyaline-like tissue in the deep layer at 4 weeks, and at 12 weeks hyaline cartilage formation at the periphery and fibrous tissue containing some chondrocytes in the deep layer of the center of the defect. Subchondral bone was restructured in the 1.25 and 6.25 million MSC groups, although it did not resemble the normal bone. Conclusion An intraarticular injection of 1.25 or 6.25 million MSCs could promote the repair of subchondral bone, even in the case of midterm osteochondral defect.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1606575,"Comparison of Platelet-Rich Plasma, Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), or SVF with an Injectable PLGA Nanofiber Scaffold for the Treatment of Osteochondral Injury in Dogs","Abstract Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) contains a small number of mesenchymal stem cells and has been used as a treatment for osteoarthritis and cartilage injury. Due to limited evidence of successful cartilage regeneration with injected stem cell therapies, there is interest in combining cellular therapies with injectable scaffolding materials to increase intra-articular residence times of stem cells and improve tissue regeneration. However, the safety of intra-articular injection of SVF combined with injectable scaffolds is unestablished. Also, it is unclear if SVF therapy is superior to more easily prepared biologics, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of SVF when combined with an injectable poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanofiber scaffold and to provide a comparison of SVF therapy to PRP. A total of 12 Beagles had osteochondral defects created in both medial femoral condyles and 4 dogs each were allocated to treatment groups of SVF (n = 4), SVF plus PLGA scaffolding (n = 4), or leukoreduced PRP (n = 4). One knee in each dog received treatment, and the contralateral knee was sham treated with saline. Dogs were assessed over a 6-month period, and outcome measures included functional, radiographic, biochemical, and histological assessments. PRP treatment resulted in improvements in lameness scores and objective kinetic assessments of function. There were no statistically significant improvements in function, cartilage biochemical composition, or histology for SVF-treated knees. The combination of SVF and the injectable PLGA scaffold had worse outcomes than other groups including sham treatment based upon functional, biochemical, and histological assessments, raising concerns over the safety of this scaffold for intra-articular injection.",0

Both autologous chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds and non-seeded scaffolds were implanted into two defects located in the non-weight-bearing zone of the femoral trochlea (defect A was located more distally and medially, defect B was located more proximally and laterally). Control defects were left untreated. Twelve weeks after the operation, the knees were evaluated in vivo using MRI. Six months after the implantation, the defects were analyzed using MRI, histological, and immunohistochemical analysis. In the A defects of chondrocyte-seeded scaffold group, hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage was formed, containing type II collagen, acidic and neutral glycosaminoglycans while the non-seeded scaffold group was predominantly filled with fibrocartilage. Defects in the control group were predominantly filled with fibrous tissue. Histomorphometric analysis of photomicrographs revealed a significantly higher amount of hyaline cartilage in the cell-seeded scaffold group in A defects than in other groups. Both scaffold groups in A defects showed significantly less fibrous tissue than cell-seeded defects B and the control group. Both histological and MRI analysis proved that the novel composite scaffold has a potential to regenerate osteochondral defects within six months.",0

Materials and methods Inclusion criteria were patients older than 60 years, with a kissing lesion of the MC, a full-thickness chondral defect \textbackslashtextgreater= 4 cm(2) of the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and a varus deformity \textbackslashtextgreater= 3 degrees on a long cassette scanogram. The mean age was 64.9 +/- 4.4 years and the mean chondral defect of the MFC was 7.2 +/- 1.9 cm(2). A mixture of sodium hyaluronate and hUCB-MSC was implanted into the chondral defect and a high tibial osteotomy was performed in all patients. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), visual analog scale (VAS), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores were evaluated preoperatively and 1 year and 2 years postoperatively. Cartilage regeneration was evaluated in 14 (56%) patients by second-look arthroscopy at 1 year postoperatively. Results Twenty-five patients underwent hUBC-MSC implantation. IKDC, VAS, and WOMAC scores at 1 year and 2 years improved significantly compared to preoperative scores. These scores at 1 year and 2 years were not significantly different between the body mass index (BMI) \textbackslashtextless 25 group and BMI \textbackslashtextgreater= 25 group. However, the \textbackslashtextless 65-year-old group showed superior IKDC scores at 1 year and 2 years and VAS score at 2 years than the \textbackslashtextgreater= 65-year-old group. Younger age and larger size of the chondral defect were associated with a significantly greater improvement in IKDC, VAS and WOMAC scores at 2 years. Second-look arthroscopy demonstrated International Cartilage Repair Society-Cartilage Repair Assessment grade I in six (42.9%) patients and grade II in eight (57.1%).

Implantation of autologous LhCG was done at load-bearing regions of the knees in skeletally mature mini-pigs for 6 months. Over the course of this study, significant radiographical improvement in LhCG treated sites was observed via magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, macroscopic repair was effected by LhCG at endpoint. Microscopic inspection revealed that LhCG engraftment restored cartilage thickness, promoted integration with surrounding native cartilage, produced abundant cartilage-specific matrix molecules and re-established an intact superficial tangential zone. Importantly, the repair efficacy of LhCG was quantitatively shown to be comparable to native, unaffected cartilage in terms of biochemical composition and biomechanical properties. There were no complications related to the donor site of cartilage biopsy. Collectively, these results imply that LhCG engraftment may be a viable approach for articular cartilage repair.",0

A prefabricated template was used to create cartilage defects of 2 cm(2) in the medial femoral condyle. A size-matched collagen patch was fashioned. Four methods of fixation to the chondral defect were analyzed: group 1-saline, group 2-fibrin glue around the periphery of the patch, group 3-fibrin glue applied to the base of the defect and around the periphery of the patch, group 4-6-0 vicryl suture and fibrin glue around the periphery of the patch. Collagen patch fixation was assessed at intervals of 60, 300, 600, 900, and 1,200 cycles from full extension to 90° of flexion, performed manually without application of axial force. Patch fixation was evaluated by 2 independent observers using a customized scoring scale.Mean peripheral detachment of the patch and chondral defect uncovering remained less than 25% for all groups. Area of defect uncovering was significantly increased in group 2 compared with group 4 after 900 and 1,200 cycles (P = .0014 and P = .0025, respectively). Fibrin glue applied to the base of the defect, or suturing of the patch, reduced deformation significantly after 900 cycles.Suture increases the stability of fixation of a type I/III collagen patch to a chondral defect better than fibrin glue alone in the porcine knee after repetitive cycling, with respect to patch detachment and chondral defect uncovering. Application of fibrin glue to the base of the defect, or securing the patch with suture, decreases collagen patch deformation.In cases where minimally invasive techniques do not allow suture fixation of the collagen patch, scaffold fixation may be compromised during articular motion protocols typically used after second- and third-generation ACI procedures.",0

Twenty-three patients with grade III to IV cartilage damage and valgus knee alignment were treated with medial closing wedge osteotomy at the distal femur. The osteotomy was stabilized with an internal plate fixator. Age varied between 25 and 55 years (mean 47 years). One patient was lost to final follow-up. After 3.5 years, all Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subitems increased significantly. There was no significant difference in the subgroup analysis of KOOS subitems for patients with and without microfracture or age (\textbackslashtextgreater 50 vs. \textbackslashtextless 50 years). There were no perioperative complications. One patient had an overcorrection. All, but one osteotomy, showed stable bone healing. There was a loss of correction due to delayed bone healing in one case. Possible explanations for this complication were injury of the lateral cortex or smoking. This case required revision with bone graft and an additional lateral plate. In no case, a conversion to an endoprosthesis was necessary. The femoral medial closing wedge osteotomy is a surgical method for improving symptoms of lateral osteoarthritis in the valgus knee. IV.",0

The present study compared four different scaffold fixation techniques [fibrin glue (FG), transosseous (TS) fixation, biodegradable pin (BP) fixation and continuous cartilage sutures (CS)] to implant a custom-printed porous PEOT/PBT1000/70/30 scaffold in a human cadaver knee model.After implantation, the knees were subjected to a vertically oriented loaded continuous passive motion (CPM) protocol. The fixation techniques were evaluated after 60 and a subsequent 150 motion cycles, focusing on area coverage, outline attachment and scaffold integrity. After the total of 210 cycles, also an endpoint fixation test was performed.The fixation techniques revealed marginal differences for area coverage and outline attachment after 60 and 150 cycles. The FG scored higher on scaffold integrity compared to TS (P<0.05) and CS (P=0.01). Endpoint fixation was highest for the CS, whereas FG showed a weak final fixation strength (P=0.01).This study showed that optimal fixation cannot be combined always with high scaffold integrity. Special attention devoted to scaffold properties in relation to the fixation technique may result in an improvement of scaffold fixation, and thus clinical cartilage regenerative approaches involving these scaffolds.",0

Gadolinium injection was used in nine patients. Clinical symptoms resolved within a few weeks in all 13 cases.T1-weighted images without gadolinium showed diffuse low signal from the epiphysis (n = 12) containing an area of even lower signal seen either as a crescent-shaped subchondral image (n = 3/12) or as a linear image (n = 9/12). On postgadolinium images, the low signal was abolished except for a line of low signal parallel to the subchondral bone. T2-weighted images demonstrated diffuse high signal from the medial tibial plateau with persistence of the line of low signal (n = 8/12).Magnetic resonance imaging allows to analyze the anatomic lesion responsible for ""osteonecrosis-like syndrome of the medial tibial plateau"". Our magnetic resonance findings were similar to those seen in stress fractures at other sites.",0

There have been a few treatments that have been proposed: fixation of the fragment, drilling, microfractures. The aim of this study was to analyze retrospectively clinical and imaging results obtained by treating it with one-step bone marrow-derived cells Transplantation (BMDCT) technique.From 2007 to 2014, 18 patients (mean-age 19.1 ± 5.0 years) affected by OCD were treated with one-step BMDC transplantation. In our observational study, clinical evaluation was performed at a scheduled follow-up through IKDC, Tegner, KOOS and EQ-VAS. X-rays and MRI were conducted preoperatively and at 12 months. At final follow-up, MRI MOCART Score was evaluated.IKDC and KOOS clinical scores showed a progressive increase. Tegner Score at final follow-up (5.3 ± 2.7) was significantly lower compared to the pre-injury level (6.5 ± 2.1); however, these results showed a statistically significant improvement that remained over time.

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) may be performed after failed microfracture surgery. Alterations to subchondral bone as intralesional osteophytes are commonly seen after previous microfracture and removed during ACI. There have been no reports on potential recurrence. Our purpose was to evaluate the incidence of intralesional osteophyte development in 2 cohorts: existing intralesional osteophytes and without intralesional osteophytes at the time of ACI. Study Design We identified 87 patients (157 lesions) with intralesional osteophytes among a cohort of 497 ACI patients. Osteophyte regrowth was analyzed on magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as small or large (less or more than 50% of the cartilage thickness). Twenty patients (24 defects) without intralesional osteophytes at the time of ACI acted as control. Results Osteophyte regrowth was observed in 39.5% of lesions (34.4% of small osteophytes and 5.1% of large osteophytes). In subgroup analyses, regrowth was observed in 45.8% of periosteal-covered defects and in 18.9% of collagen membrane–covered defects. Large osteophyte regrowth occurred in less than 5% in either group. Periosteal defects showed a significantly higher incidence for regrowth of small osteophytes. In the control group, intralesional osteophytes developed in 16.7% of the lesions. Conclusions Even though intralesional osteophytes may regrow after removal during ACI, most of them are small. Small osteophyte regrowth occurs almost twice in periosteum-covered ACI. Large osteophytes occur only in 5% of patients. Intralesional osteophyte formation is not significantly different in preexisting intralesional osteophytes and control groups.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546511423522,Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation for Treatment of Cartilage Defects of the Knee,"Background: Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a well-established treatment option for isolated cartilage defects of the knee joint, providing satisfying outcome. However, cases of treatment failure with the need for surgical reintervention are reported; typical patient’s individual and environmental risk factors have previously not been described. Hypothesis: The need for reintervention after ACI is associated with specific preoperative detectable individual risk factors. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 413 patients following ACI (first, second, and third generation) were filtered for those who required revision surgery during their follow-up time (2-11.8 years). Factors were analyzed that might have significant effects on increased revision rate. Using preoperatively collected data, all patients were grouped according to 12 standard prognostic factors. Apart from odds ratio and Pearson χ 2 test, statistical analysis of risk factors was performed with multivariate binary logistic regression models and Cox regression, the method of choice for survival time data. Results: After a follow-up of 4.4 ± 0.9 years (limited to 5 years), a total of 88 patients (21.3%) had undergone surgical revision. The time to revision surgery was 1.8 ± 1.1 years. Four prognostic factors associated with a significantly higher risk for reintervention were detected: (1) female gender (Cox survival fit: P = .033), (2) previous surgeries of the affected joint ( P = .002), (3) previous bone marrow stimulation ( P = .041), and (4) periosteum patch–covered ACI ( P = .028). An influence of patient age, body mass index (BMI), defect number, defect size, lesion origin, lesion location, parallel treatment, or smoking on the risk for reintervention could not be observed. Conclusion: The study identifies clear facts that significantly increase the risk of revision surgery. These facts can be easily obtained preoperatively and may be taken into consideration when indicating ACI.",0

According to published studies, cartilage repair with scaffold augmentation has improved clinical outcomes, radiological fill, and histological repair compared with microfracture alone. Injectable scaffolds have the versatility to be used in large and irregularly shaped lesions. With correct preparation, they can be applied to lesions on the femoral condyle that may be vertical, or even inverted lesions such as those in the patella. They can be combined with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) to provide mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), thereby avoiding the need for microfracture. This protects the subchondral plate, preventing biomechanical alteration and potentially resulting in improved long-term outcomes. In this article, we demonstrate the utility of injectable scaffolds and their combination with BMAC.",0

Regenerative surgical options, aiming to stimulate natural cartilage healing, have been recently used as a first line treatment. In this study, a new hydrogel is investigated in its capacity to regenerate the ultra-structural quality of hyaline cartilage when combined with a classical microfracture technique.Forty-six patients, affected by grade III and IV knee chondropathies, were consecutively treated between 2013 and 2015 with microfractures followed by application of a modern hydrogel in the lesion site. All patients underwent clinical evaluation (WOMAC) pre-operatively, at 6,12 and at 24 months postoperatively: the results were compared with a subsequent, consecutive, matched, control group of 23 patients treated with microfractures alone. In a parallel and separate in-vitro histological study, adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) were encapsulated in the hydrogel scaffold, induced to differentiation into chondrocytes, and observed for a 3 weeks period.The initial WOMAC score of 58.6 ± 11.0 in the study group was reduced by 88% at 6 months (7.1 ± 9.2) and 95% at 24 months (2.9 ± 5.9). The ""in-vitro"" study revealed a histological characterization typical of hyaline cartilage in study group. Separate biopsies performed at 12 months post-op in the study group also revealed type 2 collagen and hyaline-like cartilage in the regenerated tissue.Our study demonstrated high patient satisfaction rates after microfractures combined with a modern hydrogel scaffold; histologic evaluation supported the hypothesis of creating an enhanced chondrogenic environment. Microfracture ""augmentation"" using modern acellular biomaterials, like hydrogels, might improve the clinical outcomes of this classical bone marrow stimulating procedure.",0

The outcome of a prospective cohort study of 18 patients with large trochlea lesions or isolated OA treated with the HemiCAP-WaveA (R) implant is presented with up to a 6-year survival rate, and hypothesised short-to mid-term reduced pain and improved function. Indication for treatment with the HemiCAP-WaveA (R) implant was a symptomatic, large cartilage lesion in trochlea demonstrated by MRI or arthroscopy, which was ICRS grades 3-4 and larger than 4 cm(2). Patients were followed for 2 years with American Knee Society Subjective outcome Scores (AKSS), pain scores and radiographic evaluations and for up to 6 years with complications and reoperations. At the 1- and 2-year follow-up mean AKSS clinical score, the mean AKSS function score and mean pain score improved significantly. Within 6 years, 28 % of the implants were revised to arthroplasty due to the progression of cartilage lesions, osteoarthritis or increased knee pain. The present study demonstrated an improved short- to mid-term clinical outcome and reduced pain but high mid-term revision rate after patellofemoral inlay resurfacing using the HemiCAP-WaveA (R) implant. Patellofemoral resurfacing implantation treatment with a large inlay prosthesis can offer temporary treatment for large isolated patellofemoral cartilage lesions or OA in younger patients with almost healthy cartilage in the other compartments who are not yet eligible for arthroplasty treatment.

Purpose To analyze and assess the quality of clinical studies on different products in the emerging field of matrix-assisted auto-logous chondrocyte transplantation. The secondary purpose of this review was to improve the quality assessment of studies by modifying the Coleman methodology score (CMS). Study Design Systematic review. Methods For this review, a literature search was performed to identify all published and unpublished clinical studies of matrixassisted (second-generation) autologous chondrocyte transplantation using the following medical electronic databases: MED-LINE, MEDLINE preprints, EMBASE, CINAHL, Life Science Citations, and British National Library of Health, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The search period was January 1, 1995, to July 1, 2008. To better assess cartilage-related studies, a modification of the CMS was proposed. Results Eighteen studies were included in the analysis, reporting on 731 patients with an average follow-up of 27.3 months (6.5-60.0 months). Of the 18 studies, 2 were randomized controlled studies, 3 were prospective comparative studies, 11 were prospective cohort studies or prospective case series, and 2 were retrospective case series. Original CMSs for these studies (55.1 6 1.6) were significantly higher than those of cartilage repair studies in general (43.5 6 1.6, P &lt;.0001) reported in 2005. The statistical analysis indicated that the modified CMS showed higher correlations and lower variability of correlations among 3 reviewers. Conclusion The quality of the currently available data on second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplantation is still limited by study designs. The modified CMS has demonstrated better sensitivity and reproducibility with respect to the original score, so it can be recommended for cartilage clinical studies evaluation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-017-4805-2,No implant migration and good subjective outcome of a novel customized femoral resurfacing metal implant for focal chondral lesions,"Managing focal cartilage injuries in the middle-aged patient poses a challenge. Focal prosthetic inlay resurfacing has been proposed to be a bridge between biologics and conventional joint arthroplasty. Patient selection and accurate implant positioning is crucial to avoid increased contact pressure to the opposite cartilage surface. A customized femoral condyle implant for focal cartilage injuries was designed to precisely fit each patient's individual size and location of damage. The primary objective was to assess implant safety profile, surgical usability of the implant and instruments, and implant migration with radiostereometric analysis (RSA).Ten patients 36-56 years with focal chondral defects, ICRS 3-4 of the femoral cartilage and failed earlier conservative or surgical interventions with VAS pain > 40. The patients were followed for 2 years with subjective outcome measures (VAS, EQ5D, KOOS) and RSA. The customized implant and guide instruments were manufactured by computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques using MRI data.VAS, EQ5D and KOOS showed improvements that reached significance for VAS (p ≤ 0.001), Tegner (p = 0.034) and the KOOS subscores ADL (p = 0.0048), sport and recreation (p = 0.034) and quality of life (p = 0.037). VAS and KOOS scores improved gradually at 3, 6 and 12 months. The improvements in EQ5D, KOOS pain and KOOS symptoms did not reach statistical significance. No infections, deep venous thrombosis or other complications occured in the postoperative period. No radiographic signs of damage to the opposing tibial cartilage was noted. The surgical usability of implants and instruments were good. RSA did not show any implant migration.This is the first clinical report of a new customized, focal knee resurfacing system. The short-term implant safety and patient-related outcome measures showed good-to-excellent results.Prospective case series, Level 4.",0

The BMP-4 and chondrogenesis markers were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thirty rabbits (60 knees) with full-thickness cylinder articular cartilage defects (diameter, 4.5 mm; depth, 0.8 mm) on the femoral trochlea were divided into a group in which the BMP-4--transfected ADSCs were seeded onto PLLGA scaffold and implanted into the defects (group ABNP), a group with untransfected ADSCs seeded onto scaffold (group ABP), and a group with a scaffold without cells (group P). Outcomes were evaluated by histology, Rudert score, Pineda score, and scanning electronic microscopy by 2 blinded observers at weeks 6 and 12 postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed with analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The statistical significance level was set at P < .05.The expression of chondrogenesis-related genes and proteins was significantly increased in BMP-4--transfected ADSCs in vitro (P < .05). The cell viability was 79.86% ± 5.04% after 24 hours. The transfection efficiency was 25.86% ± 4.27% after 72 hours. Defects in group ABNP showed the best in vivo cartilage regeneration. At week 12, the Rudert scores in group ABNP (7.00 ± 1.75) were better than those in group ABP (6.00 ± 2.00) or group P (5.00 ± 1.75) (P < .05), as were the Pineda scores (2.50 ± 3.00, 5.00 ± 2.00, and 6.00 ± 1.75, respectively; P < .001).BMP-4 plasmid can be successfully delivered into ADSCs by PLGA nanoparticles and promoted in vitro chondrogenesis. When compared with the control cells, BMP-4--transfected ADSCs seeded onto PLLGA scaffold significantly improve in vivo chondrogenesis in a rabbit articular defect model.PLGA nanoparticles and BMP-4 have potential for gene therapy in the treatment of chondral defects of the knee.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1655-1,Osteochondral tissue engineering approaches for articular cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration,"Osteochondral defects (i.e., defects which affect both the articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone) are often associated with mechanical instability of the joint and therefore with the risk of inducing osteoarthritic degenerative changes. This review addresses the current surgical treatments and most promising tissue engineering approaches for articular cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration. The capability to repair osteochondral or bone defects remains a challenging goal for surgeons and researchers. So far, most clinical approaches have been shown to have limited capacity to treat severe lesions. Current surgical repair strategies vary according to the nature and size of the lesion and the preference of the operating surgeon. Tissue engineering has emerged as a promising alternative strategy that essentially develops viable substitutes capable of repairing or regenerating the functions of damaged tissue. An overview of novel and most promising osteochondroconductive scaffolds, osteochondroinductive signals, osteochondrogenic precursor cells, and scaffold fixation approaches are presented addressing advantages, drawbacks, and future prospectives for osteochondral regenerative medicine. Tissue engineering has emerged as an excellent approach for the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue, with the potential to circumvent all the limitations of autologous and allogeneic tissue repair.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2012.05.024,Mesenchymal stem cell sheet encapsulated cartilage debris provides great potential for cartilage defects repair in osteoarthritis,"The restoration of the degenerated articular cartilage in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) is still a challenge for researchers and clinicians. Drug interventions and surgical treatments have been widely attempted for cartilage regeneration in OA. However, the results were largely unsatisfactory. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) offers potential for the regeneration of cartilage over the long-term. However, due to the limitations and disadvantages of ACI, alternative therapies for cartilage regeneration are in need. The availability of large quantities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the multilineage differentiation, especially their chondrogenic differentiation property, have made MSCs the most promising cell source for cartilage regeneration. In addition, MSCs have been shown the ability to undergo site-specific differentiation. MSCs can be obtained as MSC sheets using the temperature-responsive culture dish method. The MSC sheet can provide amounts of cells and extracellular matrix, which might provide the continuity between the implant and host cartilage, thus improving integrative cartilage repair. Moreover, OA is associated with progressive and often severe inflammation. MSCs not only have the ability to contribute structurally to tissue repair, but also possess potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Taken together, these properties make MSC sheet promising candidate for cartilage repair in OA. We hypothesize that MSC sheet encapsulated cartilage debris can efficiently promote cartilage repair in OA patients. Chondrocytes can be obtained and cultured from small cartilage debris in vitro. Therefore, the chondrocytes may grow from the debris in cartilage defect and improve cartilage regeneration. MSC sheet provide amounts of cells, ECM and protein for cartilage regeneration and integration, and may play some roles of periosteum. The operation of MSC sheet encapsulated cartilage debris for cartilage repair is simple and practical. Moreover, the cell sheet/cartilage debris constructs can be easily shaped based on the size and shape of cartilage defects. The new method might have great potential in treating cartilage defects clinically, especially for OA patients.",0

This design would allow for secure implant fixation, subsequent integration and remodeling. Materials and Methods Adult sheep were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 8/group): 1. trabecular metal/periosteal graft (TMPG), 2. trabecular metal (TM), 3. empty defect (ED). Cartilage and bone healing were assessed macroscopically, biochemically (type II collagen, sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) content) and histologically. Results At 16 weeks post-operatively, histological scores amongst treatment groups were not statistically different (TMPG: overall 12.7, cartilage 8.6, bone 4.1; TM: overall 14.2, cartilage 9.5, bone 4.9; ED: overall 13.6, cartilage 9.1, bone 4.5). Metal scaffolds were incorporated into the surrounding bone, both in TM and TMPG. The sGAG yield was lower in the neo-cartilage regions compared with the articular cartilage (AC) controls (TMPG 20.8/AC 39.5, TM 25.6/AC 33.3, ED 32.2/AC 40.2 µg sGAG/1 mg respectively), with statistical significance being achieved for the TMPG group (p &lt; 0.05). Hypercellularity of the neo-cartilage was found in TM and ED, as the dsDNA content was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) compared with contralateral AC controls (TM 126.7/AC 71.1, ED 99.3/AC 62.8 ng dsDNA/1 mg). The highest type II collagen content was found in neo-cartilage after TM compared with TMPG and ED (TM 60%/TMPG 40%/ED 39%). Inter-treatment differences were not significant. Conclusions TM is a highly suitable material for the reconstitution of osseous defects. TM enables excellent bony ingrowth and fast integration. However, combined with autologous periosteum, such a biocomposite failed to promote satisfactory neo-cartilage formation. Cite this article: E. H. Mrosek, H-W. Chung, J. S. Fitzsimmons, S. W.

https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603518756985,In Vitro Analysis of Cartilage Regeneration Using a Collagen Type I Hydrogel (CaReS) in the Bovine Cartilage Punch Model,"Limitations of matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation to regenerate functional hyaline cartilage demand a better understanding of the underlying cellular/molecular processes. Thus, the regenerative capacity of a clinically approved hydrogel collagen type I implant was tested in a standardized bovine cartilage punch model.Cartilage rings (outer diameter 6 mm; inner defect diameter 2 mm) were prepared from the bovine trochlear groove. Collagen implants (± bovine chondrocytes) were placed inside the cartilage rings and cultured up to 12 weeks. Cartilage-implant constructs were analyzed by histology (hematoxylin/eosin; safranin O), immunohistology (aggrecan, collagens 1 and 2), and for protein content, RNA expression, and implant push-out force.Cartilage-implant constructs revealed vital morphology, preserved matrix integrity throughout culture, progressive, but slight proteoglycan loss from the ""host"" cartilage or its surface and decreasing proteoglycan release into the culture supernatant. In contrast, collagen 2 and 1 content of cartilage and cartilage-implant interface was approximately constant over time. Cell-free and cell-loaded implants showed (1) cell migration onto/into the implant, (2) progressive deposition of aggrecan and constant levels of collagens 1 and 2, (3) progressively increased mRNA levels for aggrecan and collagen 2, and (4) significantly augmented push-out forces over time. Cell-loaded implants displayed a significantly earlier and more long-lasting deposition of aggrecan, as well as tendentially higher push-out forces.Preserved tissue integrity and progressively increasing cartilage differentiation and push-out forces for up to 12 weeks of cultivation suggest initial cartilage regeneration and lateral bonding of the implant in this in vitro model for cartilage replacement materials.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.otsr.2011.04.001,Chondral repair of the knee joint using mosaicplasty,"Mosaicplasty grafting is performed by transferring one or more cylindral osteochondral autografts from a low weight-bearing area of the knee towards the defective site, usually the femoral condyle. Numerous biomechanical, histological, animal and clinical studies have evaluated the different technical aspects of this procedure. The preoperative work-up encompasses an evaluation of functional disturbances, alignment, knee stability and imaging (CT arthrography or MRI with cartilage sequences). The surgical procedure includes harvesting the grafts by mini-arthrotomy of the medial or lateral trochlea and a stage for arthroscopic graft insertion. The ICRS classification is used to describe the defect (area, depth, location) before and then after debridement. A few, large diameter grafts are harvested from the trochlea across from the defect. The graft plugs are transplanted by press-fit, flush with the cartilage, along a convergent plane in recipient sockets of exactly the same depth. Each stage, harvesting, drilling and insertion is repeated until all the full-thickness gap region has been covered. Postoperative movement is free but weight-bearing is delayed for 2 to 4 weeks. Mosaicplasty is indicated in young patients (under 50), with symptomatic chondral or osteochondral defects of less than 3 cm in the weight-bearing part of the femoral condyle. Pre-osteoarthritis is an absolute contraindictation for this procedure. Any misalignment (of more than 5°) or sagittal instability is treated simultaneously. This is a difficult and demanding procedure.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.17.01418,Clinical and MRI Outcomes of Fresh Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation After Failed Cartilage Repair Surgery in the Knee,"Fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation is an appealing option to address a failed cartilage repair surgical procedure, given the ability to treat large lesions and to address the subchondral osseous changes commonly seen in the revision setting. We hypothesized that osteochondral allograft transplantation after failed cartilage repair would result in low failure rates and improved function and that improved graft incorporation on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would correlate with a superior clinical outcome.A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was used to identify 43 patients treated with fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation after a previous cartilage repair surgical procedure and having a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Score, Marx Activity Scale, Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living (KOS-ADL) Questionnaire, Cincinnati Sports Activity Score, and Cincinnati Overall Symptom Assessment. Postoperative MRI scans were obtained at a mean time of 19.7 months and were independently reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist using the Osteochondral Allograft MRI Scoring System (OCAMRISS).At a mean 3.5-year follow-up after osteochondral allograft transplantation, significant improvements (p < 0.05) in SF-36 Physical Function, SF-36 Pain, KOS-ADL, IKDC Subjective Knee Score, and Cincinnati Overall Symptom Assessment were seen. Over 90% of grafts remained in situ at the time of the latest follow-up, although 17 knees (40%) underwent reoperation, the majority for arthroscopic debridement or manipulation for stiffness. Body mass index (BMI) of >30 kg/m was associated with worse clinical outcomes. The mean total OCAMRISS score demonstrated poorer allograft integration in patients with graft failure, but the total score did not meaningfully correlate with clinical outcome scores. However, better individual articular cartilage appearance and osseous integration subscores were associated with better clinical outcome scores.Significant improvements in pain and function were seen following fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation after failed cartilage repair, with an overall graft survival rate of >90%. Patients with greater bone and cartilage incorporation on MRI had superior clinical outcomes, although persistent osseous edema was frequently seen. We concluded that osteochondral allograft transplantation is an effective salvage treatment after failed cartilage repair and recommend further evaluation of techniques to optimize graft integration.Therapeutic Level IV.

https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.k.00815,Activity Levels Are Higher After Osteochondral Autograft Transfer Mosaicplasty Than After Microfracture for Articular Cartilage Defects of the Knee,"There is limited information regarding direct comparisons of the outcome of osteochondral autograft transfer (OAT) mosaicplasty and microfracture for the treatment of isolated articular cartilage defects of the knee. The purpose of this retrospective comparative study was to compare the general health outcomes, knee function, and Marx Activity Rating Scale scores for patients treated with OAT or microfracture for symptomatic chondral defects of the femoral condyles or trochlea. We hypothesized that the patients in the two treatment groups would have similar clinical outcomes at intermediate-term follow-up.Ninety-six patients with full-thickness cartilage defects of the femoral condyles or trochlea were treated with either OAT mosaicplasty (n = 48) or microfracture (n = 48). The average age of the patients (thirty-two male and sixteen female in each group) at the time of surgery was 29.7 years in the OAT group and 32.5 years in the microfracture group. Patients were prospectively evaluated at baseline and at one, two, three, and five years postoperatively with use of validated clinical outcome measures including the Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Outcome Survey activities of daily living, and Marx Activity Rating Scale instruments. Comparisons between outcomes before and after treatment or between outcomes after microfracture and mosaicplasty were made with use of two-tailed tests.At the time of the latest follow-up, both groups demonstrated significant increases in SF-36 physical component, Knee Outcome Survey activities of daily living, and IKDC scores compared with baseline. These scores did not differ significantly between the two groups at any of the follow-up time points. However, the OAT group demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in the Marx Activity Rating Scale scores from baseline to the two-year (p = 0.001), three-year (p = 0.03), and five-year (p = 0.02) time points compared with the microfracture group.In the present retrospective comparative study, the hypothesis that patients treated with microfracture or OAT mosaicplasty for symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyles or trochlea would have similar clinical outcomes at intermediate-term follow-up was affirmed for general health outcome and for knee function. However, patients treated with OAT mosaicplasty maintained a superior level of athletic activity compared with those treated with microfracture.",0

Results for patellofemoral chondral defects have been less favorable. Hypothesis: Autologous chondrocyte implantation with characterized chondrocytes will result in clinically relevant improvement in patellofemoral lesions. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients with symptomatic patellofemoral full-thickness cartilage lesions were treated with ACI using characterized chondrocytes (ChondroCelect) covered with a collagen type I membrane. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Responders were defined using 5 categories (≥10 points and ≥20%, 30%, 50%, 70%) based on the KOOS and VAS. Treatment failure was defined as partial loosening of more than 20% of the graft with subsequent procedures to the subchondral bone. Results: Thirty-eight patients, with a mean defect size of 4.89 cm 2 (range, 1.5-11 cm 2 ), were treated for a patellar defect (n = 28), trochlear defect (n = 7), or a kissing lesion (trochlea and patella; n = 3). The minimum follow-up period was 24 months (mean, 37 months; range, 24-72 months). Treated patients showed statistically significant improvements in the KOOS (at 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months) and VAS (at the same time points) compared with pretreatment for each time point. Responder analysis identified approximately 84% of patients with a clinically relevant improvement greater than 10 points at 3 years. Treatment failure was observed in 5 patients. The most commonly reported adverse events were joint crepitation (n = 18) and arthrofibrosis (n = 7). No relationship could be found between clinical outcome and anatomic characteristics of the patellofemoral joint, lesion size and site, time since onset, or age. Nine patients required additional surgery: 6 because of persistent symptoms and 3 for hardware removal. Conclusion: Characterized chondrocyte implantation resulted in statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement over time. These results add to the evidence demonstrating that ACI is a valuable cartilage repair technique for patellofemoral lesions.",0

There were two objectives to this study: evaluate the functional results of surgical treatment by mosaicplasty in this disease as well as evaluate articular surface reconstruction and cylindrical bone plugs incorporation.Six consecutive cases of patella osteochondritis dissecans in young athletes were treated using mosaicplasty by the same senior surgeon between 2002 and 2007. All these cases presented ICRS stage IV osteochondritis dissecans with an empty defect lesion. The average age at diagnosis was 20.5 ± 9.2 years old. The pre- and post-operative clinical evaluation was based on the IKDC subjective knee evaluation, the Lysholm and Tegner scores, CT arthrography and MRI.Evaluation of the functional results of surgical treatment at a mean follow-up of 26 months showed an average IKDC subjective evaluation score of 66.3, a Lysholm score of 85 and a Tegner score of 5.7 (37.2, 58.3 and 3.5 respectively before surgery). The radiological evaluation showed articular surface reconstruction with satisfying congruency and good incorporation of the graft into the bone at the receptor site, except in one patient in whom a 5mm diameter cartilage defect and a loose body were identified.Osteochondral grafting with the mosaicplasty technique has been shown to be effective and give satisfying functional results. The problem of the per-operative cylindrical bone plugs choice requires to be addressed during the procedure course itself, according to the patella lesion location.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2019.12.020,"Editorial Commentary: Biological Cartilage Repair Technique—An “Effective, Accessible, and Safe” Surgical Solution for an Old Difficult Biological Problem","Achieving good long-term outcomes while treating chondral defects has always been a challenge. Several surgical techniques for regeneration of the articular cartilage have been proposed. Among them, osteochondral autograft transplantation and 2-step procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation have provided good results, promoting formation of new hyaline-like cartilage tissue, whereas other techniques such as microfracture result in fibrous cartilage and a less durable repair. Single-stage cell-based procedures are an attractive treatment option given the potential for cost savings and avoiding a second-stage procedure. We believe that 1-stage cartilage repair in the knee with a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold embedded with mesenchymal stem cells sourced from bone marrow aspirate concentrate has a prominent role in treating chondral defects because this is a simple technique that could improve the care of patients and be cost-effective in the near future.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/157488811797904371,Safety and Complications Reporting Update on the Re-Implantation of Culture-Expanded Mesenchymal Stem Cells Using Autologous Platelet Lysate Technique,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Numerous animal studies have documented the multipotency of MSCs, showing their capabilities for differentiating into orthopedic tissues such as muscle, bone, cartilage, and tendon. However, the safety of culture expanded MSCs for human use has only just begun to be reported. Methods: Between 2006 and 2010, two groups of patients were treated for various orthopedic conditions with cultureexpanded, autologous, bone marrow-derived MSCs (group 1: n=50; group 2: n=290-one patient in both groups). Cells were cultured in monolayer culture flasks using an autologous platelet lysate technique and re-injected into peripheral joints or into intervertebral discs with use of c-arm fluoroscopy. While both groups had prospective surveillance for complications, Group 1 additionally underwent 3.0T MRI tracking of the re-implant sites. Results: The mean age of patients treated was 53 +/- 13.85 years; 214 were males and 125 females with mean follow-up time from any procedure being 435 days +/- 261 days. Number of contacts initiated based on time from first procedure was 482 at 3 months, 433 at 6 months, 316 contacts at 12 months, 110 contacts at 24 months, and 22 contacts at 36 months. For Group 1, 50 patients underwent 210 MRI surveillance procedures at 3 months, 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years which failed to demonstrate any tumor formation at the re-implant sites. Formal disease surveillance for adverse events based on HHS criteria documented significantly less morbidity than is commonly reported for more invasive surgical procedures, all of which were either self-limited or were remedied with therapeutic measures. Two patients were diagnosed with cancer out of 339 patients treated since study inception; however, this was almost certainly unrelated to the MSC therapy and the neoplasm rate in similar to that seen in the U.S. Caucasian population. Knee outcome data was collected on a subset of patients. Here, > 75% improvement was reported in 41.4% while decreasing the improvement threshold to > 50% improvement, 63.2% reported an improvement. At an average reporting time of 11.3 months from first procedure average reported relief in the knee sample equaled 53.1% (n=133 reporting). Conclusions: Using both intensive high field MRI tracking and complications surveillance in 339 patients, no neoplastic complications were detected at any stem cell re-implantation site. These findings are consistent with our prior publication and other published reports that also show no evidence of malignant transformation in vivo, following implantation of MSCs for orthopedic use.",0

Design Full-thickness cylindrical defects were created in the medial femoral condyle in 9 New Zealand White rabbits (5 months old, 4.65 ± 0.20 kg). Two groups of rabbits ( n = 3) were either treated with ADSCs (Group 1) or the microfracture technique (Group 2) following intraarticular injection of PRP 3 times in weekly intervals. Rabbits in control group ( n = 3) remained untreated. The outcome was assessed macroscopically, histologically, and immunohistochemically. Results At the end of week 12, Group 1 showed better defect filling compared with Group 2. Specimens treated with the combination of ADSCs and PRP exhibited significant differences from the other groups in all criteria of International Cartilage Repair Society macroscopic scoring system. Conclusions Intraarticular injection of autologous PRP in combination with transplantation of autologous ADSCs by local adherent technique enhances the quality of cartilage defect repair with better results in comparison with microfracture surgery in a rabbit model.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546513518415,One-Step Repair for Cartilage Defects in a Rabbit Model,"Background: Cartilage repair still presents a challenge to clinicians and researchers alike. A more effective, simpler procedure that can produce hyaline-like cartilage is needed for articular cartilage repair. Hypothesis: A technique combining microfracture with a biomaterial scaffold of perforated decalcified cortical-cancellous bone matrix (DCCBM; composed of cortical and cancellous parts) would create a 1-step procedure for hyaline-like cartilage repair. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: For the in vitro portion of this study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from bone marrow aspirates of New Zealand White rabbits. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal microscopy, and 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue assay were used to assess the attachment, proliferation, and cartilage matrix production of MSCs grown on a DCCBM scaffold. For the in vivo experiment, full-thickness defects were produced in the articular cartilage of the trochlear groove of 45 New Zealand White rabbits, and the rabbits were then assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: perforated DCCBM combined with microfracture (DCCBM+M group), perforated DCCBM alone (DCCBM group), and microfracture alone (M group). Five rabbits in each group were sacrificed at 6, 12, or 24 weeks after the operation, and the repair tissues were analyzed by histological examination, assessment of matrix staining, SEM, and nanoindentation of biomechanical properties. Results: The DCCBM+M group showed hyaline-like articular cartilage repair, and the repair tissues appeared to have better matrix staining and revealed biomechanical properties close to those of the normal cartilage. Compared with the DCCBM+M group, there was unsatisfactory repair tissues with less matrix staining in the DCCBM group and no matrix staining in the M group, as well as poor integration with normal cartilage and poor biomechanical properties. Conclusion: The DCCBM scaffold is suitable for MSC growth and hyaline-like cartilage repair induction when combined with microfracture. Clinical Relevance: Microfracture combined with a DCCBM scaffold is a promising method that can be performed and adopted into clinical treatment for articular cartilage injuries.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2005.05.006,Autologous osteochondral transplantation for the treatment of chondral defects of the knee,"Full-thickness chondral defects of weight-bearing articular surfaces of the knee are a difficult condition to treat. Our aim is to evaluate the mid- and long-term functional outcome of the treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee with autologous osteochondral transplantation with the OATS technique. Thirty-six patients (37 procedures) were included in this study. Twenty-three patients were male and thirteen were female with a mean age of 31.9 years (range: 18-48 years). The cause of the defect was OCD in 10 cases, AVN in 2, lateral patellar maltracking in 7, while in the remaining 17 patients the defect was post-traumatic. The lesion was located on the femoral condyles in 26 cases and the patellofemoral joint in the remaining 11. The average area covered was 2.73 cm(2) (range: 0.8-12 cm(2)) and patients were followed for an average of 36.9 months (range: 18-73 months). The average score in their Tegner Activity Scale was 3.76 (range: 1-8), while their score in Activities of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey ranged from 18 to 98 with an average of 72.3. Thirty-two out of 37 patients (86.5%) reported improvement of their pre-operative symptoms. All but 5 patients returned to their previous occupation while 18 went back to sports. No correlation was found between patient age at operation, the size or site of the chondral lesion and the functional outcome. We believe that autologous osteochondral grafting with the OATS technique is a safe and successful treatment option for focal osteochondral defects of the knee. It offers a very satisfactory functional outcome and does not compromise the patient's future options.",0

Patients and Methods The study involved seven men and five women; their mean age was 35.9 years (14 to 70). All lesions included full-thickness articular cartilage extending through subchondral bone and were associated with subchondral cysts. Medial lesions were exposed through an oblique medial malleolar osteotomy, and one lateral lesion was exposed by expanding an anterolateral arthroscopic portal. After refreshing the subchondral cyst, it was grafted with autologous cancellous bone from the distal tibial metaphysis. The fragments of cartilage were fixed with 5-0 nylon sutures to the surrounding cartilage. Function was assessed at a mean follow-up of 25.3 months (15 to 50), using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot outcome score. The radiological outcome was assessed using MRI and CT scans. Results The mean AOFAS score improved from 65.7 (47 to 81) preoperatively to 92 (90 to 100) at final follow-up, with 100% patient satisfaction. The radiolucent area of the cysts almost disappeared on plain radiographs in all patients immediately after surgery, and there were no recurrences at the most recent follow-up. The medial malleolar screws were removed in seven patients, although none had symptoms. At this time, further arthroscopy was undertaken, when it was found that the mean International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) arthroscopic score represented near-normal cartilage. Conclusion Autologous bone grafting with fixation of chondral fragments preserves the original cartilage in the short term, and could be considered in the treatment for adult patients with symptomatic osteochondral defect and subchondral cysts.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00132-008-1215-7,Die autologe Knorpelzelltransplantation zur Behandlung von Knorpelläsionen am Talus,"In contrast to the knee joint, autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is rarely used for treating articular cartilage lesions in the ankle joint. Matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) with the use of biomaterials as cell carriers has facilitated operative application and fixation within the lesion. We have gained experience in the use of two different MACT techniques. According to the Hannover scoring system for the ankle and visual analog scores, results improved significantly (p \textbackslashtextless= 0.001) after MACT with the Hyalograft C in nine ankles at a mean follow-up of 3.7 years (range 2.6-4.8 years). All patients had undergone prior operative treatment for the cartilage lesion. Two patients were rated as excellent and seven as good. According to the ICRS cartilage repair assessment score, the transplanted areas were rated nearly normal (grade II) in seven patients who underwent undergone repeat arthroscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that in the majority of cases, filling of the defect was accomplished with a nonhomogeneous surface and structure of the graft. The use of a purely arthroscopically applicable three-dimensional MACT (ARTROcell 3D) with chondrospheres further facilitates the process and reduces operative morbidity. We have included eight patients in a prospective study so far. Six patients had undergone prior operative treatment for the cartilage lesion. In two cases, culturing of the cells failed for unexplained reasons; therefore, only six patients finally received the MACT with chondrospheres, and only four patients were evaluated at a 6-month follow-up examination. Thus, valid results cannot be reported. In revision cases, MACT is suggested to be a reliable alternative for treating articular cartilage lesions of the talus, but longer-term results in more patients remain to be evaluated.",0

Structural outcomes were assessed using quantitative 3-D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and morphological segmentation to determine the percentage of defect filling and repair cartilage T2 relaxation times, and clinical outcomes were determined with the modified Cincinnati Rating System, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Seventeen subjects with osteochondral defects in the knee were treated with ChondroMimetic scaffolds, from which 15 returned for long-term evaluation at a mean follow-up of 7.9 ± 0.3 years. The defects treated were trochlear donor sites for mosaicplasty in 13 subjects, and medial femoral condyle defects in 2 subjects. MRI analysis of scaffold-treated defects found a mean total defect filling of 95.2 ± 3.6%, and a tissue mean T2 relaxation time of 52.5 ± 4.8 ms, which was identical to the T2 of ipsilateral control cartilage (52.3 ± 9.2 ms). The overall modified Cincinnati Rating System score was statistically significant from baseline (p = 0.0065), and KOOS subscales were equivalent to other cartilage repair techniques. ChondroMimetic treatment resulted in a consistently high degree of osteochondral defect filling with durable, cartilage-like repair tissue at 7.9 years, potentially associated with clinical improvement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-06068-4,Promising radiological outcome after repair of acetabular chondral defects by microfracture augmented with chitosan-based scaffold: mid-term T2 mapping evaluation,"Purpose Radiological evaluation of the repair tissue produced after arthroscopic treatment of acetabular chondral lesions associated with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) by the chitosan-based scaffold. Methods Patients of age 18-55 years with clinical and radiological features of FAI and non-arthritic non-dysplastic hips were selected for arthroscopic treatment. Full-thickness acetabular chondral defects were filled with chitosan-based scaffold material after microfracture. T2 mapping was carried out for all patients after 24 months using a 1.5-T machine. Nine regions of interest (ROIs) were localized from three consecutive sagittal slices including the area of repair. T2 relaxation times of ROIs in the repair area were compared with the corresponding posterior cartilage. Results Twenty-one patients, 17 men and 4 women, underwent arthroscopic treatment of full-thickness acetabular chondral defects with mean size of 3.6 +/- 1 cm(2)(range 2-6 cm(2)). Zone 2 was affected in all cases while zone 3 was involved in 13 cases. T2 relaxation values were collected from 189 ROIs for quantitative analysis. Within the peripheral repair area, the mean T2 value was 49.1 +/- 7.2 ms (ms), while ROIs of the central repair area had mean T2 values of 50.2 +/- 7.1 ms. Posterior cartilage showed mean T2 value of 46.2 +/- 7.6 ms Conclusion Arthroscopic microfracture of large full-thickness acetabular chondral defects with chitosan-based scaffold produced a homogenous repair tissue similar to the corresponding native cartilage of the same joint on quantitative T2 mapping at mid-term follow-up. Clinical relevance: augmentation of the microfracture by chitosan-based scaffold is a promising modality for treatment of large full-thickness acetabular defects.",0

This study hypothesised that MACI is effective for up to 5 years and that patients with posttreatment problems may go on to obtain clinical benefit from other interventions. A follow-on, prospective case series of patients recruited into a previous controlled, randomised, prospective study or newly enroled. Patients were followed up 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after surgery. Outcome measures were Tegner (activity levels) and Lysholm (pain, stability, gait, clinical symptoms) scores. Zone-specific subgroups were analysed 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Sixty-five patients were treated with MACI. Median Tegner score improved from II to IV at 12 months; an improvement maintained to 60 months. Mean Lysholm score improved from 28.5 to 76.6 points (+/- 19.8) at 24 months, settling back to 75.5 points after 5 years (p \textbackslashtextgreater 0.0001). No significant differences were identified in the zone-specific analysis. Posttreatment issues (N = 12/18.5 %) were resolved with microfracture, debridement, OATS or bone grafting. MACI is safe and effective in the majority of patients. Patients in whom treatment is only partially successful can go on to obtain clinical benefit from other cartilage repair options. This study adds to the clinical evidence on the MACI procedure, offers insight into likely treatment outcomes, and highlights MACI's usefulness as part of an armamentarium of surgical approaches to the treatment of isolated knee defects.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546511420688,Articular Cartilage Treatment in High-Level Male Soccer Players,"Background: Soccer is a highly demanding sport for the knee joint, and chondral injuries can cause disabling symptoms that may jeopardize an athlete’s career. Articular cartilage lesions are difficult to treat, and the increased mechanical stress produced by this sport makes their management even more complex. Hypothesis: To evaluate whether the regenerative cell-based approach allows these highly demanding athletes a better functional recovery compared with the bone marrow stimulation approach. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Forty-one professional or semiprofessional male soccer players were treated from 2000 to 2006 and evaluated prospectively at 2 years and at a final 7.5-year mean follow-up (minimum, 4 years). Twenty-one patients were treated with arthroscopic second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (Hyalograft C) and 20 with the microfracture technique. The clinical outcome of all patients was analyzed using the cartilage standard International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) evaluation package. The sport activity level was evaluated with the Tegner score, and the recovery time was also recorded. Results: A significant improvement in all clinical scores from preoperative to final follow-up was found in both groups. The percentage of patients who returned to competition was similar: 80% in the microfracture group and 86% in the Hyalograft C group. Patients treated with microfracture needed a median of 8 months before playing their first official soccer game, whereas the Hyalograft C group required a median time of 12.5 months ( P = .009). The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score showed similar results at 2 years’ follow-up but significantly better results in the Hyalograft C group at the final evaluation ( P = .005). In fact, in the microfracture group, results decreased over time (from 86.8 ± 9.7 to 79.0 ± 11.6, P &lt; .0005), whereas the Hyalograft C group presented a more durable outcome with stable results (90.5 ± 12.8 at 2 years and 91.0 ± 13.9 at the final follow-up). Conclusion: Despite similar success in returning to competitive sport, microfracture allows a faster recovery but present a clinical deterioration over time, whereas arthroscopic second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation delays the return of high-level male soccer players to competition but can offer more durable clinical results.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.04.003,Healing of articular cartilage defects treated with a novel drug-releasing rod-type implant after microfracture surgery,"Microfracture therapy is a widely used technique for the repair of articular cartilage defects because it can be readily performed arthroscopically. However, the regenerated cartilage after microfracture surgery clearly differs from normal articular cartilage. This suggests that the clinical outcome of patients undergoing microfracture therapy could be improved. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is known to protect against articular cartilage loss. Therefore, in an effort to achieve cartilage regeneration of high efficacy, we manufactured a DHEA-S-releasing rod-type implant for implantation into the holes produced by microfracture surgery. The polymeric rod-type implant was made of biodegradable poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate to enable controlled release of DHEA-S. The implant was dip-coated with a dilute PLGA solution to prevent the burst release of DHEA-S. The rod-type implant was sufficiently stiff to permit implantation into the holes made by microfracture. DHEA-S was released from the implant for more than four weeks. Furthermore, eight weeks after implantation into rabbit knees, the implants dramatically enhanced cartilage regeneration compared to control. Moreover, the degradation of the implant over the eight weeks from implantation into the knee did not induce any adverse effects. Therefore, this polymeric rod-type implant does not only provide an improvement in microfracture surgery, but also has great potential as a new formulation for drug delivery.",0
https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2016-0023,Comparative Clinical Observation of Arthroscopic Microfracture in the Presence and Absence of a Stromal Vascular Fraction Injection for Osteoarthritis,"Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative cartilage disease that is characterized by a local inflammatory reaction. Consequently, many studies have been performed to identify suitable prevention and treatment interventions. In recent years, both arthroscopic microfracture (AM) and stem cell therapy have been used clinically to treat OA. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of AM in the presence and absence of a stromal vascular fraction (SVF) injection in the management of patients with OA. Thirty patients with grade 2 or 3 (Lawrence scale) OA of the knee participated in this study. Placebo group patients (n = 15) received AM alone; treatment group patients (n = 15) received AM and an adipose tissue-derived SVF injection. The SVF was suspended in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) before injection into the joint. Patient groups were monitored and scored with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Lysholm, Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), and modified Outerbridge classifications before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment. Bone marrow edema was also assessed at these time points. Patients were evaluated for knee activity (joint motion amplitude) and adverse effects relating to surgery and stem cell injection. Treatment efficacy was significantly different between placebo and treatment groups. All treatment group patients had significantly reduced pain and WOMAC scores, and increased Lysholm and VAS scores compared with the placebo group. These findings suggest that the SVF/PRP injection efficiently improved OA for 18 months after treatment. This study will be continuously monitored for additional 24 months.",1
https://doi.org/10.1038/nrrheum.2009.204,New methods to diagnose and treat cartilage degeneration,"Lesions in articular cartilage can result in significant musculoskeletal morbidity and display unique biomechanical characteristics that make repair difficult, at best. Several surgical procedures have been devised in an attempt to relieve pain, restore function, and delay or stop the progression of cartilaginous lesions. Advanced MRI and ultrasonography protocols are currently used in the evaluation of tissue repair and to improve diagnostic capability. Other nonoperative modalities, such as injection of intra-articular hyaluronic acid or supplementary oral glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, have shown potential efficacy as anti-inflammatory and symptom-modifying agents. The emerging field of tissue engineering, involving the use of a biocompatible, structurally and mechanically stable scaffold, has shown promising early results in cartilage tissue repair. Scaffolds incorporating specific cell sources and bioactive molecules have been the focus in this new exciting field. Further work is required to better understand the behavior of chondrocytes and the variables that influence their ability to heal articular lesions. The future of cartilage repair will probably involve a combination of treatments in an attempt to achieve a regenerative tissue that is both biomechanically stable and, ideally, identical to the surrounding native tissues.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-012-1920-y,One-step osteochondral repair with cartilage fragments in a composite scaffold,"Purpose This study proposes a single-step therapeutic approach for osteochondral defects using autologous cartilage fragments loaded onto a scaffold composed of a hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative, human fibrin glue (FG) and autologous platelet-rich-plasma (PRP), in a rabbit model. The aim is to demonstrate the in vitro outgrowth of chondrocytes from cartilage fragments and the in vivo formation of a functional repair tissue. Methods In vitro: minced articular cartilage was loaded onto two different types of scaffold (paste or membrane) according to two different HA preparations (injectable HA-derivative or HA-derivative felt). In vivo: trochlear osteochondral defects were created in 50 adult rabbits, which were then assigned to 5 different treatment groups: cartilage fragments loaded onto membrane scaffolds with FG (Group 1) or without FG (Group 2); membrane scaffolds alone with FG (Group 3) or without FG (Group 4); empty defects (Group 5). Membrane scaffolds were used “in vivo” for simpler preparation and better adhesive properties. Repair processes were evaluated histologically and by immunohistochemistry at 1, 3, and 6 months. Results An in vitro time-dependent cell outgrowth from cartilage fragments was observed with both types of scaffolds. At 6 months, in vivo, cartilage fragment-loaded scaffolds induced significantly better repair tissue than the scaffold alone using histological scoring. Repair in Group 2 was superior to that in any of the control groups (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Conclusion Autologous cartilage fragments loaded onto an HA felt/FG/PRP-scaffold provided an efficient cell source, and allowed for an improvement of the repair process of ostechondral defects in a rabbit model. Human FG, however, hampered the rabbit healing process. These results may have clinical relevance as they show the potential of a novel one-stage repair technique for osteochondral defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20092227,A Composite Chitosan-Reinforced Scaffold Fails to Provide Osteochondral Regeneration,"Several biomaterials have recently been developed to address the challenge of osteochondral regeneration. Among these, chitosan holds promises both for cartilage and bone healing. The aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the regeneration potential of a novel hybrid magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (MgHA), collagen, chitosan-based scaffold, which was tested in a sheep model to ascertain its osteochondral regenerative potential, and in a rabbit model to further evaluate its ability to regenerate bone tissue. Macroscopic, microtomography, histology, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. In the sheep model, all analyses did not show significant differences compared to untreated defects (p &gt; 0.05), with no evidence of cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration. In the rabbit model, this bone scaffold provided less ability to enhance tissue healing compared with a commercial bone scaffold. Moreover, persistence of scaffold material and absence of integration with connective tissue around the scaffolds were observed. These results raised some concerns about the osteochondral use of this chitosan composite scaffold, especially for the bone layer. Further studies are needed to explore the best formulation of chitosan-reinforced composites for osteochondral treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10856-013-4944-z,A silk fibroin/chitosan scaffold in combination with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to repair cartilage defects in the rabbit knee,"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were seeded in a three-dimensional scaffold of silk fibroin (SF) and chitosan (CS) to repair cartilage defects in the rabbit knee. Totally 54 rabbits were randomly assigned to BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold, SF/CS scaffold and control groups. A cylindrical defect was created at the patellofemoral facet of the right knee of each rabbit and repaired by scaffold respectively. Samples were prepared at 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-surgery for gross observation, hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining, type II collagen immunohistochemistry, Wakitani histology. The results showed that differentiated BMSCs proliferated well in the scaffold. In the BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold group, the bone defect was nearly repaired, the scaffold was absorbed and immunohistochemistry was positive. In the SF/CS scaffold alone group, fiber-like tissues were observed, the scaffold was nearly degraded and immunohistochemistry was weakly positive. In the control group, the defect was not well repaired and positive immunoreactions were not detected. Modified Wakitani scores were superior in the BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold group compared with those in other groups at 4, 8 and 12 weeks (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). A SF/CS scaffold can serve as carrier for stem cells to repair cartilage defects and may be used for cartilage tissue engineering.",0

These patients were prospectively clinically evaluated at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for morphologic analysis of the cartilage repair. Biopsy samples were taken from 3 cases during revision surgery, allowing histologic assessment of the repair tissue.The short-term clinical and MRI outcome of this pilot study are modest. No signs of deterioration of the repair tissue were observed. Of the 15 patients followed up during 1 year, 3 (20.0%) showed persistent clinical symptoms or even more clinical symptoms after insertion of the plug. These patients were considered as failures and therefore eligible for revision surgery. During revision surgery, the repair tissue was carefully removed. The remaining osteochondral defect was filled with autologous bone grafts. Immediate and persistent relief of symptoms was observed in all 3 patients. Histologic assessment of biopsy specimens taken during revision surgery showed fibrous vascularized repair tissue with the presence of foreign-body giant cells.The overall short-term clinical and MRI outcome of the osteochondral scaffold plug for cartilage repair in the knee is modest. In this pilot study a modest clinical improvement became apparent at 12 months of follow-up. MRI data showed no deterioration of the repair tissue. Of the 15 patients, 3 (20%) had persistent clinical symptoms after surgery. These patients were successfully treated with removal of the osteochondral plug remnants and the application of autologous bone grafts.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0

Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) may overcome this shortcoming by combining MFx with collagen scaffolds. However, the outcomes of AMIC and MFx in the knee have not been compared.To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of AMIC and MFx over a minimum 2-year follow-up.Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.A systematic search of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases identified studies of patients who underwent AMIC or MFx and that reported validated clinical outcome measure and/or radiological evaluation findings at a follow-up of ≥2 years. There were 2 reviewers who performed study selection, a risk of bias assessment, and data extraction.Overall, 29 studies were included in this systematic review. The mean improvement on the Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and visual analog scale for pain did not differ significantly between the 2 procedures. The mean improvement on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score was significantly greater in the AMIC (45.9 [95% CI, 36.2-55.5]) than in the MFx (27.2 [95% CI, 23.3-31.1]) group (P < .001). In addition, the mean magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue score was significantly higher in the AMIC (69.3 [95% CI, 55.1-83.5]) versus MFx (41.0 [95% CI, 27.3-54.7]) group (P = .005), and the mean adequate defect filling rate on magnetic resonance imaging scans was significantly better in the AMIC (77.3% [95% CI, 66.7%-87.9%]) versus MFx (47.9% [95% CI, 29.2%-66.6%]) group (P = .008) (odds ratio, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.07-2.33]).No significant differences in clinical outcomes, except for the IKDC subjective score, were found between the AMIC and MFx groups. Greater improvement in IKDC subjective scores and magnetic resonance imaging findings were seen in patients treated with AMIC compared with MFx at a minimum 2-year follow-up.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0129,Osteochondral Repair by a Novel Interconnecting Collagen–Hydroxyapatite Substitute: A Large-Animal Study,"A novel three-dimensional bicomponent substitute made of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite was tested for the repair of osteochondral lesions in a swine model. This scaffold was assembled by a newly developed method that guarantees the strict integration between the organic and the inorganic parts, mimicking the biological tissue between the chondral and the osseous phase. Thirty-six osteochondral lesions were created in the trochlea of six pigs; in each pig, two lesions were treated with scaffolds seeded with autologous chondrocytes (cell+group), two lesions were treated with unseeded scaffolds (cell− group), and the two remaining lesions were left untreated (untreated group). After 3 months, the animals were sacrificed and the newly formed tissue was analyzed to evaluate the degree of maturation. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic assessment showed significantly higher scores in the cell− and untreated groups when compared with the cell+ group. Histological evaluation showed the presence of repaired tissue, with fibroblast-like and hyaline-like areas in all groups; however, with respect to the other groups, the cell− group showed significantly higher values in the ICRS II histological scores for “cell morphology” and for the “surface/superficial assessment.” While the scaffold seeded with autologous chondrocytes promoted the formation of a reparative tissue with high cellularity but low glycosaminoglycans (GAG) production, on the contrary, the reparative tissue observed with the unseeded scaffold presented lower cellularity but higher and uniform GAG distribution. Finally, in the lesions treated with scaffolds, the immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of collagen type II in the peripheral part of the defect, indicating tissue maturation due to the migration of local cells from the surroundings. This study showed that the novel osteochondral scaffold was easy to handle for surgical implantation and was stable within the site of lesion; at the end of the experimental time, all implants were well integrated with the surrounding tissue and no signs of synovitis were observed. The quality of the reparative tissue seemed to be superior for the lesions treated with the unseeded scaffolds, indicating the promising potential of this novel biomaterial for use in a one-stage procedure for osteochondral repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546510381575,Arthroscopic Treatment of Osteochondral Lesions of the Ankle With Matrix-Associated Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Conventional autologous chondrocyte transplantation in the ankle often requires tibial or fibular osteotomies with potential morbidity for the patient. Advances in biotechnology and surgical techniques have resulted in the development of matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation (MACI). As the chondrocyte-loaded scaffold can be applied arthroscopically, this procedure is especially useful for the treatment of osteochondral defects in the ankle. Hypothesis: Arthroscopic MACI is a safe procedure in the ankle with good clinical and magnetic resonance imaging results. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: The authors reviewed all patients (n = 18) who had arthroscopic MACI for osteochondral lesions of the ankle (n = 19) between February 2006 and May 2008 clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging. The pain and disability module of the Foot Function Index (FFI), the American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) clinical rating system, the Core Scale of the Foot and Ankle Module of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Lower Limb Outcomes Assessment Instruments, and the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score were used. The clinical results up to 3 years after MACI (mean follow-up, 24.5 months) were compared with preoperative data for 14 cases and the magnetic resonance imaging data for all 19. Results: A significant improvement (50.3% ± 13.2%) in all clinical scores was noted (FFI pain before MACI: 5.5 ± 2.0, after MACI: 2.8 ± 2.2; FFI disability before MACI: 5.0 ± 2.3, after MACI: 2.6 ± 2.2; AOFAS before MACI: 58.6 ± 16.1, after MACI: 80.4 ± 14.1; AAOS standardized mean before MACI: 59.9 ± 16.0, after MACI: 83.5 ± 13.2; AAOS normative score before MACI: 23.0 ± 13.0, after MACI: 42.2 ± 10.7). According to the AOFAS Hindfoot score, 64% were rated as excellent and good, whereas 36% were rated fair and poor. The results correlated with the age of the patient and the duration of symptoms, but not with the size of the lesion. Sixteen patients (89%) reported regular sports activities before the onset of symptoms; 13 of them (81%) returned to sports after the MACI, 56% (n = 9) to the same level. The mean MOCART score was 62.4 ± 15.8 points. In general, there was no relation between MOCART score and clinical outcome, although the filling of the defect showed some correlation with the AAOS score. Conclusion: Arthroscopic MACI is a safe procedure for the treatment of osteochondral lesions in the ankle with overall good clinical and magnetic resonance imaging results.",0

Hypothesis The histologic and immunohistochemical appearance of the repair tissues in failed articular cartilage resurfacing procedures will be similar, regardless of the procedure that was done, and will not resemble normal articular cartilage. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Graft tissue from 10 patients who underwent an autologous chondrocyte implantation (n = 6), microfracture (n = 3), or periosteal transplantation (n = 1) procedure to treat symptomatic osteochondritis dissecans of the medial femoral condyle was processed for histologic examination after failure of the articular cartilage resurfacing procedure. Serial sections from all slabs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and toluidine blue and were immunostained using antibodies directed against types I, II, and X collagen. Results Specimens from all 3 types of repair procedures were composed primarily of fibrous connective tissue and fibrocartilage. None of the sections stained positively for type X collagen. All 10 cases stained positively for type I collagen (range, 7%–97% of tissue area). Staining for type II collagen was positive in 4 of 6 autologous chondrocyte implantation cases, 3 of 3 microfracture cases, and the periosteal transplant case (range, 2%–65% of tissue area). In 8 of 10 cases, the percentage of the section area exhibiting positive staining for type I collagen was higher than for type II collagen (6 of 6 autologous chondrocyte implantation; 1 of 3 microfracture; 1 periosteal transplant). Conclusion The histologic appearance of the repair tissue of 3 different failed articular cartilage resurfacing procedures was similar and did not resemble normal articular cartilage.",0

Patients were included if they had TP cartilage lesions treated with surgery. Lesion characteristics, surgical procedure details, patient reported outcomes, complication, and failure rates were collected.Thirteen studies yielded 205 knees with TP cartilage lesions treated surgically. Ages ranged from 12 to 77 years. Surgical techniques included 138 treated with osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA), 37 treated with osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS), 11 treated with microfracture, 11 treated with an osteochondral scaffold, and 8 treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The patient-reported outcome measures were heterogeneous, but all reported improvements with the notable exception of one study evaluating microfracture. The rate of complications ranged from 0% to 4.6%. Failure rate ranged from 22% to 46% for OCA and 0% to 16% for OATS. No failures were reported for the additional techniques.Various surgical techniques have been utilized for the treatment of TP cartilage lesions. Patient-reported outcome measures were heterogeneous, but improvements were reported following all surgical treatments except for microfracture, which resulted in decreased scores at mid-term follow-up. The complication rate was low for all techniques described. However, the failure rate was higher following unicondylar OCA for salvage treatment of posttraumatic deformities.",0

BioSeed-C is a second-generation ACI tissue engineering cartilage graft that is based on autologous chondrocytes embedded in a three-dimensional bioresorbable two-component gel-polymer scaffold. In the present prospective study, we evaluated the short-term to mid-term efficacy of BioSeed-C for the arthrotomic and arthroscopic treatment of posttraumatic and degenerative cartilage defects in a group of patients suffering from chronic posttraumatic and/or degenerative cartilage lesions of the knee. Clinical outcome was assessed in 40 patients with a 2-year clinical follow-up before implantation and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after implantation by using the modified Cincinnati Knee Rating System, the Lysholm score, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and the current health assessment form (SF-36) of the International Knee Documentation Committee, as well as histological analysis of second-look biopsies. Significant improvement (p < 0.05) in the evaluated scores was observed at 1 and/or 2 years after implantation of BioSeed-C, and histological staining of the biopsies showed good integration of the graft and formation of a cartilaginous repair tissue. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score showed significant improvement in the subclasses pain, other symptoms, and knee-related quality of life 2 years after implantation of BioSeed-C in focal osteoarthritic defects.

We have developed a biphasic cylindrical osteochondral construct for such use in human knees, and report the five year post-operative outcomes. Methods Ten patients with symptomatic osteochondral lesion at femoral condyles were treated by replacing pathological tissue with the osteochondral composites, each consisted a (DL)-poly-lactide-co-glycolide chondral phase and a (DL)-poly-lactide-co-glycolide/beta-tricalcium phosphate osseous phase. A flat chamber between the two phases served as a reservoir to house double-minced (mechanical pulverization and enzymatical dissociation) autologous cartilage graft. The osteochondral lesion was drill-fashioned a pit of identical dimensions as the construct. Graft-laden construct was press fit to the pit. Post-operative outcome was evaluated using Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) up to five years. Regenerated tissue was sampled with arthroscopic needle biopsy for histology at one year, and imaged with magnetic resonance at one, three, and five years to evaluate the neocartilage with MOCART chart. Subchondral bone integration was evaluated with computed tomography at three and five years. Results Nine patients completed the five-year follow-up. Post-operative mean KOOS, except that of the “symptom” subscale, had been significantly higher than pre-operation from one year and maintained to five years. The change of MOCRAT scores of the regenerated cartilage paralleled the change of KOOS. The osseous phase remained mineralized during the five-year period, yet did not fully integrate with the host bone. Conclusions This novel construct for chondrocyte implantation yielded promising mid-term outcome. It repaired the osteochondral lesion with hyaline-like cartilage durable for at least five years.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.563203,Peptide-Enriched Silk Fibroin Sponge and Trabecular Titanium Composites to Enhance Bone Ingrowth of Prosthetic Implants in an Ovine Model of Bone Gaps,"Osteoarthritis frequently requires arthroplasty. Cementless implants are widely used in clinics to replace damaged cartilage or missing bone tissue. In cementless arthroplasty, the risk of aseptic loosening strictly depends on implant stability and bone-implant interface, which are fundamental to guarantee the long-term success of the implant. Ameliorating the features of prosthetic materials, including their porosity and/or geometry, and identifying osteoconductive and/or osteoinductive coatings of implant surfaces are the main strategies to enhance the bone-implant contact surface area. Herein, the development of a novel composite consisting in the association of macro-porous trabecular titanium with silk fibroin (SF) sponges enriched with anionic fibroin-derived polypeptides is described. This composite is applied to improve early bone ingrowth into the implant mesh in a sheep model of bone defects. The composite enables to nucleate carbonated hydroxyapatite and accelerates the osteoblastic differentiation of resident cells, inducing an outward bone growth, a feature that can be particularly relevant when applying these implants in the case of poor osseointegration. Moreover, the osteoconductive properties of peptide-enriched SF sponges support an inward bone deposition from the native bone towards the implants. This technology can be exploited to improve the biological functionality of various prosthetic materials in terms of early bone fixation and prevention of aseptic loosening in prosthetic surgery.",0

The mean age at treatment was 21 ± 6 years. The average size of the defects was 3 ± 1cm(2). Patients were evaluated with IKDC, EQ-VAS, and Tegner scores.A statistically significant improvement in all scores was observed after the treatment. The IKDC subjective score improved from 38 ± 13 to 81 ± 20, and 91% of the knees were rated as normal or nearly normal in the objective IKDC at the final evaluation. EQ-VAS and Tegner scores showed a statistically significant linear trend of improvement over time passing from 52 ± 18 to 83 ± 14 and from 2 ± 1 to 5 ± 3, respectively, at 6 years' follow-up. A better outcome was obtained in men, sport active patients, and smaller lesions.Second generation ACI associated with bone grafting is a valid treatment option for knee OCD and may offer a good and stable clinical outcome at mean 6 years of follow-up. Further studies are needed to confirm the results over time, and determine if there is only a symptomatic improvement, or if this procedure may also prevent or delay further knee degeneration.",0

However, much less is known about third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation application in high-level athletes. We report on the two-year follow-up outcome after matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation to treat a large cartilage lesion of the lateral femoral condyle in a male Caucasian professional football player.Case presentationA 27-year-old male Caucasian professional football player was previously treated for cartilage problems of his left knee with two failed microfracture procedures resulting in a 9 cm2 Outerbridge Grade 4 chondral lesion at his lateral femoral condyle. Preoperative Tegner-Lysholm and Brittberg-Peterson scores were 64 and 58, and by the second year they were 91 and 6. An evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated filling of the defect with the signal intensity of the repair tissue resembling healthy cartilage. Second-look arthroscopy revealed robust, smooth cartilage covering his lateral femoral condyle. He returned to his former competitive level without restrictions or complaints one year after the procedure.ConclusionsThis case illustrates that robust cartilage tissue can be obtained with a matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure even after two failed microfracture procedures in a large (9 cm2) cartilage defect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the application of the third-generation cell therapy treatment technique, matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation, in a professional football player.",0
https://doi.org/10.2519/jospt.2014.5055,Clinical Rehabilitation Guidelines for Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation on the Tibiofemoral Joint,"Synopsis Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has become an established technique for the repair of full-thickness chondral defects in the knee. Matrix-induced ACI (MACI) is the third and current generation of this surgical technique, and, while postoperative rehabilitation following MACI aims to restore normal function in each patient as quickly as possible by facilitating a healing response without overloading the repair site, current published guidelines appear conservative, varied, potentially outdated, and often based on earlier ACI surgical techniques. This article reviews the existing evidence-based literature pertaining to cell loading and postoperative rehabilitation following generations of ACI. Based on this information, in combination with the technical benefits provided by third-generation MACI in comparison to its surgical predecessors, we present a rehabilitation protocol for patients undergoing MACI in the tibiofemoral joint that has now been implemented for several years by our institution in patients with MACI, with good clinical outcomes.

Our purpose is to report outcomes in a cohort of patients undergoing impaction bone grafting for treatment of knee OCD.Patients undergoing impaction bone grafting for knee OCD between 1998 and 2011 were contacted and stratified into (a) those who have undergone subsequent surgery on the affected knee and (b) those who have not had revision surgery performed on the affected knee since the impaction bone grafting procedure. For those not undergoing another procedure, physical examination, radiographs, MRI, and functional outcomes (SF12, Tegner, Activity Rating Scale, and IKDC) were obtained.Of nine patients (10 knees) undergoing the procedure, seven (eight knees) were available for follow-up. Three had revision surgery. One had debridement due to surface overgrowth and had no symptoms 43months following debridement, while two had osteochondral allograft and autograft procedures at three and 10years after initial surgery, respectively. Four patients did not require a revision surgical procedure at average follow-up of 55.4months (range, 21-116months). All had complete MRI fill of the cartilaginous defect with less than 50% of surface irregularity and redeveloped the tidemark and a heterogeneous cartilaginous surface. Follow-up Tegner, ARS, and SF12-PCS averaged 6.8, 67.5, and 56.6, respectively. All four had good/excellent IKDC results.Impaction bone grafting can reliably restore osteocartilaginous defect produced by OCD and is a readily available and less-expensive option in treating OCD lesions. Further investigation is necessary to determine the long-term durability of the results. Level IV - Case series.",0
,[New therapy procedure for localized cartilage defects. Encouraging results with autologous chondrocyte implantation].,"Owing to the poor regenerative capacity of cartilage, cartilaginous defects are considered to represent pre-arthrotic factors. In addition to autologous and allogenic osteochondral fragments, proliferative tissue, such as periosteum and perichondrium are increasingly being used as graft material. The aim of treatment is to eliminate the defect and to restore the load-bearing capacity and function of the affected joint. A new, recently introduced, approach aims to stimulate the formation of new cartilage via autologous cultured chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The rationale for this treatment is the restoration of loadable hyaline or hyaline-like articular cartilage. Although long-term results are not yet available, clinical follow-up data obtained so far are encouraging. In addition to existing methods of treating cartilaginous defects, this article describes a modified method of transplantation of autologous chondrocytes. With this method the periosteal flap used to cover a defect is replaced by an absorbable collagenl/III membrane (Chondrogide, Geistlich Wolhusen, Switzerland) that is used as a carrier for the patient's own chondrocytes. After placement in the defect, the membrane is fixed in place with fibrin glue (MACI).",0

Meanwhile, non-invasive imaging techniques were use to track SPIO-labeled MSCs by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Human bone marrow MSCs were cultured and labeled with SPIO. Fresh degenerated human osteochondral fragments were obtained during total knee arthroplasty and a cartilage defect was created at the center. Then, the osteochondral fragments were attached to the sidewalls of culture flasks filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to mimic the human joint cavity. The SPIO-labeled MSCs were injected into the culture flasks in the presence of a 0.57 Tesla (T) magnetic force. Before and 90 min after cell targeting, the specimens underwent T-2-weighted turbo spin-echo (SET2WI) sequence of 3.0 T MRI. MRI results were compared with histological findings. Macroscopic observation showed that SPIO-labeled MSCs were steered to the target region of cartilage defect. MRI revealed significant changes in signal intensity (P\textbackslashtextless0.01). HE staining exibited that a great number of MSCs formed a three-dimensional (3D) cell “sheet” structure at the chondral defect site. It was concluded that 0.57 T magnetic force permits spatial delivery of magnetically labeled MSCs to the target region in vitro. High-field MRI can serve as an very sensitive non-invasive technique for the visualization of SPIO-labeled MSCs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2019.07.004,MR imaging of cartilage repair surgery of the knee,"Articular cartilage is a complex tissue with unique properties that are essential for normal joint function. Many processes can result in cartilage injury, ranging from acute trauma to degenerative processes. Articular cartilage lacks vascularity, and therefore most chondral defects do not heal spontaneously and may require surgical repair. A variety of cartilage repair techniques have been developed and include bone marrow stimulation (microfracture), osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS) or osteochondral allograft transplantation, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), matrix-assisted chondrocyte implantation (MACI), and other newer processed allograft cartilage techniques. Although arthroscopy has long been considered as the gold standard for evaluation of cartilage after cartilage repair, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a non-invasive method to assess the repair site and can be scored using Magnetic resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART). MR also provides additional evaluation of the subchondral bone and for other potential causes of knee pain or internal derangement. Conventional MR can be used to evaluate the status of cartilage repair and potential complications. Compositional MR sequences can provide supplementary information about the biochemical contents of the reparative tissue. This article reviews the various types of cartilage repair surgeries and their postoperative MR imaging appearances.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-010-1042-3,Mid-term results of Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis for treatment of focal cartilage defects in the knee,"Articular cartilage defects heal poorly. Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC) is an innovative treatment for localized full-thickness cartilage defects combining the well-known microfracturing with collagen scaffold and fibrin glue. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the medium-term results of this enhanced microfracture technique for the treatment of chondral lesions of the knee. Thirty-two chondral lesions in 27 patients were treated with AMIC. Within the context of clinical follow-up, these patients were evaluated for up to 5 years after the intervention. Five different scores (Meyer score, Tegner score, Lysholm score, ICRS score, Cincinatti score) as well as radiographs were used for outcome analysis. Articular resurfacing was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The average age of patients (11 females, 16 males; mean body mass index 26, range 20-32) was 37 years (range 16-50 years). The mean defect size of the chondral lesions was 4.2 cm(2) (range 1.3-8.8 cm(2)). All defects were classified as grade IV according to the Outerbridge classification. The follow-up period was between 24 and 62 months with a mean of 37 months. Twenty out of 23 individuals (87%) questioned were subjectively highly satisfied with the results after surgery. Significant improvement (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05) of all scores was observed as early as 12 months after AMIC, and further increased values were notable up to 24 months postoperatively. MRI analysis showed moderate to complete filling with a normal to incidentally hyperintense signal in most cases. Results did not show a clinical impact of patient's age at the time of operation, body mass index and number of previous operations (n.s.). In contrast, males showed significant higher values in the ICRS score compared to their female counterparts. AMIC is an effective and safe method of treating symptomatic full-thickness chondral defects of the knee in appropriately selected cases. However, further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine whether the grafted area will maintain structural and functional integrity over time.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-004-0535-3,Early postoperative adherence of matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects of the femoral condyle,"Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) is a tissue-engineering technique for the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects and requires the use of a three-dimensional collagen type I-III membrane seeded with cultured autologous chondrocytes. The cell-scaffold construct is implanted in the debrided cartilage defect and fixed only with fibrin glue, with no periosteal cover or further surgical fixation. In a clinical pilot study, the MACI technique was used for the treatment of full-thickness, weight-bearing chondral defects of the femoral condyle in 16 patients. All patients were followed prospectively and the early postoperative attachment rate, 34.7 days (range: 22-47) after the scaffold implantation, was determined. With the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the transplant was graded as completely attached, partially attached, or detached. In 14 of 16 patients (87.5%), a completely-attached graft was found, and the cartilage defect site was totally covered by the implanted scaffold and repair tissue. In one patient (6.25%), a partial attachment occurred with partial filling of the chondral defect. A complete detachment of the graft was found in one patient (6.25%), which resulted in an empty defect site with exposure of the subchondral bone. Interobserver variability for the MRI grading of the transplants showed substantial agreement (kappa=0.775) and perfect agreement (kappa(w)=0.99). In conclusion, the implantation and fixation of a cell-scaffold construct in a deep cartilage defect of the femoral condyle with fibrin glue and with no further surgical fixation leads to a high attachment rate 34.7 days after the implantation, as determined with high resolution MRI.",0

A case report using three-dimensional image analysis software in knee osteoarthritis,"Mesenchymal stem cells are currently a research focus because of the possibility of cartilage regeneration through several mechanisms, including mesenchymal stem cell sheets. However, there are no published reports visualizing cartilage in three dimensions. Here, we report a case of improved cartilage volume. We purified and cultured adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and then performed adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy by directly injecting these cells into the articular cartilage. Cartilage was quantitatively evaluated before and after injection using three-dimensional image analysis software based on the magnetic resonance imaging.The patient, a 55-year-old Japanese woman, experienced pain in both knees and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee. We performed adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy in both knees at our hospital and quantitatively evaluated cartilage before and after the treatment using the three-dimensional image analysis software ""SYNAPSE VINCENT"".Preoperatively, the cartilage defect area was 33.59 mm2 in the femur and 122.31 mm2 in the tibia; however, 12 months postoperatively, it improved to 13.59 mm2 and 51.43 mm2, respectively. Furthermore, the preoperative femur and tibia volumes were 9.58 mL and 3.82 mL, respectively; however, 12 months postoperatively, these values improved to 10.00 mL and 4.17 mL, respectively. For the quantitative analysis of cartilage, SYNAPSE VINCENT visualizes the state of cartilage in a high-definition three-dimensional image, which is excellent for understanding the state of the disease and explaining it to the patient. Although SYNAPSE VINCENT can only analyze the thickness of cartilage, and the reproducibility of the error is debatable, SYNAPSE VINCENT would be useful as a clinical tool for regenerative medicine. We have shown in this case report the promising effects of adipose-derived stem cell intraarticular injections in treating osteoarthritis and the use of new diagnostic instruments.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/00004623-198870030-00027,Osteonecrosis of the knee.,"We have described two entities of osteonecrosis-like syndromes about the knee. One involves the medial femoral condyle and may or may not be associated with radiolucent lesions and collapse of the femoral condyle. Treatment depends on identification of the size and location of the lesion. The other entity is an osteonecrosis-like lesion of the tibial plateau. It usually occurs medially and may not be associated with radiographic changes. However, increased uptake on a bone scan from the medial side of the knee, best noted on the lateral view, will identify these lesions. Once the condition is recognized, the patient should be treated conservatively until the clinical course is defined. It is important to recognize these clinical problems so that unnecessary surgery may be avoided.",0

Methods A total of 23 patients with a mean age of 35.6 +/- 13.9 years were included in this study. The mean follow-up was 33.5 +/- 10.4 months (range 24-52.9 months). The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Foot Function Index (FFI). Postoperatively, lesion healing was assessed using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) protocol. Results There were no intraoperative or perioperative complications. In one patient, arthroscopic arthrolysis was performed due to painful arthrofibrosis. The mean VAS significantly decreased from 7.6 +/- 1.1 (range 4.2-9.3) to 1.4 +/- 2.2 (range 0-7.4) (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). The mean FFI significantly improved from 46.8 +/- 14.3 (range 24.3-80.8) to 15.9 +/- 11.4 (range 10.0-51.7) (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). The mean MOCART score at 1-year follow-up was 74.1 +/- 12.4 (range 50-95). Both preoperative and postoperative pains were significantly higher for smokers when compared to non-smokers. Conclusions The results of the present study study indicate that AMIC procedure can be performed through the anterolateral and anteromedial arthrotomy without malleolar osteotomy. Thus, the possible complications associated with malleolar osteotomy can be avoided. The AMIC procedure without a malleolar osteotomy can be considered a safe and reliable procedure in patients with osteochondral lesions localized anterior to the midline in the sagittal plane.",0

We transplanted synovial MSCs into cartilage defects using a simple method and investigated its usefulness and repair process in a pig model.The chondrogenic potential of the porcine MSCs was compared in vitro. Cartilage defects were created in both knees of seven pigs, and divided into MSCs treated and non-treated control knees. Synovial MSCs were injected into the defect, and the knee was kept immobilized for 10 min before wound closure. To visualize the actual delivery and adhesion of the cells, fluorescence-labeled synovial MSCs from transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) pig were injected into the defect in a subgroup of two pigs. In these two animals, the wounds were closed before MSCs were injected and observed for 10 min under arthroscopic control. The defects were analyzed sequentially arthroscopically, histologically and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for 3 months.Synovial MSCs had a higher chondrogenic potential in vitro than the other MSCs examined. Arthroscopic observations showed adhesion of synovial MSCs and membrane formation on the cartilage defects before cartilage repair. Quantification analyses for arthroscopy, histology and MRI revealed a better outcome in the MSC-treated knees than in the non-treated control knees.Leaving a synovial MSC suspension in cartilage defects for 10 min made it possible for cells to adhere in the defect in a porcine cartilage defect model. The cartilage defect was first covered with membrane, then the cartilage matrix emerged after transplantation of synovial MSCs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2020.04.001,Editorial Commentary: Cartilage Restoration—What Is Currently Available?,"In the past 30 years, bone marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture (MF) have become a popular method to treat symptomatic focal articular cartilage lesions. Nonetheless, recent studies have not shown good long-term clinical outcomes, and MF has produced alterations in the subchondral bone architecture with degenerative changes. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has shown good results at 20 years. Second- and third-generation ACI has shown superiority to MF and fewer complications than first-generation ACI. Each treatment option has its advantages and disadvantages. Recent research has shown that better filling of cartilage tissue occurs in patients treated with MF and collagen augmentation than in those treated with MF alone. Research from our clinic has shown that Hyaff scaffold combined with bone marrow aspirate concentrate in a 1-step technique yielded good results in patients with 10 years' follow-up. We believe that high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to directly compare all cartilage restoration procedures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2008.10.009,New Technique for Cell-Seeded Collagen Matrix-Supported Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation,"Autologous chondrocyte transplantation/implantation (ACT/ACI) is becoming increasingly common for the treatment of large cartilage defects in the knee joint. The traditional ACT technique involves injection of a suspension of cells into the cartilage defect, which is covered with a periosteal flap or collagen membrane. The technique requires extensive suturing to create an effective seal; however, cell leakage remains a potential problem. Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI/MACT) avoids this potential problem by using a membrane on which chondrocytes are seeded and cultured for several days, before the membrane is cut to the correct size and shape of the defect. Time-consuming extensive suturing is unnecessary. However, cutting and repeated manipulation of the seeded membrane may result in the loss of critical chondrocytes. A modified technique termed ACT-collagen membrane seeding (ACT-Cs) has been developed in which expanded chondrocytes are applied to the collagen membrane after it has been cut to size, substantially reducing the risk of viable cell loss while retaining the ease and speed of the MACI/MACT procedure. In addition, the seeding of mitotically active chondrocytes onto the membrane after expansion and immediately before transplantation allows direct application of high cell concentrations.",0
,[Treatment of deep cartilage defects of the knee with autologous chondrocyte transplantation: long-term results].,"The authors present the long-term results of surgical treatment of deep chondral defects of the knee (medial or lateral femoral condyle). They used the transplantation of autologous cultured chondrocytes in the form of a solid chondral graft.Indications for autologous chondrocyte transplantation most frequently included acute trauma to the knee. Patients with chondral lesions categorized as grades IIIa and IIIb by the Noyes-Stabler classification were indicated for this treatment. A small sample of healthy cartilage was harvested arthroscopically from the non-weight-bearing area of the knee and was sent to the Tissue Bank for chondrocyte cultivation. After 4 to 5 weeks the cultured chondrocytes were formed into a solid chondral graft, implanted at the damaged site of the medial or lateral femoral condyle and fixed with fibrin glue (Tissucol).Fifty-two patients, 34 males and 18 females (average age, 29 years range, 17 to 45 years) were treated using this method in the period from 2001 to 2009. Follow-up was 6 to 84 months, with an average of 46 months. Thirteen patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 7 to 39 months (average, 19 months) after the implantation. Full incorporation the chondrograft was observed in 12 patients (92.3%). The clinical results were evaluated by the Lysholm scoring system (1, 2 and 5 years after the operation) and showed significant improvement. In 24 patients, the chondrograft quality was evaluated by immunohistochemical methods in samples taken by second-look arthroscopy from the borders of implantation sites. Hyaline chondral tissue was detected in 100% samples by microscopic examination, and collagen type II was present in 100% samples examined by imnunohistochemistry using haematoxylin-eosin staining.A significant improvement in knee function was recorded when the pre-operative and final follow-up stages were compared. The autologous chondrocyte transplantation showed a potential for the treatment of large cartilage defects. The excellent results achieved allowed the patients to return to normal activity levels.This method is also convenient when ligament reconstruction is necessary during one operation.",0

Purpose To compare the clinical outcome of patients treated with second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation implants with those treated with the microfracture repair technique at 5-year follow-up. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods Eighty active patients (mean age, 29.8 years) and grade III to IV cartilage lesions of the femoral condyles or trochlea were treated with arthroscopic second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation Hyalograft C or microfracture (40 patients per group). Patients achieved a minimum 5-year follow-up and were prospectively evaluated. Results Both groups showed statistically significant improvement of all clinical scores from preoperative interval to 5-year follow-up. There was a significant improvement for the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score from preoperative to 5-year follow-up (Wilcoxon test, P &lt; .001). In the microfracture group, the International Knee Documentation Committee objective score increased from 2.5% normal and nearly normal knees before the operation to 75% normal and nearly normal knees at 5-year follow-up, and the subjective score increased from 41.1 ± 12.3 preoperatively to 70.2 ± 14.7 at 5-year follow-up. In the group treated with Hyalograft C, the International Knee Documentation Committee objective score increased from 15% normal and nearly normal knees before the operation to 90% normal and nearly normal knees at 5-year follow-up, and its subjective score increased from 40.5 ± 15.2 preoperatively to 80.2 ± 19.1 at 5-year follow-up (Wilcoxon test, P &lt; .001). When comparing the groups, better improvement of the International Knee Documentation Committee objective (P &lt; .001) and subjective (P = .003) scores was observed in the Hyalograft C group at 5-year follow-up. The return to sports at 2 years was similar in both groups and remained stable after 5 years in the Hyalograft C group; it worsened in the microfracture group. Conclusion Both methods have shown satisfactory clinical outcome at medium-term follow-up. Better clinical results and sport activity resumption were noted in the group treated with second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplantation.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.1634,Intra‐Articular Injection of Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee: A Proof‐of‐Concept Clinical Trial,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to have a potential for articular cartilage regeneration. However, most studies focused on focal cartilage defect through surgical implantation. For the treatment of generalized cartilage loss in osteoarthritis, an alternative delivery strategy would be more appropriate. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injection of autologous adipose tissue derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) for knee osteoarthritis. We enrolled 18 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and injected AD MSCs into the knee. The phase I study consists of three dose-escalation cohorts; the low-dose (1.0 × 10(7) cells), mid-dose (5.0 × 10(7)), and high-dose (1.0 × 10(8)) group with three patients each. The phase II included nine patients receiving the high-dose. The primary outcomes were the safety and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included clinical, radiological, arthroscopic, and histological evaluations. There was no treatment-related adverse event. The WOMAC score improved at 6 months after injection in the high-dose group. The size of cartilage defect decreased while the volume of cartilage increased in the medial femoral and tibial condyles of the high-dose group. Arthroscopy showed that the size of cartilage defect decreased in the medial femoral and medial tibial condyles of the high-dose group. Histology demonstrated thick, hyaline-like cartilage regeneration. These results showed that intra-articular injection of 1.0 × 10(8) AD MSCs into the osteoarthritic knee improved function and pain of the knee joint without causing adverse events, and reduced cartilage defects by regeneration of hyaline-like articular cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.l.01345,Novel Scaffold-Based BST-CarGel Treatment Results in Superior Cartilage Repair Compared with Microfracture in a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Microfracture, the standard of care, is recognized to be an incomplete solution for cartilage damage. BST-CarGel, a chitosan-based medical device, is mixed with autologous whole blood and is applied to a microfractured cartilage lesion in which it physically stabilizes the clot and guides and enhances marrow-derived repair. An international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate BST-CarGel treatment compared with microfracture alone in the repair of cartilage lesions in the knee.Eighty patients between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five years with a single, symptomatic focal lesion on the femoral condyles were randomized to BST-CarGel and microfracture treatment (n = 41) or microfracture treatment alone (n = 39). The primary end points of repair tissue quantity and quality at twelve months were assessed by quantitative three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging measuring the degree of lesion filling and T2 relaxation time with use of standardized one and twelve-month posttreatment scans. The secondary end point at twelve months was clinical benefit determined with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The tertiary end point was quality of life determined by the Short Form-36. Safety was assessed through the recording of adverse events.Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, although baseline lesion areas were slightly larger on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging for the BST-CarGel group compared with the microfracture group. Blinded quantitative magnetic resonance imaging analysis demonstrated that, at twelve months, when compared with microfracture treatment alone, BST-CarGel treatment met both primary end points by achieving statistical superiority for greater lesion filling (p = 0.011) and more hyaline cartilage-like T2 values (p = 0.033). The lesion filling values were 92.8% ± 2.0% for the BST-CarGel treatment group and 85.2% ± 2.1% for the microfracture treatment group, and the mean T2 values were 70.5 ± 4.5 ms for the BST-CarGel treatment group and 85.0 ± 4.9 ms for the microfracture treatment group. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales for pain, stiffness, and function yielded equivalent improvement for both groups at twelve months, which were significant (p < 0.0001) from baseline. Treatment safety profiles were considered comparable.At twelve months, BST-CarGel treatment resulted in greater lesion filling and superior repair tissue quality compared with microfracture treatment alone. Clinical benefit was equivalent between groups at twelve months, and safety was similar.",1

Biomechanical data have shown that blood causes harmful effects on overall cartilage function under loading conditions. Therefore, haemophilic patients suffering a haemarthrosis should be subjected to blood aspiration (arthrocentesis) to prevent cartilage damage. MRI and ultrasonography have shown themselves to be excellent noninvasive tools for the evaluation of early cartilage damage that remains undetectable by conventional radiography in haemophilic patients. Prophylaxis with the deficient factor can prevent cartilage deterioration and reduce the incidence of joint haemorrhage in children with haemophilia. Radiosynovectomy has proved to be a highly effective procedure to decrease both the frequency and the severity of recurrent intra-articular bleeding episodes. Nowadays, the most usual surgical procedures for treating articular cartilage defects (cartilage repair) include abrasion chondroplasty, microfracture, mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and matrix-induced ACI. In small defects (<2-4 cm(2)), ostechondral autograft or microfracture are the recommended options. In large defects (>2-4 cm(2)), ACI or osteochondral allograft are indicated. However, these techniques have not been applied in haemophilic patients because inflammatory conditions and advanced degenerative change (>50% joint space narrowing) are contraindications for cartilage repair. Thus, prevention of cartilage damage is paramount in haemophilia. The definitive remedy for advanced cartilage damage is either (knee or hip) replacement or (ankle) arthrodesis. Primary prophylaxis and radiosynovectomy are the best alternatives at our disposal to protect our patients against cartilage damage and arthropathy in haemophilic joints.",0

The efficacy of bone marrow stimulation with microfracture, of mosaicplasty and of various autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) techniques has been subject to numerous studies recently. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gained a major role in the assessment of cartilage repair. The introduction of high-field MRI to clinical routine makes high resolution and three-dimensional imaging readily available. New quantitative MRI techniques that directly visualize the molecular structure of cartilage may further advance our understanding of cartilage repair. The clinical evaluation of cartilage repair tissue is a complex issue, and MR imaging will become increasingly important both in research and in clinical routine. This article reviews the clinical aspects of microfracture, mosaicplasty, and ACI and reports the recent technical advances that have improved MRI of cartilage. Morphological evaluation methods are recommended for each of the respective techniques. Finally, an overview of T2 mapping and delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage in cartilage repair is provided.",0

Because a functional interaction between cartilage and bone is crucial, the pathophysiology of OA and its treatment strategy must focus also on subchondral bone. We investigated whether adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) injected into a joint at two different concentrations could prevent subchondral bone damage after the onset of mild OA in a rabbit model. We measured both volumetric and densitometric aspects of bone remodeling. Although OA can stimulate bone remodeling either catabolically or anabolically over time, the accelerated turnover does not allow complete mineralization of new bone and therefore gradually reduces its density. We measured changes in morphometric and densitometric bone parameters using micro-CT analysis and correlated them with the corresponding parameters in cartilage and meniscus. We found that ASCs promoted cartilage repair and helped counteract the accelerated bone turnover that occurs with OA.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465211057117,Outcomes of Autologous Osteochondral Transplantation With and Without Extracellular Matrix Cartilage Allograft Augmentation for Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"Autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) using a cylindrical graft in the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) is typically indicated for patients with larger lesions. However, with lesions that are irregular in shape, the AOT graft may not completely replace the lesion. For these lesions, we utilize extracellular matrix cartilage allograft (EMCA) augmentation in AOT to act as a physiologic grout at the host-graft interface.To determine if the combination of EMCA with concentrated bone marrow aspirate (CBMA) would improve integration of the host-graft interface and subsequently reduce postoperative cyst formation after AOT. It was also hypothesized that EMCA in conjunction with CBMA would demonstrate improved MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scores and functional outcome scores at a minimum 2 years after surgery.Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.A retrospective analysis was performed comparing patients treated with AOT/CBMA alone and AOT with CBMA/EMCA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score. Magnetic resonance imaging appearance was evaluated with the use of the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score. Cyst formation was also evaluated on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging.A total of 26 patients were included in the AOT + CBMA/EMCA group (10 male, 16 female), and 34 patients were included in the AOT/CBMA group (17 male, 17 female). The mean Foot and Ankle Outcome Score significantly improved in both groups (P < .001) across all subscales (symptoms, pain, activities of daily living, sports activities, and quality of life), but there was no significant difference between groups at final follow-up. There was no significant difference in mean MOCART scores between the groups (P = .118). In the AOT/CBMA group, 3 patients (8.8%) complained of knee pain, and 1 (2.9%) required additional surgery (hardware removal). In the AOT + CBMA/EMCA group, 2 patients (7.7%) complained of knee pain, and 6 patients (23%) required additional surgery (3 hardware removals and 3 arthroscopic debridements of scar tissue in the ankle).We found that while EMCA with CBMA has benefit in regeneration and repair of OLT treated with bone marrow stimulation, there appears to be little benefit of EMCA over CBMA alone as a physiologic grout at the graft-host interface in OLT treated with AOT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-019-01385-8,Bifunctional Labeling of Rabbit Mesenchymal Stem Cells for MR Imaging and Fluorescence Microscopy,"Purpose Longitudinal imaging studies are important in the translational process of stem cell-based therapies. Small animal imaging models are widely available and practical but insufficiently depict important morphologic detail. In contrary, large animal models are logistically challenging and costly but offer greater imaging quality. In order to combine the advantages of both, we developed an intermediate-sized rabbit animal model for cartilage imaging studies. Procedures Rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (rMSC) were isolated as primary cultures from the bone marrow of New Zealand white rabbits. rMSC were subsequentially transduced lentivirally with eGFP and magnetically labeled with the iron oxide ferucarbotran. eGFP expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and iron uptake was analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry and Prussian blue staining. Fluorescence microscopy of eGFP-transduced rMSC was performed. Viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed by XTT and caspase-3/-7 measurements. The chondrogenic potential of labeled cells was quantified by glycosaminoglycan contents in TGF-beta 3 induced pellet cultures. Labeled and unlabeled cells underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T before and after differentiation using T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted pulse sequences. Relaxation rates were calculated. rMSCs were implanted in fibrin clots in osteochondral defects of cadaveric rabbit knees and imaged by 7 T MRI. T2* maps were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple regression models. Results Efficiency of lentiviral transduction was greater than 90 %. Fluorescence signal was dose dependent. Cellular iron uptake was significant for all concentrations (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) and dose dependent (3.3-56.5 pg Fe/cell). Labeled rMSC showed a strong, dose-dependent contrast on all MR pulse sequences and a significant decrease in T2 and T2* relaxation rates. Compared with non-transduced or unlabeled controls, there were no adverse effects on cell viability, rate of apoptosis, or chondrogenic differentiation. MRI of labeled rMSCs in osteochondral defects showed a significant signal of the transplant with additional high-resolution anatomical information. Conclusions This intermediate-sized rabbit model and its bifunctional labeling technique allow for improved depiction of anatomic detail for noninvasive in vivo rMSC tracking with MRI and for immunohistological correlation by fluorescence microscopy.",0

Both rehabilitation interventions sought to protect the implant for an initial period, then incrementally increase load bearing. Under the ‘accelerated' protocol, patients reached full weight bearing at 8 weeks post-surgery, compared to 11 weeks for the ‘traditional' group. <h3>Results</h3> Patients in the ‘accelerated' group achieved greater 6min walk distances and daily activity levels as measured by accelerometry (<i>P</i><0.05) compared to the ‘traditional' group. Furthermore, the ‘accelerated' group reported significantly better improvement in knee pain at 12 weeks as indicated by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (<i>P</i><0.05), and regardless of the rehabilitation protocol employed, no patient suffered any adverse effect to the implant as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at 3 months. Comparison of each rehabilitation group with an unaffected control group revealed a significant difference in peak knee adduction and flexion moments for the traditional group (<i>P</i><0.05). However, there was no difference for accelerated patients (<i>P</i>>0.05), which may demonstrate a faster return to knee loading patterns typically observed in unaffected subjects. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The ‘accelerated' load bearing approach that reduced the length of time spent ambulating on crutches resulted in reduced knee pain, improved function, no graft complications and may speed up the recovery of normal gait function. Patient follow-up to at least 24 months would be required to observe longer-term graft outcomes.",1
https://doi.org/10.3727/000000007783465181,Comparison of Chondral Defects Repair with In Vitro and In Vivo Differentiated Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"The purpose of this study was to compare chondral defects repair with in vitro and in vivo differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). A novel PLGA-gelatin/chondroitin/hyaluronate (PLGA-GCH) hybrid scaffold with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-impregnated microspheres (MS-TGF) was fabricated to mimic the extracellular matrix. MS-TGF showed an initial burst release (22.5%) and a subsequent moderate one that achieved 85.1% on day 21. MSCs seeded on PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF or PLGA-GCH were incubated in vitro and showed that PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF significantly augmented proliferation of MSCs and glycosaminoglycan synthesis compared with PLGA-GCH. Then MSCs seeded on PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF were implanted and differentiated in vivo to repair chondral defect on the right knee of rabbit (in vivo differentiation repair group), while the contralateral defect was repaired with in vitro differentiated MSCs seeded on PLGA-GCH (in vitro differentiation repair group). The histology observation demonstrated that in vivo differentiation repair showed better chondrocyte morphology, integration, and subchondral bone formation compared with in vitro differentiation repair 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively, although there was no significant difference after 6 weeks. The histology grading score comparison also demonstrated the same results. The present study implies that in vivo differentiation induced by PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF and the host microenviroment could keep chondral phenotype and enhance repair. It might serve as another way to induce and expand seed cells in cartilage tissue engineering.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2017.08.282,The Influence of Full-Thickness Chondral Defects on Outcomes Following Meniscal Allograft Transplantation: A Comparative Study,"To compare a series of patients who underwent meniscus allograft transplantation (MAT) with full-thickness chondral defects (FTD) with those with no chondral defect (ND) with regard to the following: change in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from baseline to 2-year follow-up and baseline to the final follow-up (including comparisons to minimal clinically important differences), complications and complication rates, reoperations and reoperation rates/timing, and failures and time to failure (revision MAT or conversion to total knee arthroplasty).Patients who underwent isolated medial or lateral MAT between September 1997 and March 2013 with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up were retrospectively identified and split into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of FTD (femoral condyle or tibial plateau) identified intraoperatively after debridement to allow for a better understanding of the lesion characteristics (when applicable): ND (Outerbridge grade 0/I) or FTD (Outerbridge grade IV). Patients with osteochondritis dissecans were eligible for inclusion, as were those with isolated single lesions, multiple lesions, or bipolar lesions. Those with a moderate Outerbridge grade (II and III)-whether treated or neglected-were excluded given the poorer reliability of grading intermediate lesions. Indications for MAT included those patients with subjective complaints (persistent joint-line pain) and objective findings (previous meniscectomy or nonviable meniscus state with pain localized to the affected compartment) of functional meniscal deficiency. All lateral MAT patients used a bridge-in-slot surgical technique, as did most medial MAT patients (few patients with earlier surgical dates received a keyhole technique). All FTD were treated concurrently at the time of index MAT with cartilage restoration procedures (microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, DeNovo particulate cartilage grafting, or osteochondral auto/allografting). Reoperations, failures (revision MAT or conversion to arthroplasty), and PRO deltas were reported comparing baseline to 2-year follow-up and baseline to the final follow-up. Intergroup comparisons were made using Bonferroni-adjusted independent sample t-tests for continuous variables and χ-square for categorical variables.A total of 91 patients (22 ND and 69 FTD) were identified and followed for a mean 4.48 ± 2.63 and 3.84 ± 2.47 years, respectively. There were no significant between-group differences in age, body mass index, or number of prior surgeries. The mean chondral lesion size in the FTD group was 4.43 ± 2.5 cm2. Concomitant anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed significantly more in ND-group patients than FTD-group patients (8 [38.1%] vs 8 [11.8%], P = .004). There were no differences between ND-group and FTD-group patients in concomitant realignment procedures performed (2 [9.1%] vs 7 [10.1%], P = .986), or prior ligament reconstruction (9 [40.9%] vs 18 [26.1%], P = .111) or realignment procedure (0 [0%] vs 0 [0%]). FTD-group patients underwent concomitant osteochondral allograft (69.6%), autologous chondrocyte implantation (18.8%), microfracture (13.0%), osteochondral autograft (4.3%), or DeNovo juvenile particulate cartilage implantation (1.4%). A comparison of the patient groups found no statistically significant differences in PROs preoperatively (P > .003 for all). Intergroup comparisons of both the 2-year and final follow-up delta PRO scores showed no statistically (P > .003 for all) or clinically (number of PROs meeting minimal clinically important differences) significant differences. One complication occurred (fractured hardware) in the FTD-group patients (1.3%). There were no differences in the number of subsequent surgeries (revision MAT: ND, 2 (10.0%) vs FTD, 8 (12.9%); P = .845) or failures (conversion to total knee arthroplasty: ND, 1 (5.0%) vs FTD, 2 (3.3%); P = .646).When comparing a patient series with FTD who underwent MAT with a patient series with ND, there were no differences in the change in individual PROs from preoperative to the final follow-up. Similarly, there were no differences in complications or failure between those with ND or FTD diagnosed intraoperatively. The results of the current study suggest that chondral damage identified and treated by cartilage restoration means at the time of MAT may not affect the clinical outcomes of MAT.Level III, retrospective comparative study.",0

In this study, self-assembling tissue intermediates (TIs) derived from human periosteum-derived stem/progenitor cells (hPDCs) were generated and validated for stable cartilage formation in vivo using two different animal models. hPDCs were aggregated and cultured in the presence of a novel growth factor (GF) cocktail comprising of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2, growth differentiation factor (GDF)5, BMP6, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to study in vitro differentiation. Aggregates were then implanted ectopically in nude mice and orthotopically in critical-size osteochondral defects in nude rats and evaluated by microcomputed tomography (µCT) and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression analysis after 28 days of in vitro culture revealed the expression of early and late chondrogenic markers and a significant upregulation of NOGGIN as compared to human articular chondrocytes (hACs). Histological examination revealed a bilayered structure comprising of chondrocytes at different stages of maturity. Ectopically, TIs generated both bone and mineralized cartilage at 8 weeks after implantation. Osteochondral defects treated with TIs displayed glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production, type-II collagen, and lubricin expression. Immunostaining for human nuclei protein suggested that hPDCs contributed to both subchondral bone and articular cartilage repair. Our data indicate that in vitro derived osteochondral-like tissues can be generated from hPDCs, which are capable of producing bone and cartilage ectopically and behave orthotopically as osteochondral units.",0

The purpose of this study is to comprehensively review the clinical results and return to sport capacity in athletes following treatment for OLT.Recent findingsReparative procedures, such as bone marrow stimulation, and replacement procedures, such as autologous osteochondral transplantation, provide good clinical outcomes in short- and mid-term follow-up in the athlete. Recently, biological augmentation and scaffold-based therapies have been shown to improve clinical and radiological outcomes in OLT in both the general population and athletes.SummaryMost studies are of a low level of evidence. Studies analyzing the return to sport capability in athletes are further lacking. High-level evidence and well-designed clinical trials are required to establish the most effective treatment protocol.",0
https://doi.org/10.3944/aott.2011.2309,The results of reconstruction of the ACL using the cross-pin femoral system and four-strand hamstring tendon autografts,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of ACL reconstruction using a cross-pin femoral fixation system and hamstring autografts.The study included 49 men and one woman (mean age: 27.4 years; range: 15 to 44 years) with chronic ACL ruptures operatively treated between 2003 and 2006. Involvement was in the right knee in 27 patients, and the left knee in 23. There were no professional athletes included in the study. Patients with chondral lesions of the knee treated by microfracture or drilling or operated previously were excluded from the study. All patients had an ACL reconstruction with an autogenous four-strand hamstring graft. Thirty-five patients received treatment for other meniscal pathologies. All patients followed a similar accelerated rehabilitation program after surgery. Final evaluations were made using the Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring systems and the Tegner activity rating system in the final follow-up.Mean follow-up time was 43.9 (range: 29-57) months. Lysholm scores were good or excellent for 47 patients. IKDC scores were either Grade A or B for 48 patients. The mean Tegner activity score was 5.9 (range: 4-9) in the preoperative and 5.4 (range: 2-9) in the late postoperative period.Reconstruction of the ACL using four-strand hamstring tendons and cross-pin femoral fixation may be a safe and effective method, resulting in considerably high success rates.",0

Clinical evaluation (objective IKDC parameters and KT-1000 [MEDmetric, San Diego, CA] measurement), radiologic evaluation, and revision arthroscopy were performed between 1 and 2 years postoperatively.Twenty-three knees (mean age, 47.0 ± 5.8 years) were included. The rate of follow-up was 100% at 6.0 ± 0.8 years (range, 5.2 to 7.5 years), with no arthroplasty until then. The mean subjective IKDC score improved from 47.7 ± 11.1 to 72.8 ± 15.0 at 1 year, 70.9 ± 16.0 at 3 years, and 73.1 ± 16.4 at 5 years (P < .001). Clinical examination and revision arthroscopy were performed in 22 cases (95.5%) at 1.3 ± 0.5 years (range, 1.0 to 2.0 years). Four ACL grafts (18.1%) were insufficient, and 2 grafts (9.1%) were stable but showed signs of degeneration. Good cartilage regeneration was seen in most cases, but no correlation with subjective IKDC score was apparent (P = .528).HTO in combination with ACLR and a CR procedure is effective in the treatment of severe medial osteoarthritis with concomitant ACL insufficiency and varus malalignment. The effect of the CR, as well as the reason for the considerable rate of graft insufficiency, remains unclear.",0

Certaines visent à stimuler la réparation naturelle du cartilage par le recrutement de cellules progénitrices contenues dans la moelle (microfractures), d’autres ont pour objectif la réparation du défect par une greffe ( mosaicplasty ). Enfin, les techniques de thérapie cellulaire ont pour ambition la régénération complète de la lésion par l’implantation de cellules chondrogéniques ou de véritables tissus fonctionnels fabriqués au laboratoire à partir de cellules souches mésenchymateuses et de matériaux supports résorbables. Ces nouvelles thérapies ouvrent des perspectives exaltantes pour la prise en charge des lésions chondrales focales et permettent d’envisager une réparation tissulaire par des substituts autologues dont la composition et la structure reflètent celles du cartilage natif.

The treatment of full thickness articular defects remains a challenging problem for the orthopaedic surgeon. Beside bone marrow stimulation techniques (microfractures) and autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty, a variety of procedures have been proposed to promote the healing of articular lesions by cultured competent cells. Tissue engineering is an emerging field, whose goal is to repair or replace tissues and organs by delivering the appropriate cells, biomaterials and signaling factors to diseased or damaged areas. In this article, we review the preclinical and clinical literature reported on the fabrication of implantable cartilage structures from chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells and discuss potential areas of development in the field of cartilage repair. Before routine use of engineered cartilage grafts in the clinic, the safety and efficacy of these therapies need to be validated in prospective human clinical trials.",0
https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.44270,"Biomechanically, structurally and functionally meticulously tailored polycaprolactone/silk fibroin scaffold for meniscus regeneration","Meniscus deficiency, the most common and refractory disease in human knee joints, often progresses to osteoarthritis (OA) due to abnormal biomechanical distribution and articular cartilage abrasion. However, due to its anisotropic spatial architecture, complex biomechanical microenvironment, and limited vascularity, meniscus repair remains a challenge for clinicians and researchers worldwide. In this study, we developed a 3D printing-based biomimetic and composite tissue-engineered meniscus scaffold consisting of polycaprolactone (PCL)/silk fibroin (SF) with extraordinary biomechanical properties and biocompatibility. We hypothesized that the meticulously tailored composite scaffold could enhance meniscus regeneration and cartilage protection. Methods: The physical property of the scaffold was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, degradation test, frictional force of interface assessment, biomechanical testing, and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. To verify the biocompatibility of the scaffold, the viability, morphology, proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production of synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cell (SMSC) on the scaffolds were assessed by LIVE/DEAD staining, alamarBlue assay, ELISA analysis, and qRT-PCR. The recruitment ability of SMSC was tested by dual labeling with CD29 and CD90 by confocal microscope at 1 week after implantation. The functionalized hybrid scaffold was then implanted into the meniscus defects on rabbit knee joint for meniscus regeneration, comparing with the Blank group (no scaffold) and PS group. The regenerated meniscus tissue was evaluated by histological and immunohistochemistry staining, and biomechanical test. Macroscopic and histological scoring was performed to assess the outcome of meniscus regeneration and cartilage protection in vivo. Results: The combination of SF and PCL could greatly balance the biomechanical properties and degradation rate to match the native meniscus. SF sponge, characterized by fine elasticity and low interfacial shear force, enhanced energy absorption capacity of the meniscus and improved chondroprotection. The SMSC-specific affinity peptide (LTHPRWP; L7) was conjugated to the scaffold to further increase the recruitment and retention of endogenous SMSCs. This meticulously tailored scaffold displayed superior biomechanics, structure, and function, creating a favorable microenvironment for SMSC proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. After 24 weeks of implantation, the histological assessment, biochemical contents, and biomechanical properties demonstrated that the polycaprolactone/silk fibroin-L7 (PS-L7) group was close to the native meniscus group, showing significantly better cartilage protection than the PS group. Conclusion: This tissue engineering scaffold could greatly strengthen meniscus regeneration and chondroprotection. Compared with traditional cell-based therapies, the meniscus tissue engineering approach with advantages of one-step operation and reduced cost has a promising potential for future clinical and translational studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-017-4591-x,Treatment of talus osteochondral defects in chronic lateral unstable ankles: small-sized lateral chondral lesions had good clinical outcomes,"PURPOSE: To assess and compare the clinical and MRI outcomes of patients with talus osteochondral defect (OCD) and patients without OCD in a cohort with chronic lateral ankle instability. METHODS: All patients who underwent open or arthroscopic anterior talofibular ligament repair of the lateral ligament complex by a single surgeon were included in this study. Ankle arthroscopic surgery was initially performed to manage any intra-articular OCD, including debridement and microfracture. Functional scores (AOFAS, Karlsson score) and Tegner activity level scores were determined. An MRI scan was performed at follow-up to assess talus OCD after treatment. Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated between functional scores and various factors. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients with chronic ankle instability were included in this study. Among them, 33 patients had cartilage injury on the talus (OCD group), and the other 71 patients had no cartilage injury (control group). After surgery, there was a significant increase in the AOFAS scores (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001), the Karlsson scores (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001), and the Tegner activity scores (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001) in both the OCD group and the control group. However, there was no significant difference in the AOFAS scores (90.7 ± 6.6 vs. 92.5 ± 8.5; n.s.), the Karlsson scores (89.7 ± 9.3 vs. 91.2 ± 9.1; n.s.), or the Tegner activity scores (5 vs. 6; n.s.) between the OCD group and the control group postoperatively. In the OCD group, there was a significant negative association between the functional scores (AOFAS, Karlsson score, or Tegner score) and the number of intra-articular lesions. For the lateral OCD, the mean lesion area significantly decreased from 49.0 ± 10.7 mm(2) preoperatively to 18.3 ± 13.1 mm(2) at the final follow-up (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001). CONCLUSION: No significant difference in functional outcomes was found between the OCD group and the control group postoperatively. Arthroscopic microfracture is a good option for the long-term treatment of lateral talus OCD. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.",0
https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.930527,Outcomes from Osteochondral Autograft Transplant or Mosaicplasty in 26 Patients with Type V Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"BACKGROUND Mosaicplasty osteochondral transplantation (MOT) has been proved a feasible choice for the treatment of talus osteochondral injury. It can reduce ankle pain and allow performance of daily living activities and elementary sports. However, there are very little data on the restoration of normal life with large lesions. Our investigation focused on assessing outcomes in patients with large lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS The MOT operation was used, and the donor site was located at the lateral condyle of the femur. Clinical evaluation included the Berndt and Harty outcome question, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score (during rest, walking and running), American Orthopedic Foot and ankle Association (AOFAS) score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Twenty-four months after surgery, the graft binding was assessed by MRI using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. RESULTS We assessed 26 patients, including 14 males and 12 females. The average follow-up time was 33.9±5.2 months. The average lesion size was 173.1±23.5 mm². The average VAS score during rest improved from 4.62±0.85 preoperatively to 1.08±0.27 postoperatively (P<0.05), the score during walking improved from 5.19±0.63 preoperatively to 1.15±0.37 postoperatively (P<0.05), and the score during running improved from 6.08±0.74 preoperatively to 1.39±0.57 postoperatively (P<0.05). The average postoperative AOFAS ankle score improved to 91.5±2.6 (range, 88 to 96), compared with preoperative 75.0±2.8 (range, 70 to 79) (P<0.05). Two patients developed pain in the donor site of the knee joint, and both of them had 2 or more osteochondral plugs harvested. The postoperative SF-36 score increased to 92.2±2.4 (P<0.05). In the last follow-up, 18 patients answered the Berndt and Harty outcome question, all with good as the result. CONCLUSIONS MOT is a feasible choice for patients with larger lesions. It can improve the VAS/AOFAS/IKDC/SF-36 scores, and has high patient satisfaction. Graft incorporation helps improve patient quality of life. Our results indicate that a larger osteochondral plug area increases the risk of developing knee donor site pain.",0

Randomized, prospective studies with adequate power comparing the myriad of surgical techniques used to treat chondral injuries are still lacking and it remains a challenge for the surgeon treating patients to make evidence-based decisions.We reviewed the history of the major cartilage repair/restorative procedures, indications for currently available repair/restorative procedures, and postoperative management.We performed searches using MEDLINE and cartilage-specific key words to identify all English-language literature. Articles were selected based on their contributions to our current understanding of the basic science and clinical treatment of articular cartilage lesions or historical importance. We then selected 77 articles, two of which are articles of historical importance.Current cartilage restorative techniques include débridement, microfracture, osteochondral fragment repair, osteochondral allograft, osteochondral autograft, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Pending techniques include two-staged cell-based therapies integrated into a variety of scaffolds, single-stage cell-based therapy, and augmentation of marrow stimulation, each with suggested indications including lesion size, location, and activity demands of the patient. The literature demonstrates variable improvements in pain and function contingent upon multiple variables including indications and application.For the patient with symptomatic chondral injury, numerous techniques are available to the surgeon to relieve pain and improve function. Until rigorous clinical trials (prospective, adequately powered, randomized control) are available, treatment decisions should be guided by expert extrapolation of the available literature based in historically sound principles.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/aor.12199,Implantation of Scaffold-Free Engineered Cartilage Constructs in a Rabbit Model for Chondral Resurfacing,"Joint resurfacing techniques offer an attractive treatment for damaged or diseased cartilage, as this tissue characteristically displays a limited capacity for self-repair. While tissue-engineered cartilage constructs have shown efficacy in repairing focal cartilage defects in animal models, a substantial number of cells are required to generate sufficient quantities of tissue for the repair of larger defects. In a previous study, we developed a novel approach to generate large, scaffold-free cartilaginous constructs from a small number of donor cells (20 000 cells to generate a 3-cm(2) tissue construct). As comparable thicknesses to native cartilage could be achieved, the purpose of the present study was to assess the ability of these constructs to survive implantation as well as their potential for the repair of critical-sized chondral defects in a rabbit model. Evaluated up to 6 months post-implantation, allogenic constructs survived weight bearing without a loss of implant fixation. Implanted constructs appeared to integrate near-seamlessly with the surrounding native cartilage and also to extensively remodel with increasing time in vivo. By 6 months post-implantation, constructs appeared to adopt both a stratified (zonal) appearance and a biochemical composition similar to native articular cartilage. In addition, constructs that expressed superficial zone markers displayed higher histological scores, suggesting that transcriptional prescreening of constructs prior to implantation may serve as an approach to achieve superior and/or more consistent reparative outcomes. As the results of this initial animal study were encouraging, future studies will be directed toward the repair of chondral defects in more mechanically demanding anatomical locations.",0

Short-term results using autologous chondrocyte implantation have been promising. Purpose: To report the long-term outcomes of patients who underwent autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) of the talus after failed marrow stimulation techniques for osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients underwent ACI of the talus, and 29 patients (15 male, 14 female; mean age, 34 years [range, 16-54 years]) were available for follow-up. There were 23 medial and 6 lateral lesions, with a mean size of 18 × 11 mm (198 mm 2 ; range, 80-500 mm 2 ). Twenty patients underwent ACI of the talus alone; 9 underwent ACI with bone grafting of underlying cysts. Follow-up was performed at a mean of 70 months (range, 24-129 months). Patient outcomes were evaluated using the simplified symptomatology score, Tegner activity score, Finsen score, and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score. Twenty-five patients (86%) underwent second-look arthroscopic surgery at the time of hardware removal and were assessed with the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 24 patients (83%) and compared with preoperative MRI scans. Results: Preoperatively, 26 patients rated their ankles as poor and 3 as fair using the simplified symptomatology score. At last follow-up, 9 were classified as excellent, 14 as good, 5 as fair, and 1 as poor using the same score. The mean AOFAS score improved from 50.1 to 85.9 (range, 65-100). The mean Tegner activity score improved from 1.6 to 4.3 ( P &lt; .0001). The mean Finsen score (modified Weber score) showed significant improvement from 13.7 to 5.1 ( P &lt; .0001).

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546517745281,Randomized Study of Long-term (15-17 Years) Outcome After Microfracture Versus Mosaicplasty in Knee Articular Cartilage Defects,"Background: Few comparative randomized long-term studies on microfracture versus mosaicplasty have been published, and only 2 studies reported a follow-up of 10 years. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose was to compare the clinical outcome of microfracture versus mosaicplasty/osteochondral autograft transfer in symptomatic cartilage lesions. The null hypothesis was that the outcome was not statistically different at any point of time. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty patients with articular cartilage defects were randomized to undergo cartilage repair by either microfracture (n = 20) or mosaicplasty (n = 20). Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 to 50 years at the time of surgery, 1 or 2 symptomatic focal full-thickness articular chondral defects on the femoral condyles or trochlea, and size 2 to 6 cm 2 . The main outcome variable was the Lysholm knee score recorded before the surgery and at 12 months, median 5 years, median 10 years, and minimum 15 years after the surgery. Results: Forty patients were included in the study (28 men, 12 women; median age, 32 years; range, 18-48 years). Defects with a median size of 3.5 cm 2 (range, 2-5 cm 2 ) were treated. A significant increase in the Lysholm score was seen for all subjects— from a mean 53 (SD, 16) at baseline to 69 (SD, 21) at the minimum 15-year follow-up ( P = .001). The mean Lysholm score was significantly higher in the mosaicplasty group than the microfracture group at 12 months, median 5 years, median 10 years, and minimum 15 years: 77 (SD, 17) versus 61 (SD, 22), respectively ( P = .01), at the last follow-up. At all follow-up time points, the difference in mean Lysholm score was clinically significant (&gt;10 points). Conclusion: At short, medium, and long term (minimum 15 years), mosaicplasty results in a better, clinically relevant outcome than microfracture in articular cartilage defects (2-5 cm 2 ) of the distal femur of the knee in patients aged 18 to 50 years.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546513518007,One-Step Surgery With Multipotent Stem Cells for the Treatment of Large Full-Thickness Chondral Defects of the Knee,"Background: Chondral lesions in athletically active patients cause considerable morbidity, and treatment with existing cell-based therapies can be challenging. Bone marrow has been shown as a possible source of multipotent stem cells (MSCs) with chondrogenic potential and is easy to harvest during the same surgical procedure. Purpose: To investigate the clinical outcome in a group of active patients with large full-thickness chondral defects of the knee treated with 1-step surgery using bone marrow–derived MSCs and a second-generation matrix. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: From January 2007 to February 2010, 25 patients (average age, 46.5 years) with symptomatic large chondral defects of the knee (International Cartilage Repair Society grade 4) who underwent cartilage transplantation with MSCs and a collagen type I/III matrix were followed up for a minimum of 3 years. The average lesion size was 8.3 cm 2 . Coexisting injuries were treated during the same surgical procedure in 18 patients. All patients underwent a standard postoperative rehabilitation program. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations at 1-year, 2-year, and final follow-up included radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm, Marx, and Tegner scores. Seven patients underwent second-look arthroscopic surgery, with 4 consenting to a tissue biopsy. Results: No patients were lost at final follow-up. The average preoperative values for the evaluated scores were significantly improved at final follow-up ( P &lt; .001): VAS, 5.4 ± 0.37 to 0.48 ± 0.19; IKDC subjective, 37.92 ± 4.52 to 81.73 ± 2.42; KOOS pain, 61.04 ± 3.95 to 93.32 ± 1.92; KOOS symptoms, 55.64 ± 3.23 to 89.32 ± 2.32; KOOS activities of daily living, 63.96 ± 4.48 to 91.20 ± 2.74; KOOS sports, 34.20 ± 5.04 to 80.00 ± 3.92; KOOS quality of life, 32.20 ± 4.43 to 83.04 ± 3.37; Lysholm, 46.36 ± 2.25 to 86.52 ± 2.73; Marx, 3.00 ± 0.79 to 9.04 ± 0.79; and Tegner, 2.12 ± 0.32 to 5.64 ± 0.26. Patients younger than 45 years of age and those with smaller or single lesions showed better outcomes. The MRI scans showed good stability of the implant and complete filling of the defect in 80% of patients, and hyaline-like cartilage was found in the histological analysis of the biopsied tissue. No adverse reactions or postoperative complications were noted. Conclusion: The treatment of large chondral defects with MSCs is an effective procedure and can be performed routinely in clinical practice. Moreover, it can be achieved with 1-step surgery, avoiding a previous surgical procedure to harvest cartilage and subsequent chondrocyte cultivation.",0

A matched control group was included, comprising 34 patients with intact articular cartilage at the time of ACL reconstruction. There were 34 patients in the OAT-ACL group, 34 in the microfracture (MF)-ACL group, 34 in the debridement (D)-ACL group, and 34 in the control group with intact articular cartilage (IAC-ACL group). The mean time from ACL injury to operation was 19.32 ± 3.43 months, and the mean follow-up was 36.1 months (range, 34 to 37 months). Patients were evaluated with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner activity score, and clinical assessment.Of 102 patients, 97 (95%) were available for the final follow-up. According to the subjective IKDC score, all 4 groups fared significantly better at the 3-year follow-up than preoperatively (P < .005). The OAT-ACL group's IKDC subjective knee evaluation was significantly better than that of the MF-ACL group (P = .024) and D-ACL group (P = .018). However, the IKDC subjective score of the IAC-ACL group was significantly better than the OAT-ACL group's IKDC evaluation (P = .043). There was no significant difference between the MF-ACL and D-ACL groups' IKDC subjective scores (P = .058). Evaluation of manual pivot-shift knee laxity according to the IKDC knee examination form showed similar findings for the 4 groups immediately postoperatively and at 3-year follow-up, and the findings were rated as normal or nearly normal (IKDC grade A or B) in 29 of 33 patients (88%) in the OAT-ACL group, 28 of 32 patients (88%) in the MF-ACL group, 27 of 32 patients (84%) in the D-ACL group, and 31 of 34 patients (91%) in the IAC-ACL group.Our study shows that intact articular cartilage during ACL reconstruction yields more favorable IKDC subjective scores compared with any other articular cartilage surgery type. However, if an articular defect is present, the subjective IKDC scores are significantly better for OAT versus microfracture or debridement after a mean period of 3 years. Anterior knee stability results were not significantly affected by the different articular cartilage treatment methods.Level II, prospective comparative study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2008.01.042,Marrow stimulation techniques,"Due to the very low intrinsic activity of human adult cartilage, healing of chondral and osteochondral defects in patients cannot be expected. In treating symptomatic cartilage damage, marrow stimulation methods belong to the most frequently used methods, along with autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) and mosaicplasty. These arthroscopic procedures are generally easy and the marrow stimulation treatment costs relatively little. In recent years, Pridie drilling has been increasingly replaced by the microfracture technique. This modification relies on the same biological principles of promoting resurfacing with the formation of fibro-cartilaginous repair tissue. For the treatment of smaller cartilage defects (<2.5 cm(2)), microfracture still remains the first choice for treatment. The clinical results after microfracture in the knee are age dependent. Younger and active patients (<40 years) with smaller isolated traumatic lesions on the femoral condyles have the best long-term results. The deterioration of the clinical results begins after 18 months and is significantly more pronounced in older patients with defects on the patella-femoral joint and tibia. The inferior quality of the repair tissue, partially incomplete defect filling and new bone formation in the defect area seem to be limitations of these methods. The AMIC (autologous matrix induced chondrogenesis) technique was developed to enable treatment of larger defects by the application of a collagen Type III/I membrane (Geistlich Pharma, Wolhusen, Switzerland), in particular when cell-engaged procedures such as ACT cannot be used for financial reasons or because it is not indicated. AMIC seems to be particularly suitable for treating damaged retropatellar cartilage, which is an advantage because these defects can be hard to treat with standard microfracturing alone. The results of the ongoing studies are awaited to establish whether better results with this technology are achievable in the long term.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516681000,Cell-Seeded Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation: A Simplified Implantation Technique That Maintains High Clinical Outcomes,"Background: The use of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) remains limited, even though multiple studies have demonstrated success rates exceeding 75%. The procedure is perceived as invasive and technically challenging, presenting barriers to more widespread adoption. Purpose/Hypothesis: The objective of this study was to investigate whether outcomes and the failure rate of a simplified ACI technique (cs-ACI) were comparable with those of the more complicated traditional technique of a chondrocyte suspension injected under a collagen membrane (cACI). We hypothesized that the change in technique would not negatively affect outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Thirty-nine patients treated with the cs-ACI technique fulfilled the inclusion requirements. A group of 45 patients treated previously with standard cACI was used as a comparison. The functional outcomes were prospectively collected both preoperatively and postoperatively at the last follow-up. Failure was defined as any graft removal of more than 25% of the original defect size. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed postoperatively, and scans were assessed using a modified MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scoring system. Results: Group demographics were not significantly different, except for the defect size and mean follow-up: 4.09 years in the cACI group and 2.46 years in the cs-ACI group. Significant improvements were seen in all outcome measures except the Tegner score from the preoperative baseline to the latest follow-up for both the cACI group (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score, from 42.0 to 63.4; Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]–Pain subscore, from 58.7 to 77.1; Lysholm score, from 57.2 to 69.7; and Tegner score, from 3.5 to 4.2) and the cs-ACI group (IKDC score, from 45.6 to 68.0; KOOS-Pain subscore, from 66.6 to 84.7; Lysholm score, from 53.7 to 75.4; and Tegner score, from 3.2 to 3.8). No significant difference was found between the groups at the latest follow-up. The failure rate at 2 years was not significantly different, while the total failure rate over the entire study period was significantly lower in the cs-ACI group than the cACI group (5% vs 24%, respectively). The overall MOCART score was not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: The treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects with a simplified cell-seeded ACI technique demonstrated no significant differences in the failure rate and patient-reported outcomes when compared with a standard technique utilizing interrupted sutures and the injection of a cell suspension under a collagen membrane.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtla.2020.100609,Guided bone marrow stimulation for articular cartilage repair through a freeze-dried chitosan microparticle approach,"Abstract A novel approach for stimulating articular cartilage repair was developed and evaluated in skeletally aged Arcott sheep with signs of early osteoarthritis. Freeze-dried (FD) chitosan formulations were optimized to produce ultraporous cylinders that slowly rehydrate and disperse into bioactive chitosan microparticles in coagulating blood plasma. FD-chitosan implants (80% Degree of Deacetylation, 85 kDa) were produced at 3 doses (initial concentrations of 5, 10, 20 mg/mL, pH 2.5). Full-thickness cartilage defects were created bilaterally in medial femoral condyles of 8–9 year-old sheep (N = 12), microdrilled with 11 holes, then in one knee per sheep, one implant cylinder was inserted into each bleeding drill hole. At 1 day (N = 2), 3 months (N = 5) and 9 months (N = 5) post-operative, repair tissues were analyzed macroscopically and by micro-computed tomography, histology, biochemistry, and mechanics. Chitosan microparticles were detected in day 1 subchondral blood clots and mostly cleared at 3 months. At 3 months, microdrill holes were 2-fold larger, filled with angiogenic granulation tissue, callus, and woven bone, with more chondroinduction in treated versus control drill holes (p = 0.021). At 9 months, biomaterial treatment enhanced bone plate repair and stimulated 68% cartilage resurfacing vs 53% for drill-only controls (p = 0.047). Both treated and control cartilage repair tissues had lower glycosaminoglycan content than intact cartilage and were thinner, stiffer, and more permeable. Upon indentation, hyaline-like repair cartilage showed poroelastic behavior. This study showed that FD-chitosan can be locally delivered to incorporate chitosan microparticles into subchondral bone blood clots and exert anabolic therapeutic effects on articular cartilage resurfacing in aged sheep knees.",0

Design A literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Patients were included if they possessed a chondral defect of the humeral head, glenoid, or both, which had been treated with a joint preserving nonarthroplasty procedure. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies scoring system. Study demographics, surgical technique, imaging findings, patient-reported outcomes, complications, failures, and reoperations were collected. Results Fourteen studies with 98 patients (100 shoulders) met the inclusion criteria. Patient ages ranged from 7 to 74 years. The nonarthroplasty surgical techniques utilized included microfracture (67 shoulders), osteochondral transplantation (28 shoulders), chondrocyte transplantation (4 shoulders), and internal fixation (1 shoulder). The rates of radiographic union and progression of osteoarthritis ranged between 90% to 100% and 57% to 100%, respectively. Visual analog scores ranged from 0 to 1.9 at final follow-up. Mean postoperative ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) shoulder scores ranged from 75.8-100. Mean postoperative CSS (Constant Shoulder Score) scores ranged from 83.3-94. Mean postoperative SSV (Subjective Shoulder Value) ranged from 70% to 99%. Failure and reoperation rates ranged between 0% to 35% and 0% to 30%, respectively, with the most common reoperation being conversion to prosthetic arthroplasty. Conclusions In this systematic review, nonarthroplasty surgical techniques demonstrated acceptable rates of radiographic healing, improved patient reported outcomes, minimal complications, and low rates of failure or reoperation. Joint preserving techniques are likely viable options to prolong function of the native shoulder and provide short- to midterm pain relief in young and highly active patients.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s40634-021-00350-1,Is T2 mapping reliable in evaluation of native and repair cartilage tissue of the knee?,"Abstract Purpose To evaluate the effect of imaging plane and experience of observers on the reliability of T2 mapping of native and repair cartilage tissue of the knee. Methods Fifteen consecutive patients from two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this cross-sectional study. Patients with an isolated knee cartilage lesion were randomised to receive either debridement or microfracture (RCT 1) or debridement or autologous chondrocyte implantation (RCT 2). T2 mapping was performed in coronal and sagittal planes two years postoperatively. A musculoskeletal radiologist, a resident of radiology and two orthopaedic surgeons measured the T2 values independently. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) with 95% Confidence Intervals was used to calculate the inter- and intraobserver agreement. Results Mean age for the patients was 36.8 ± 11 years, 8 (53%) were men. The overall interobserver agreement varied from poor to good with ICCs in the range of 0.27– 0.76 for native cartilage and 0.00 – 0.90 for repair tissue. The lowest agreement was achieved for evaluations of repair cartilage tissue. The estimated ICCs suggested higher inter- and intraobserver agreement for radiologists. On medial femoral condyles, T2 values were higher for native cartilage on coronal images ( p &lt; 0.001) and for repair tissue on sagittal images ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The reliability of T2 mapping of articular cartilage is influenced by the imaging plane and the experience of the observers. This influence may be more profound for repair cartilage tissue. This is important to consider when using T2 mapping to measure outcomes after cartilage repair surgery.

https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.21173,A novel MSC-seeded triphasic construct for the repair of osteochondral defects,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are increasingly replacing chondrocytes in tissue engineering based research for treatment of osteochondral defects. The aim of this work was to determine whether repair of critical-size chronic osteochondral defects in an ovine model using MSC-seeded triphasic constructs would show results comparable to osteochondral autografting (OATS). Triphasic implants were engineered using a beta-tricalcium phosphate osseous phase, an intermediate activated plasma phase, and a collagen I hydrogel chondral phase. Autologous MSCs were used to seed the implants, with chondrogenic predifferentiation of the cells used in the cartilage phase. Osteochondral defects of 4.0 mm diameter were created bilaterally in ovine knees (n = 10). Six weeks later, half of the lesions were treated with OATS and half with triphasic constructs. The knees were dissected at 6 or 12 months. With the chosen study design we were not able to demonstrate significant differences between the histological scores of both groups. Subcategory analysis of O'Driscoll scores showed superior cartilage bonding in the 6-month triphasic group compared to the autograft group. The 12-month autograft group showed superior cartilage matrix morphology compared to the 12-month triphasic group. Macroscopic and biomechanical analysis showed no significant differences at 12 months. Autologous MSC-seeded triphasic implants showed comparable repair quality to osteochondral autografts in terms of histology and biomechanical testing. © 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Clinical Outcomes with Greater Than 2 Years Follow-up,"To compare the osteochondral allograft (OCA) outcomes of bipolar defects with isolated femoral defects and to investigate the optimal treatment of bipolar defects by comparing femoral OCA with tibial debridement to femoral OCA and tibial microfracture.A series of patients with 2-year follow-up from March 2004 to September 2015 after femoral OCA for bipolar chondral defects was identified. Group 1 contained patients with tibial defects treated with debridement and group 2 contained patients with microfractured tibial defects. A third group (group 3) with isolated femoral defects treated with OCA was identified and matched by gender, body mass index (BMI), laterality, and OCA size to groups 1 and 2. Patient-specific, defect-specific, intraoperative, and postoperative data including patient-reported outcomes were collected on all patients. The study groups were compared using analyses of variance, paired sample t tests, and χ-square analyses.Thirty-six patients who had femoral OCA for bipolar lesions were identified with 20 patients in group 1 and 16 patients in group 2. Group 3 had 20 patients. There were no differences between the 3 groups in terms of gender (P = .616), BMI (P = .271), number of previous surgeries (P = .451), femoral or tibial defect size (P = .296), and OCA size (P = .981). Preoperative to postoperative patient-reported clinical outcomes (PROs) revealed statistical and clinically meaningful improvement in all 3 groups, but did not differ between groups. Patient-specific and defect-specific factors did not correlate with PROs. The graft survivorship for group 1 was 85% at 4.5 years, 100% for group 2 at 2.5 years, and 95% for group 3 at 3.8 years.Regardless of tibial treatment, patients with bipolar defects treated with femoral OCA have clinically meaningful improvements in PROs and excellent graft survivorship comparable to isolated femoral OCAs at more than 2 years.Level III, case-control study.",0

Only those athletes playing in competitive sports at regional or national levels were included in the study. Fifty-seven athletes (95%) were available for a follow-up. There were 28 athletes in the OAT group and 29 athletes in the MF group. The mean duration of symptoms was 21.32 ± 5.57 months and the mean follow-up was 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months), and none of the athletes had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. Patients were evaluated using modified Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scores, radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical assessment. An independent observer performed a follow-up examination after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. At 12.4 months postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histologic evaluation was carried out. A radiologist and a pathologist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment, did the radiologic and histologic evaluations. <b>Results:</b> After 37.1 months, both groups had significant clinical improvement (<i>P</i> < .05). According to the modified HSS and ICRS scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 52% for the MF procedure (<i>P</i> < .001). At 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery, the HSS and ICRS showed statistically significantly better results in the OAT group (<i>P</i> = .03; <i>P</i> = .006; <i>P</i> = .006). Younger athletes did better in both groups. No serious complications were reported. There was 1 failure in the OAT group and 9 in the MF group. The ICRS Cartilage Repair Assessment for macroscopic evaluation during arthroscopy at 12.4 months showed excellent or good repairs in 84% after OAT and in 57% after MF. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 58% of the patients and histologic evaluation of repair showed better scores (according to ICRS) for the OAT group (<i>P</i> < .05). MRI evaluation showed excellent or good repairs in 94% after OAT compared with 49% after MF. Twenty-six (93%) OAT patients and 15 (52%) MF patients returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4 to 8 months). Others showed a decline in sports activity level. <b>Conclusions:</b> At an average of 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months) follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in young active athletes under the age of 40 has shown significant superiority of OAT over MF for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. We found that only 52% of MF athletes could return to sports at the preinjury level. Limitations of our study included a small number of athletes and a relatively short (3-year) follow-up. A long-term follow-up is needed to assess the durability of articular cartilage repair using these methods in young active athletes. <b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level I, Therapeutic study, randomized controlled trial, significant difference (a).",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.201600373,"Tough, Semisynthetic Hydrogels for Adipose Derived Stem Cell Delivery for Chondral Defect Repair","Cell-based therapies have great potential to regenerate and repair injured articular cartilage, and a range of synthetic and natural polymer-based hydrogels have been used in combination with stem cells and growth factors for this purpose. Although the hydrogel scaffolds developed to date possess many favorable characteristics, achieving the required mechanical properties has remained a challenge. A hydrogel system with tunable mechanical properties, composed of a mixture of natural and synthetic polymers, and its use for the encapsulation of adipose derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) is described. Solutions of methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (MCS) are mixed with solutions of acrylate-poly(trimethylene carbonate)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(trimethylene carbonate)-acrylate (PEG-(PTMC-A)2 ) in phosphate buffered saline and crosslinked via thermally initiated free radical polymerization. The hydrogel compressive equilibrium moduli and toughness are readily tailored by varying the concentration of the pre-polymers, as well as the molecular weight of the PEG used to prepare the PEG-(PTMC-A)2 . Two peptide sequences, GVOGEA and GGGGRGDS, are individually conjugated to the MCS to facilitate cell binding. The presence of the peptide ligands yields high ASC viability and long term metabolic activity following encapsulation in hydrogels prepared using the thermal initiator system. Overall, these hydrogels show promise as a minimally invasive ASC delivery strategy for chondral defect repair.",0

Forty-one patients (mean age, 35 years; 30 men, 11 women) underwent ACI for treatment of femoral condylar defects. One year later, knee joint MR imaging and graft biopsy were performed. Graft biopsy results were categorized into those showing hyaline, mixed fibrohyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and fibrous tissue. Standard T1-, T2-, T2*-, and intermediate-weighted sequences were performed, as well as three-dimensional (3D) fast low-angle shot (FLASH) and double-echo steady-state sequences for cartilage assessment. ACI grafts were assessed for signal intensity (with FLASH sequence), thickness, overgrowth, surface smoothness, integration to adjacent cartilage and underlying bone, bone marrow edema underneath graft, and contour of bone underneath graft. MR images were assessed by two observers, first independently and then in consensus. MR imaging findings were correlated with histologic findings.All 41 grafts were present at 1-year follow-up. The graft consisted of hyaline cartilage in four, mixed fibrohyaline cartilage in 10, fibrocartilage in 25, and fibrous tissue in two cases. Graft signal intensity was virtually always lower than adjacent normal cartilage signal intensity, and there was no relationship between graft signal intensity and histologic appearance (P = .34). Graft thickness (P = .83), overgrowth (P = .69), surface smoothness (P = .28), and integration with adjacent cartilage and underlying bone (P = .90); edema in bone marrow underneath graft (P = .63); and bone contour underneath graft (P = .94) at MR imaging had no correlation with graft histologic appearance. Graft overgrowth (n = 16; 39%) and edema-like signal in bone marrow underneath graft (n = 23; 56%) were common. The origin of graft overgrowth remains unclear.With the methods presented here, MR imaging findings cannot predict ACI graft histologic features, and graft histologic appearance determined at biopsy was not related to graft signal intensity, graft thickness, overgrowth, surface smoothness, integration with adjacent cartilage or underlying bone, signal intensity change in underlying bone marrow, or underlying bone contour. Overgrowth and bone marrow changes underneath the graft were common.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516648700,Fresh Osteochondral Allograft Versus Autograft,"Background: Osteochondral autografts and allografts have been widely used in the treatment of isolated grade 4 articular cartilage lesions of the knee. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding the basic science investigating the direct comparison between fresh osteochondral allografts to autografts. Hypothesis: At 12 months, fresh osteochondral allografts are equal to autografts with respect to function, bony incorporation into host bone, and chondrocyte viability. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Eight adult mongrel dogs underwent bilateral hindlimb osteochondral graft implantation in the knee after creation of an acute Outerbridge grade 4 cartilage defect. One hindlimb of each dog knee received an autograft, and the contralateral knee received an allograft. All dogs were sacrificed at 12 months. Graft analysis included gross examination, radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biomechanical testing, and histology. Results: MRI demonstrated excellent bony incorporation of both autografts and allografts, except for 1 allograft that revealed partial incorporation. Histologic examination of cartilage showed intact hyaline appearance for both autografts and allografts, with fibrocartilage at the host-graft interface of both. Biomechanical testing demonstrated no significant difference between allografts and autografts ( P = .76). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between allografts and the native cartilage with biomechanical testing ( P = .84). Conclusion: After 12 months from time of implantation, fresh osteochondral allograft tissue and autograft tissue in this study were not statistically different with respect to biomechanical properties, gross morphology, bony incorporation, or overall histologic characteristics. When compared with the previously reported 6-month incorporation rates, there was improved allograft and autograft incorporation at 12 months. Clinical Relevance: With no significant differences in gross examination, radiographs, MRI, biomechanical testing, or histology in the canine model, the use of allograft tissue to treat osteochondral defects may eliminate the morbidity associated with autograft harvest.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/art.20713,Use of bone morphogenetic protein 2 and diffusion chambers to engineer cartilage tissue for the repair of defects in articular cartilage,"To examine the ability of cartilage-like tissue, generated ectopically in a diffusion chamber using recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rHuBMP-2), to repair cartilage defects in rats.Muscle-derived mesenchymal cells were prepared by dissecting thigh muscles of 19-day postcoital rat embryos. Cells were propagated in vitro in monolayer culture for 10 days and packed within diffusion chambers (10(6)/chamber) together with type I collagen (CI) and 0, 1, or 10 microg rHuBMP-2, and implanted into abdominal subfascial pockets of adult rats. Tissue pellets were harvested from the diffusion chambers at 2 days to 6 weeks after implantation, and examined by histology, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for aggrecan, CII, CIX, CX, and CXI, MyoD1, and core binding factor a1/runt-related gene 2, and by real-time PCR for CII. Tissue pellets generated in the chamber 5 weeks after implantation were transplanted into a full-thickness cartilage defect made in the patellar groove of the same strain of adult rat.In the presence of 10 microg rHuBMP-2, muscle-derived mesenchymal cells expressed CII messenger RNA at 4 days after transplantation, and a mature cartilage mass was formed 5 weeks after transplantation in the diffusion chamber. Cartilage was not formed in the presence of 1 microg rHuBMP-2 or in the absence of rHuBMP-2. Defects receiving cartilage engineered with 10 microg rHuBMP-2 were repaired and restored to normal morphologic condition within 6 months after transplantation.This method of tissue engineering for repair of articular defects may preclude the need to harvest cartilage tissue prior to mosaic arthroplasty or autologous chondrocyte implantation. Further studies in large animals will be necessary to validate this technique for application in clinical practice.",0

We hypothesized that dispersed chitosan particles implanted close to the bone marrow degrade in situ in a molecular mass-dependent manner, and attract more stromal cells to the site in aged rabbits compared to the blood clot in untreated controls.Three microdrill hole defects, 1.4 mm diameter and 2 mm deep, were created in both knee trochlea of 30 month-old New Zealand White rabbits. Each of 3 isotonic chitosan solutions (150, 40, 10 kDa, 80% degree of deaceylation, with fluorescent chitosan tracer) was mixed with autologous rabbit whole blood, clotted with tissue factor to form cylindrical implants, and press-fit in drill holes in the left knee while contralateral holes received tissue factor or no treatment. At day 1 or day 21 post-operative, defects were analyzed by micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and stereology for bone and soft tissue repair.All 3 implants filled the top of defects at day 1 and were partly degraded in situ at 21 days post-operative. All implants attracted neutrophils, osteoclasts and abundant bone marrow-derived stromal cells, stimulated bone resorption followed by new woven bone repair (bone remodeling) and promoted repair tissue-bone integration. 150 kDa chitosan implant was less degraded, and elicited more apoptotic neutrophils and bone resorption than 10 kDa chitosan implant. Drilled controls elicited a poorly integrated fibrous or fibrocartilaginous tissue.Pre-solidified implants elicit stromal cells and vigorous bone plate remodeling through a phase involving neutrophil chemotaxis. Pre-solidified chitosan implants are tunable by molecular mass, and could be beneficial for augmented marrow stimulation therapy if the recruited stromal cells can progress to bone and cartilage repair.",0

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 months after ACI and was evaluated by the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).MOCART scores showed improvements after 3 months, with slight dose dependence, and further improvement after 12 months, although without significant dose dependence. The mean MOCART scores after 3 months (0 = worst, 100 = best) were 59.8, 64.5, and 64.7 for the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups, respectively, and 62.9 for all patients; at 12 months, these were 74.1, 74.5, and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for all patients. Several MOCART items (surface of repair tissue, structure of repair tissue, signal intensity of repair tissue, subchondral bone, and synovitis) showed a more rapid response with the medium and high doses than with the low dose, suggesting a potential dose relationship. No significant correlation between the MOCART (overall and subscores) with clinical outcomes as assessed by the overall KOOS was detected at 3- and 12-month assessments.This study reveals a trend toward earlier recovery after treatment with higher spheroid doses in terms of better defect filling for full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee, while outcomes after 12 months were similar in all dose groups. However, a correlation with clinical outcomes or the failure rate at 1 year after ACI was not found. A longer follow-up will be required for more definite conclusions on the clinical relevance of ACI cell density to be drawn.NCT01225575 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier); 2009-016816-20 (EudraCT number).",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10561-016-9577-2,Ex vivo and in vivo characterization of cold preserved cartilage for cell transplantation,"Due to the inconvenient and invasive nature of chondrocyte transplantation, preserved cartilage has been recognized as an alternative source of chondrocytes for implantation. However, there are major concerns, in particular, the viability and quality of the chondrocytes. This study investigated the biochemistry and molecular characterization of chondrocytes isolated from preserved cartilage for purposes of transplantation. Ex vivo characterization was accomplished by storing human cartilage at either 4 or -80 A degrees C in a preservation medium. Microscopic evaluation of the preserved cartilage was conducted after 1, 2, 3 and 6 weeks. The chondrocytes were isolated from the preserved cartilage and investigated for proliferation capacity and chondrogenic phenotype. Transplantation of chondrocytes from preserved cartilage into rabbit knees was performed for purposes of in vivo evaluation. The serum cartilage degradation biomarker (WF6 epitopes) was evaluated during the transplantation procedure. Human cartilage preserved for 1 week in a 10 % DMSO chondrogenic medium at 4 A degrees C gave the highest chondrocyte viability. The isolated chondrocytes showed a high proliferative capacity and retained chondrogenic gene expression. Microscopic assessment of the implanted rabbit knees showed tissue regeneration and integration with the host cartilage. A decreased level of the serum biomarker after transplantation was evidence of in vivo repair by the implanted chondrocytes. These results suggest that cartilage preservation for 1 week in a 10 % DMSO chondrogenic medium at 4 A degrees C can maintain proliferation capacity and the chondrogenic phenotype of human chondrocytes. These results can potentially be applied to in vivo allogeneic chondrocyte transplantation. Allogeneic chondrocytes from preserved cartilage would be expected to maintain their chondrogenic phenotype and to result in a high rate of success in transplanted grafts.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603516678973,The Effect of Growth Hormone on Chondral Defect Repair,"Objective Focal chondral defects alter joint mechanics and cause pain and debilitation. Microfracture is a surgical technique used to treat such defects. This technique involves penetration of subchondral bone to release progenitor cells and growth factors from the marrow to promote cartilage regeneration. Often this results in fibrocartilage formation rather than structured hyaline cartilage. Some reports have suggested use of growth hormone (GH) with microfracture to augment cartilage regeneration. Our objective was to test whether intra-articular (IA) GH in conjunction with microfracture, improves cartilage repair in a rabbit chondral defect model. We hypothesized that GH would exhibit a dose-dependent improvement in regeneration. Design Sixteen New Zealand white rabbits received bilateral femoral chondral defects and standardized microfracture repair. One group of animals ( n = 8) received low-dose GH by IA injection in the left knee, and the other group ( n = 8) received high-dose GH in the same manner. All animals received IA injection of saline in the contralateral knee as control. Serum assays, macroscopic grading, and histological analyses were used to assess any improvements in cartilage repair. Results Peripheral serum GH was not elevated postoperatively ( P = 0.21). There was no improvement in macroscopic grading scores among either of the GH dosages ( P = 0.83). Scoring of safranin-O-stained sections showed no improvement in cartilage regeneration and some evidence of increased bone formation in the GH-treated knees. Conclusions Treatment with either low- or high-dose IA GH does not appear to enhance short-term repair in a rabbit chondral defect model.",0

The expression of cartilage-specific genes (col II, aggrecan, and Sox9) and fibroblast growth factor receptor genes was tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction in vitro. Also, full-thickness cartilage defects (diameter 4 mm, thickness 3 mm) were created in New Zealand white rabbits and untreated (group I), or treated with a bilayer collagen scaffold (group II) or BMP-4 with scaffold (group III) (n = 12/group). The repaired tissues were harvested for histology and mechanical testing after 6 or 12 weeks.Cartilage differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells was more apparent after BMP-4 treatment, as evidenced by higher expression of type II collagen and aggrecan genes. Also, BMP-4 induced higher aggrecan and fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 gene expression in chondrocytes, whereas BMP-7 had no effect. In the in vivo experiments, group III treated with BMP-4 protein had the largest amounts of cartilage tissue, which restored a greater surface area of the defect and achieved higher International Cartilage Repair Society scores. Moreover, Young's modulus, which indicates the mechanical properties of the repaired tissue, was markedly higher in group III than in groups I and II (p < 0.05), but lower than in normal tissue.BMP-4 is more potent than BMP-7 for cartilage differentiation. The delivery of BMP-4 protein in a bilayer collagen scaffold stimulates the formation of cartilage tissue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-020-01909-y,MicroRNA-27b targets CBFB to inhibit differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into hypertrophic chondrocytes,"Abstract Background Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) have chondrocyte differentiation potential and are considered to be a cell source for cell-transplantation-mediated repair of cartilage defects, including those associated with osteoarthritis (OA). However, chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation is a major obstacle for the application of hBMSCs in articular cartilage defect treatment. We have previously shown that microRNA-27b (miR-27b) inhibits hypertrophy of chondrocytes from rat knee cartilage. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-27b in chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation of hBMSCs. Methods Chondrogenic marker and microRNA expression in hBMSC chondrogenic pellets were evaluated using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The hBMSCs were transfected with miR-27b before inducing differentiation. Gene and protein expression levels were analyzed using RT-qPCR and western blot. Coimmunoprecipitation was used to confirm interaction between CBFB and RUNX2. Luciferase reporter assays were used to demonstrate that CBFB is a miR-27b target. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated in hBMSCs treated with shRNA targeting CBFB . Chondrogenic hBMSC pellets overexpressing miR-27b were implanted into cartilage lesions in model rats; therapeutic effects were assessed based on histology and immunohistochemistry. Results The hBMSCs showed typical MSC differentiation potentials. During chondrogenic differentiation, collagen 2 and 10 ( COL2 and COL10 ), SOX9 , and RUNX2 expression was upregulated. Expression of miR-140, miR-143, and miR-181a increased over time, whereas miR-27b and miR-221 were downregulated. Cartilage derived from hBMSC and overexpressing miR-27b exhibited higher expression of COL2 and SOX9 , but lower expression of COL10 , RUNX2 , and CBFB than did the control cartilage. CBFB and RUNX2 formed a complex, and CBFB was identified as a novel miR-27b target. CBFB knockdown by shRNA during hBMSC chondrogenic differentiation led to significantly increased COL2 and SOX9 expression and decreased COL10 expression. Finally, miR-27b-overexpressing hBMSC chondrogenic pellets had better hyaline cartilage morphology and reduced expression of hypertrophic markers and tend to increase repair efficacy in vivo. Conclusion MiR-27b plays an important role in preventing hypertrophic chondrogenesis of hBMSCs by targeting CBFB and is essential for maintaining a hyaline cartilage state. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of hBMSC chondrocyte differentiation and will aid in the development of strategies for treating cartilage injury based on hBMSC transplantation.",0

https://doi.org/10.2741/4741,One-step strategy for chondral defect repair,"One-step clinical therapies of articular cartilage defects remains a challenge. In this study, a strategy was proposed to utilize type II collagen (Col-II) gels with autologous bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) embedded to repair full-thickness chondral defects. Its feasibility and efficacy were further assessed in a minipig model. An 8-mm full-thickness chondral defect was created on the femoral trochlea of two knees in Guizhou minipigs. One knee received Col-II gels with BMDCs implantation versus the untreated one as control. After 1, 3, and 6 months operation, the animals were sacrificed, and the repair outcomes of chondral defects were evaluated using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), macro- and microscopic observation, and histological analysis. The treatment group showed significantly better repair outcomes of chondral defects than that in the control group at each time point (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the image showed that the repaired tissue in the treatment group was more similar to the surrounding healthy cartilage tissue. Based on the hyaline-like tissue regenerated ability, this one-step strategy provides a promising therapeutic potential for clinical application.",0

Partial meniscectomy treated with meniscal substitutes may delay articular cartilage degeneration.To evaluate the status of articular cartilage by T2 mapping after meniscal substitution with polyurethane scaffolds enriched with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and comparison with acellular scaffolds at 12 months.Seventeen patients (18-50 years) with past meniscectomies were enrolled in 2 groups: (1) acellular polyurethane scaffold (APS) or (2) polyurethane scaffold enriched with MSC (MPS). Patients in the MPS group received filgrastim to stimulate MSC production, and CD90+ cells were obtained and cultured in the polyurethane scaffold. The scaffolds were implanted arthroscopically into partial meniscus defects. Concomitant injuries (articular cartilage lesions or cartilage lesions) were treated during the same procedure. Changes in the quality of articular cartilage were evaluated with T2 mapping in femur and tibia at 12 months.In tibial T2 mapping, values for the MPS group increased slightly at 9 months but returned to initial values at 12 months (P > 0.05). In the APS group, a clear decrease from 3 months to 12 months was observed (P > 0.05). This difference tended to be significantly lower in the APS group compared with the MPS group at the final time point (P = 0.18). In the femur, a slight increase in the MPS group (47.8 ± 3.4) compared with the APS group (45.3 ± 4.9) was observed (P > 0.05).Meniscal substitution with polyurethane scaffold maintains normal T2 mapping values in adjacent cartilage at 12 months. The addition of MSC did not show any advantage in the protection of articular cartilage over acellular scaffolds (P > 0.05).",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/rb/rbab038,Magnetic resonance imaging for non-invasive clinical evaluation of normal and regenerated cartilage,"Abstract With the development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, it is much desired to establish bioimaging techniques to monitor the real-time regeneration efficacy in vivo in a non-invasive way. Herein, we tried magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate knee cartilage regeneration after implanting a biomaterial scaffold seeded with chondrocytes, namely, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI). After summary of the T2 mapping and the T1-related delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) in vitro and in vivo in the literature, these two MRI techniques were tried clinically. In this study, 18 patients were followed up for 1 year. It was found that there was a significant difference between the regeneration site and the neighboring normal site (control), and the difference gradually diminished with regeneration time up to 1 year according to both the quantitative T1 and T2 MRI methods. We further established the correlation between the quantitative evaluation of MRI and the clinical Lysholm scores for the first time. Hence, the MRI technique was confirmed to be a feasible semi-quantitative yet non-invasive way to evaluate the in vivo regeneration of knee articular cartilage.",0

Only those children with grade 3 or 4 (OCD) in the medial or lateral femoral condyle (according to International Cartilage Repair Society, ICRS) were included in the study. Forty-seven patients (94%) were available for follow-up. There were 25 patients in the OAT group and 22 patients in the MF group. The mean duration of symptoms was 23.54+/-4.24 months and the mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range from 3 to 6 y), and none of the children had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. Children were evaluated using ICRS score, x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and second-look arthroscopies.After 1 year, both groups had significant clinical improvement (P<0.05) and the ICRS functional and objective assessment showed that 23 of 25 (92%) patients had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 19 of 22 (86%) after MF (NS), but 19 of 23 (83%) after OAT and only 12 of 19 (63%) after MF procedure maintained excellent or good results after 4.2 years (range from 3 to 6 y). The MF group showed significant deterioration over the 4.2 years follow-up (P<0.05), but still had significant clinical improvement compared with pretreatment evaluation (P=0.004). There were 9 of 22 (41%) failures in the MF group, and none in the OAT group. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation according to the ICRS evaluation system showed excellent or good repairs in 19 of 21 patients (91%) after OAT compared with 10 of 18 (56%) after MF.At an average of 4.2 years follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in children under the age of 18 years has shown significant superiority of the mosaic-type OAT over MF for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans defects in the knee.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2006.11.009,MRI and clinical evaluation of collagen-covered autologous chondrocyte implantation (CACI) at two years,"We present our experience with the collagen-covered autologous chondrocyte implantation (CACI) technique. Thirty two implantations were performed in 31 patients. Clinical outcome was measured using the KOOS score and the 6-minute walk test, as well as an MRI scoring protocol (75% of patients had a complete data set for MRI follow-up) to describe the repair tissue generated by CACI. We have also correlated our MRI results with our clinical outcome. To the authors knowledge there are no comparative studies of MRI and clinical outcome following CACI in the current literature. Patients demonstrated an increased walk distance that improved significantly from 3 months to 24 months postoperatively (p<0.05). Analysis of the KOOS results demonstrated a significant (p<0.05) improvement in four of the five subscales from 3 months to 24 months after CACI, with the most substantial gains made in the first 12 months. Patients demonstrated an increased MRI outcome score over time that improved significantly from 3 months to 24 months postoperatively (p<0.05). We observed an 8% incidence of hypertrophic growth following CACI. We report one partial graft failure, defined by clinical, MRI and histological evaluation, at the one year time point. In contrast to the current literature we report no incidence of manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) following CACI. This research demonstrates that autologous chondrocytes implanted under a type I/III collagen patch regenerates a functional infill material, and as a result of this procedure, patients experienced improved knee function and MRI scores. Whilst our results indicated a statistically significant relationship between the MRI and functional outcome following CACI, MRI cannot be used as surrogate measure of functional outcome following CACI, since the degree of association was only low to moderate. That is, functional outcome following CACI cannot be predicted by the morphological MRI assessment of the repair tissue at the post-surgery time points to 24 months.",0

Once injured, it cannot be repaired, typically leading to high risk for developing osteoarthritis. Thus, cell-based and/or tissue-engineered approaches have been investigated; however, no approach has yet achieved safety and regenerative repair capacity via a simple implantation procedure.To assess the safety and efficacy of using a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from autologous synovial membrane mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for effective cartilage repair.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Five patients with symptomatic knee chondral lesions (1.5-3.0 cm2) on the medial femoral condyle, lateral femoral condyle, or femoral groove were included. Synovial MSCs were isolated from arthroscopic biopsy specimens and cultured to develop a TEC that matched the lesion size. The TECs were then implanted into chondral defects without fixation and assessed up to 24 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was the safety of the procedure. Secondary outcomes were self-assessed clinical scores, arthroscopy, tissue biopsy, and magnetic resonance image-based estimation of morphologic and compositional quality of the repair tissue.No adverse events were recorded, and self-assessed clinical scores for pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sports activity, and quality of life were significantly improved at 24 months after surgery. Secure defect filling was confirmed by second-look arthroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging in all cases. Histology of biopsy specimens indicated repair tissue approaching the composition and structure of hyaline cartilage.Autologous scaffold-free TEC derived from synovial MSCs may be used for regenerative cartilage repair via a sutureless and simple implantation procedure.

In vitro experiments have shown that the application of synthetic scaffolds is a promising alternative to existing therapeutic options. A sheep study was conducted to test the suitability of microporous pure β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramics as tissue engineering scaffolds for the repair of osteochondral defects. Cylindrical plugs of microporous β-TCP (diameter: 7mm; length: 25mm; porosity: 43.5±2.4%; pore diameter: ~5μm) with interconnecting pores were used. Scaffolds were seeded with autologous chondrocytes in vitro and cultured for 4weeks. A drill hole (diameter 7mm) was placed in both medial femoral condyles of sheep. For the left knee the defect was filled with a TCP plug and for the right knee the defect was left empty. After 6, 12, 26 and 52weeks, seven animals from each group were killed and studied. The samples were examined employing histological, histomorphometric and immunohistological methods as well as various imaging techniques (X-ray, microcomputer tomography and scanning electron microscopy). After explantation the cartilage defects were first assessed macroscopically. There were no signs of infection or inflammation. Histological grading scales were used for assessment of bony integration and cartilage repair. An increasing degradation (81% after 52weeks) of the ceramic with concomitant bone formation was observed. The original structure of cancellous bone was almost completely restored. After 26 and 52weeks, collagen II-positive hyaline cartilage was detected in several samples. New subchondral bone had formed. The formation of cartilage began at the outer edge and proceeded to the middle. According to the O'Driscoll score, values corresponding to healthy cartilage were not reached after 1year. Integration of the newly formed cartilage tissue into the surrounding native cartilage was found. The formation of biomechanical stable cartilage began at the edge and progressed towards the centre of the defect. After 1year this process was still not completed. Microporous β-TCP scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes are suitable for the treatment of osteochondral defects.",0

MATERIAL AND METHODS:Porous PLGA scaffolds were prepared in a bilayered manner to reflect the structure of chondral and subchondral bone. Bone defects, measuring 4 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness, were created in both knee joints in 18 healthy New Zealand white rabbits, aged between 120–180 days old. Rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: rabbits with bone defects implanted with bilayer PLGA scaffolds (PLGA group) (N=6); or with bilayer PLGA and autologous PRP (PLGA/PRP group) (N=6); and the untreated group (control group) (N=6). The gross morphology, histology, and immunohistochemistry for the expression of collagen type II and aggrecan were observed at 12 weeks after surgery and compared using a scoring system. Micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging and relative expression of specific genes were also assessed. RESULTS:The platelet concentrations in the PRP samples were found to be 4.9 times greater than that of whole blood samples. The total score on gross appearance and histology was greatest in the PLGA/PRP group, as was the expression of collagen II and aggrecan of the neo-tissue. Micro-CT imaging showed that more subchondral bone was formed in the PLGA/PRP group. CONCLUSIONS:Bilayer PLGA scaffolds loaded with autologous PRP improve the reconstruction of osteochondral defects in the rabbit model.",0

The clinical examination included the Knee Society Score (KSS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. The radiographic examination included the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading scale. A comparison analysis of the clinical preoperative and follow-up data and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed.ResultsOf the 64 UniCAP patients, 36 (56%) were revised and one died. Examinations were performed on 23 (85%) of them. When compared with the preoperative data, the examinations showed a significant increase in the KSS objective [mean=47.4, standard deviation (SD)=5.8 vs. mean=90.0, SD=6.9] and function (mean=46.7, SD=6.8 vs. mean=91.1, SD=6.9) scores, a decrease in the VAS-score (mean=7.3, SD=0.5 vs. mean=3.4, SD=1.4) and a significant increase in the KL medial score (mean=1.7, SD=0.6 vs. mean=2.1, SD=0.5).

The mean preoperative clinical outcome percentage (based on percentage of outcome scale used) was 37% (standard deviation [SD], 18.9%) and the mean postoperative clinical outcome percentage was 72.7% (SD, 16.9%). The overall percentage increase in clinical outcome scores was 35.7% (SD, 14.2%). Mean CMS was 47.8 (SD, 8.3).Cartilage repair in adolescent knees using ACI provides success across different clinical outcomes measures. The only patient- or lesion-specific factor that influenced clinical outcome was the shorter duration of preoperative symptoms.Level IV, systemic review of Level I-IV studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2017.0223,A cost-effective cell- and matrix-based minimally invasive single-stage chondroregenerative technique developed with validated vertical translation methodology,"Introduction The morbidity and significant health economic impact associated with the chondral lesion has led to a large number of strategies for therapeutic neochondrogenesis. The challenge has been to develop techniques that are cost effective single-stage procedures with minimal surgical trauma that have undergone rigorous preclinical scrutiny and robust reproducible assessment of effectiveness. A biological repair requires the generation of a cellular and matrix composite with appropriate signalling for chondrogenic differentiation. Methods and results A technique was developed that allowed chondrogenic primary (uncultured) cells from bone marrow aspirate concentrate, combined with a composite hydrophilic and fibrillar matrix to be applied arthroscopically to a site of a chondral lesion. The construct was tested in vitro and in animal experiments before clinical trials. Clinical trials involved 60 patients in a prospective study. Symptomatic International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 and 4a lesions were mapped and treated. Pre- and postoperative clinical assessments showed statistically significant improved outcomes; Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (mean 52.8 to &gt; 76.4; P &lt; 0.05) International Knee Documentation Committee (mean 39 to &gt; 79 P &lt; 0.05) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (64.5 to &gt;89.2 P &lt; 0.05). Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated morphologically (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue, average MOCART score 72) and qualitatively; the regenerate was comparable to native cartilage. Conclusions This technique is effective, affordable, requires no complex tools and delivers a single-stage treatment that is potentially accessible to any centre capable of performing arthroscopic surgery. Good clinical results were found to be sustained at five years of follow-up with a regenerate that appears hyaline like using multiple magnetic resonance measures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10195-015-0383-6,Long-term clinical results and MRI changes after autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee of young and active middle aged patients,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) represents a valid surgical option for symptomatic full-thickness chondral lesions of the knee. Here we report long-term clinical and MRI results of first-generation ACI.Fifteen patients (mean age 21.3 years) underwent first-generation ACI for symptomatic chondral defects of the knee between 1997 and 2001. The mean size of the lesions was 5.08 cm(2) (range 2-9 cm(2)). Patients were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Examination Form, the Tegner Activity Scale, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). High-resolution MRI was used to analyze the repair tissue with nine variables (the MOCART scoring system).The mean follow-up period was 148 months (range 125-177 months). ACI resulted in substantial improvements in all clinical outcome parameters, even as much as 12 years after implantation. A significant decrease in the MOCART score was recorded at final measurement. Reoperation was required in 2 patients; failure was caused by partial detachment of the graft in both cases.Autologous chondrocyte implantation is an effective and durable solution for the treatment of large, full-thickness cartilage and osteochondral lesions, even in young and active middle-aged patients. High-resolution MRI is a useful and noninvasive method for evaluating the repaired tissue.IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1053/j.otsm.2014.09.006,Talar Osteochondral Defects: Current Techniques,"Osteochondral defects (OCDs) of the talus are an increasingly recognized common injury and may occur in up to 50% of ankle sprains and fractures. There is a consensus regarding nonoperative management of asymptomatic OCDs of the talus. Surgery is often indicated in symptomatic cases and multiple techniques have been proposed, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Acute OCDs are usually treated by excision particularly if the fragment is small, displaced, or comminuted. If the fragment is large with a cartilage surface intact, repair may be attempted, particularly with an anterolateral location. In chronic lesions, most authors consider nonoperative management as the standard first-line approach for nondisplaced lesions. Initial surgical treatment usually consists of debridement, curettage, or microfracture to obtain a stable bleeding base. Failed initial debridement is an indication for resurfacing, with osteoarticular cartilage transfer or mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation, or similar techniques using cartilage fragments or scaffolds performed as initial options. Generally, osteochondral allograft transplantation is considered as a salvage procedure, or for large lesions with significant bone loss that cannot be treated successfully with other resurfacing techniques.",0

Gelatin microspheres loaded with TGF-beta1 (MS-TGFbeta1) showed a fast release at the initial phase (37.4%), and the ultimate accumulated release was 83.1% by day 18. The autologous MSCs seeded on MS-TGFbeta1/scaffold were implanted to repair full-thickness cartilage defects in rabbits as in vivo differentiation repair group, while MSCs differentiated in vitro were seeded on scaffold without MS-TGFbeta1 to repair the contra lateral cartilage defects (n = 30). Fifteen additional rabbits without treatment for defects were used as control. Histology observation showed that the in vivo differentiation repair group had better chondrocyte morphology, integration, continuous subchondral bone, and much thicker newly formed cartilage layer when compared to in vitro differentiation repair group 12 and 24 weeks, postoperatively. There was a significant difference in histological grading score between these two experimental groups, and both showed much better repair than that of the control. The present study implied that the novel scaffold with MS-TGFbeta1 might serve as a new way to induce the differentiation of MSCs in vivo to enhance the cartilage repair.",0

To overcome the disadvantages of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and to improve the outcomes of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC), the latter technique is currently augmented with bone marrow concentrate injected under or seeded onto the scaffold. However, to date, only a little is known about histological outcomes of either the AMIC technique or AMIC associated with bone marrow concentrate. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of the repair tissue obtained from biopsies harvested during second-look arthroscopy after arthroscopic AMIC augmented with bone marrow concentrate. We analysed five second-look core biopsies harvested at 12 months follow-up. At the time of biopsy the surgeon reported the quality of the repair tissue using the standard ICRS Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA). Every biopsy together with patient data was sent to our centre to undergo blind histological evaluation (ICRS II Visual Histological Assessment Scale) and data analysis. Five asymptomatic patients (mean age 43.4 years) had isolated lesions (mean size was 3.7 cm2) at the medial femoral condyle. All the implants appeared nearly normal (ICRS CRA) at arthroscopic evaluation and had a mean overall histological (ICRS II) of 59.8±14,5. Hyaline-like matrix was found in only one case, a mixture of hyaline/fibrocartilage was found in one case and fibrocartilage was found three cases. Our clinical and histological data suggest that this procedure achieved a nearly normal arthroscopic appearance and a satisfactory repair tissue, which was possibly still maturing at 12 months follow-up. Further studies are needed to understand the true potential of one-step procedures in the repair of focal chondral lesions in the knee.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2702-x,Evolution of C-reactive protein values in the first month after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: reference values,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is often used as an infection marker in orthopaedic patients and in particular after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The aim of this study is to obtain the reference values of CRP during the first month after an ACL reconstruction and to analyse the epidemiological and surgical parameters that affect these values. One hundred and twenty ACL reconstructions were included. A CRP determination was performed preoperatively and 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after surgery. CRP values under 5 mg/l were considered to be normal. One patient developed a septic arthritis in the second week postoperatively and was excluded. One hundred and seventeen patients [93 males and 24 females; mean age (standard deviation) 31.6 years (7.6)] underwent 119 ACL reconstructions with different techniques and grafts. Preoperative CRP (n = 119) was 1.80 mg/ml (2.6). Mean values at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days were, respectively, 8.5 mg/ml (11.6), 10.5 mg/ml (17.0), 4.5 mg/ml (3.43), 4.4 mg/ml (7.59) and 3.4 mg/ml (3.03). Multivariate analysis showed that males had postoperative CRP levels 1.7 higher than females (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0001; 95 % CI 1.8-2.5); the patients operated by less experienced surgeons had levels 2.5 times higher than those operated by a highly experienced surgeons (p = 0.007; 95 % CI 1.2-3.4) and that if microfracture of a chondral lesion was associated, the levels increased 1.9 times (p = 0.021; 95 % CI 1.1-3.4). There are significant variations in CRP levels after ACL reconstruction in half of patients without infectious complications. Males, patients operated by less experienced surgeons and those with chondral lesions treated with microfracture had increased postoperative CRP levels. CRP values up to five times the normal limit are common in the month after an ACL reconstruction and are not necessarily associated with infection, especially in these groups.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.008,Treatment of articular cartilage defects in horses with polymer-based cartilage tissue engineering grafts,"The objective of our study was to evaluate the integration of autologous cartilage tissue engineering transplants based on resorbable polyglactin/polydioxanone scaffolds into full-thickness cartilage defects of horses. Cartilage biopsies were taken from the non-load-bearing area of the lateral talus of the left tibiotarsal joint of eight healthy Haflinger horses. Tissue engineering cartilage transplants were generated by three-dimensional arrangement of autologous chondrocytes in biocompatible and resorbable polymer scaffolds. Full-thickness cartilage defects of 8 mm in diameter were created in the tubular bone condyle of the fetlock joint and cartilage grafts were fixed using an anchor system, while defects without grafting served as controls. After 6 and 12 months the repair tissue was evaluated histologically and showed formation of a cartilaginous tissue and good integration into the surrounding host tissue with firm bonding of the graft to the adjacent cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the content of glycosaminoglycans and hydroxyproline is comparable in repair tissue derived from treated and control defects. The use of three-dimensional autologous cartilage transplants based on resorbable polymer scaffolds ensures secure fixation, good integration of the graft into cartilage lesions, and is therefore suggested as a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of cartilage defects.",0

The average age was 31 years (range 15-45 years), including 12 females and 7 males. Patients were prospectively followed using validated clinical outcome measures including Veterans RAND 12-item Health Survey (VR-12), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the Tegner activity scale. Graft incorporation was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or second-look arthroscopy.The cartilage defects included the patella (n = 16) and the femoral trochlea (n = 3). Mean VR-12 scores increased from 31.6 to 46.3 (P < 0.01), mean IKDC increased from 40.0 to 69.7 (P < 0.01), mean KOOS increased from 53.9 to 80.2 (P < 0.01), and mean Tegner scores increased from 3.0 to 4.9 (P < 0.01), at average follow-up of 41.9 months (range 24-62 months). Of the 3 patients who underwent second-look arthroscopy, all demonstrated a well-incorporated graft. Mean MOCART score for the 6 patients with follow-up MRI was 62.5 (range 25-85). The reoperation rate was 21.1% and 2 patients (12.5%) experienced progressive patellofemoral osteoarthritis requiring conversion to patellofemoral arthroplasty.Patients with unipolar cartilage defects involving the patellofemoral compartment of the knee can have positive outcomes at minimum 2-year follow-up after surgical treatment with a cryopreserved osteochondral allograft when concomitant pathology is also addressed, but the reoperation rate is high and bipolar cartilage lesions may increase the failure rate.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2007.01.012,Sequential Changes in Implanted Cartilage After Autologous Osteochondral Transplantation: Postoperative Acoustic Properties up to 1 Year in an In Vivo Rabbit Model,"<b>Purpose:</b> For successful autologous osteochondral transplantation, it is important that the cartilage in an implanted plug provide histologic replacement of damaged cartilage with cartilage that is structurally and mechanically normal. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the press-fit technique reconstructs the normal hyaline cartilage and provides acoustic stiffness equal to that of normal intact cartilage. <b>Methods:</b> In 36 rabbits an osteochondral plug, 6 mm in diameter, was removed from the right patellar groove and grafted into a recipient hole, 5 mm in diameter, in the left patellar groove. Specimens at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 52 weeks postoperatively were assessed by macroscopic and histologic observation and by use of an ultrasonic system. The ultrasonic acoustic stiffness, acoustic surface irregularity, and acoustic thickness of the implanted cartilage were examined and compared with normal intact cartilage. <b>Results:</b> The gross appearance of the implanted cartilage was glossy, maintained good surface smoothness, and survived well throughout the observation period. The cartilage recovered histologic features of hyaline cartilage. The acoustic stiffness decreased up to 12 weeks and then increased at 24 and 52 weeks after surgery. The acoustic stiffness at 8 or 12 weeks was significantly lower (acoustically softer) than that of control cartilage (<i>P</i> < .001). The acoustic stiffness at 52 weeks was equal to that of the control. The difference in acoustic surface irregularity was not significant. The acoustic thickness at 8 weeks was higher (acoustically thicker) than that of the control (<i>P</i> < .01). <b>Conclusions:</b> Although the reason acoustically soft cartilage in plugs becomes acoustically stiff and whether the histology of the implanted cartilage had recovered completely remain unclear, the acoustic stiffness recovered to normal control values by 52 weeks postoperatively. <b>Clinical Relevance:</b> Postoperative care for up to 12 weeks should be taken after autologous osteochondral transplantation.",0
,Treatment of full thickness cartilage defects in human knees with Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation.,"Although a variety of strategies have been employed for managing articular cartilage defects in the knee, overall outcomes have not been satisfactory. An alternative option may be autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT). However, as this method is still under investigation, here we assessed the efficacy of ACT for human knee defect cartilage repair.In a randomized clinical trial study, eleven patients (mean age 31.09 years) were enrolled in the study with full thickness cartilage defects in the knee. Arthroscopically, healthy cartilage was obtained, chondrocytes expanded for 2-3 weeks and ACT performed. Clinical status was evaluated before ACT, 6 and 12 months after ACT using the Brittberg-Peterson functional assessment and modified Cincinnati rating score. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were evaluated based on the scoring systems used by Sally Roberts and by Henderson.Modified Cincinnati rating indicated significant improvement of clinical score before ACT compared to 6 (p = 0.000) and 12 (p = 0.000) months after ACT (from 2.73 before ACT to 7.27, 8.36 and 9.5 at 6, 12, and 48 months after ACT, respectively). Brittberg-Peterson functional assessment indicated a decline from 79.27 to 25.82 and 19.27 at 6 and 12 months post ACT. Further, statistical test demonstrated significant differences 6, 12 and 48 months post ACT (p = 0.007). Evaluation of MRI revealed a score of 6.5 for Henderson criteria and a score of 2.5 for Robert criteria.Our study demonstrated that ACT of the knee provides an excellent treatment for full thickness cartilage defects with outstanding clinical and radiological outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1735278,The Large Focal Isolated Chondral Lesion,"Focal chondral defects (FCDs) of the knee can be a debilitating condition that can clinically translate into pain and dysfunction in young patients with high activity demands. Both the understanding of the etiology of FCDs and the surgical management of these chondral defects has exponentially grown in recent years. This is reflected by the number of surgical procedures performed for FCDs, which is now approximately 200,000 annually. This fact is also apparent in the wide variety of available surgical approaches to FCDs. Although simple arthroscopic debridement or microfracture are usually the first line of treatment for smaller lesions, chondral lesions that involve a larger area or depth require restorative procedures such as osteochondral allograft transplantation or other cell-based techniques. Given the prevalence of FCDs and the increased attention on treating these lesions, a comprehensive understanding of management from diagnosis to rehabilitation is imperative for the treating surgeon. This narrative review aims to describe current concepts in the treatment of large FCDs through providing an algorithmic approach to selecting interventions to address these lesions as well as the reported outcomes in the literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/5584_2017_9,Knee Cartilage Regeneration with Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Embedded in Collagen Scaffold Using Dry Arthroscopy Technique,"Articular cartilage injuries lead to progressive degeneration of the joint with subsequent progression to osteoarthritis, which currently becomes a serious health and economic issue. Due to limited capability for self-regeneration, cartilage repair remains a challenge for the present-day orthopedics. Currently, available therapeutic methods fail to provide satisfactory results. A search for other strategies that could regenerate a hyaline-like tissue with a durable effect and adequate mechanical properties is underway. Tissue engineering strategies comprise the use of an appropriately chosen scaffold in combination with seeding cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) provide an interesting new option in regenerative medicine with solid preclinical data and first promising clinical results. They act not only through direct cartilage formation, but also due to paracrine effects, such as releasing trophic factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and promoting angiogenesis. The MSC can be applied in an allogeneic setting without eliciting a host immune response. Out of the various available sources, MSC derived from Wharton's jelly of an umbilical cord seem to have many advantages over their counterparts. This article details a novel, single-staged, and minimally invasive technique for cartilage repair that involves dry arthroscopic implantation of scaffold-embedded allogenic mesenchymal stem cells isolated from umbilical cord Wharton's jelly.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.04.002,Intra-articular delivery of synovium-resident mesenchymal stem cells via BMP-7-loaded fibrous PLGA scaffolds for cartilage repair,"Delivery of synovium-resident mesenchymal stem cells (synMSCs) to cartilage defect site might provide a novel therapeutic modality for treatment of articular cartilage diseases. However, low isolation efficiency of synMSCs limits their therapeutic application. Niche-preserving non-enzymatic isolation of synMSCs was firstly attempted by employing micro-organ culture system based on recapitulating tissue-specific homeostasis ex vivo. The isolated synMSCs retained superior long-term growth competency, proliferation and chondrogenic potential to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). It was noted that synMSCs demonstrated 9-fold increase in cartilaginous micro-tissue formation and 13-fold increase in sulfated proteoglycans deposition compared to BMSCs. For delivery of synMSCs, fibrous PLGA scaffolds were specifically designed for full-thickness osteochondral defects in rabbits. The scaffolds provided effective micro-environment for growth and host-integration of synMSCs. Combined delivery of synMSCs with bone morphogenetic proteins-7 (BMP-7) was designed to achieve synergistic therapeutic efficacy. BMP-7-loaded PLGA nanoparticles electrosprayed onto the scaffolds released BMP-7 over 2 weeks to conform with its aimed role in stimulating early stage endochondral ossification. Scaffold-supported combined administration of synMSCs with BMP-7 resulted in high proteoglycan and collagen type II induction and thick hyaline cartilage formation. Intra-articular co-delivery of synMSCs with BMP-7 via fibrous PLGA scaffolds may be a promising therapeutic modality for articular cartilage repair.",0

Treated areas of the body included the knee, hip, ankle/foot, hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder, and spine. The patients were followed prospectively via enrollment in a treatment registry. Patients were followed prospectively at one, three, six and 12 months, and annually thereafter, using an electronic system, ClinCapture software.A total of 3012 procedures were performed on 2372 patients with follow-up period of 2.2 years. A total of 325 adverse events were reported. The majority were pain post-procedure (n = 93, 3.9 % of the study population) and pain due to progressive degenerative joint disease (n = 90, 3.8 % of the study population). Seven cases reported neoplasms, a lower rate than in the general population. The lowest rate of adverse events was observed among patients injected with BMC alone.Lowest rate of adverse events was among those patients receiving BMC injections alone, but the higher rate of AEs for BMC plus adipose and cultured cells was readily explained by the nature of the therapy or the longer follow-up. There was no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with MSCs of any type in this study increased the risk of neoplasm.",0

Animals were divided into 2 groups, according to postoperative treatment: in group 1 we performed 5 weekly injections of autologous conditioned plasma, whereas group 2 did not undergo further treatments. Animals were killed at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Macroscopic, histologic, and biomechanical evaluations were performed. Differences between groups at each time interval and differences over time within groups were analyzed for each outcome. Significance was set at P < .05.Group 1 showed significantly better macroscopic, histologic, and biomechanical results than group 2 at each time interval. Analysis of time effect within groups showed that in group 1, quality of repair tissue significantly improved from 3 to 6 months after treatment and remained stable over time for all the outcomes; in group 2 a significant histologic and mechanical deterioration was observed between 6 and 12 months' follow-up.Five repeated local injections of autologous conditioned plasma after microfractures in the treatment of full-thickness cartilage injuries promoted a better and more durable reparative response than isolated microfractures, although they did not produce hyaline cartilage.Periodical intra-articular injections of platelet concentrate after microfractures may improve cartilage repair and prevent further degenerative changes.",0

Purpose This study evaluates the use of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for the regeneration of articular cartilage in a rabbit model. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Five conditions were tested to attempt cartilage repair. To compare spontaneous healing (from subchondral plate bleeding) and healing due to tissue engineering, the experiment considered the use of osteochondral defects (to allow blood flow into the defect site) alone or filled with bare PCL scaffold and the use of PCL-chondrocytes constructs in chondral defects. For the latter condition, 1 series of PCL scaffolds was seeded in vitro with rabbit chondrocytes for 7 days and the cell/scaffold constructs were transplanted into rabbits’ articular defects, avoiding compromising the subchondral bone. Cell pellets and bare scaffolds were implanted as controls in a chondral defect. Results After 3 months with PCL scaffolds or cells/PCL constructs, defects were filled with white cartilaginous tissue; integration into the surrounding native cartilage was much better than control (cell pellet). The engineered constructs showed histologically good integration to the subchondral bone and surrounding cartilage with accumulation of extracellular matrix including type II collagen and glycosaminoglycan. The elastic modulus measured in the zone of the defect with the PCL/cells constructs was very similar to that of native cartilage, while that of the pellet-repaired cartilage was much smaller than native cartilage. Conclusion The results are quite promising with respect to the use of PCL scaffolds as aids for the regeneration of articular cartilage using tissue engineering techniques.",0

The purpose of this systematic review was to compare outcomes after combined MAT and cartilage repair/restoration with the outcomes of isolated MAT or cartilage repair/restoration.Multiple databases were searched with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical outcome studies after combined MAT and cartilage repair or restoration.Six studies were identified for inclusion. In total 110 patients underwent combined MAT/cartilage repair or restoration (medial compartment in 66 and lateral compartment in 44). Patients underwent MAT and either autologous chondrocyte implantation (n = 73), osteochondral allograft (n = 20), osteochondral autograft transfer (n = 17), or microfracture (n = 3). Thirty-six patients underwent additional concurrent surgeries (high tibial or distal femoral osteotomy, cruciate or collateral ligament reconstruction, and hardware removal). All clinical outcomes were improved at final follow-up (mean, 36 months). In 4 of 6 studies, overall outcomes of combined surgery were equivalent to those of either procedure performed in isolation. In 2 studies outcomes of combined surgery were not as good as those of either procedure performed in isolation. Failure occurred in 12% of patients who underwent combined MAT and cartilage restoration, and they required revision surgery. Most failures (85%) of combined surgery were due to failure of the MAT (as opposed to the cartilage technique). One-half of all patients required at least 1 surgery after the index procedure before final follow-up.Clinical outcomes after combined MAT and cartilage repair/restoration are similar to those after either procedure in isolation. Despite low rates of complications and failures, there is a high rate of subsequent surgery after combined MAT and cartilage repair or restoration.Level IV, systematic review of Level IV studies.",0

Purpose: To evaluate clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes 2 years after MACT on the knee joint using the Novocart 3D scaffold based on a bilayered collagen type I sponge. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Of 28 initial patients, 23 were clinically and radiologically evaluated 24 months after transplantation. Indications for MACT were chondral or osteochondral lesions on the knee joint with a defect size &gt;2 cm 2 , no instability, and no malalignment (axis deviation &lt;5°). Then, MRI was performed on a 3-T scanner to assess the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) and 3-dimensional (3D) MOCART scores. A variety of subjective scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Noyes sports activity rating scale, Tegner activity scale, and visual analog scale [VAS] for pain) were used for clinical evaluation. Results: Two years after MACT, the MRI evaluation showed a mean MOCART score of 73.2 ± 12.4 and a 3D MOCART score of 73.4 ± 9.7. Clinical results showed mean values of 69.8 ± 15.2 for the IKDC; 51.6 ± 21.2, 86.5 ± 13.9, 54.5 ± 23.6, 65.0 ± 8.0, and 91.5 ± 10.6 for the KOOS subscales (Quality of Life, Pain, Sports and Recreation, Symptoms, and Activities of Daily Living, respectively); 77.5 ± 12.7 for the Noyes scale; 4.4 ± 1.6 for the Tegner activity scale; and 1.8 ± 1.7 for the VAS, with statistically significant improvement in all scores other than KOOS-Symptoms. Conclusion: Undergoing MACT using the Novocart 3D scaffold is an applicable method to treat large focal chondral and osteochondral defects, with good short-term clinical and radiological results.",0

MAT has been shown to significantly reduce pain and improve function in the adult population. The aim of this study was to document the outcomes of a single surgeon case series of MAT in the paediatric population. METHODS: Analysis of a prospective meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) group database of 280 patients was performed. Twenty-three patients met the inclusion criteria-undergoing MAT aged 18 years or younger. RESULTS: Fourteen were female and nine were male with median age of 17 (range 8-18). Thirteen (57%) were right knee and nineteen (83%) were lateral. Additional procedures included high tibial osteotomy, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and microfracture procedures. The median follow-up was 3.8 years (range of 0.2 to 7.8 years). There have been no cases of graft failure. All patients demonstrated improvement in all the modalities of the KOOS outcome scores. At 5 years, the Lysholm score had improved from 57.9 to 87.6 (SD 12.1), Tegner activity score had improved from 2 to 5 (range 4-7) and IKDC score had improved from 40.6 to 78.6 (SD 15.8). Four patients required secondary surgical intervention. No patients developed a superficial or deep infection. CONCLUSION: Meniscal allograft transplantation in children is founded on the successful results of MAT in the adult population. We have demonstrated in this series that MAT can improve function and reduce pain in the paediatric population, and is, therefore, a viable treatment option for the management of the symptomatic paediatric meniscal-deficient knee. Early referral should be considered in the patients with post-meniscectomy syndrome, pain on weight bearing with a history of previous menisectomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2005.05.004,Contrast-enhanced high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of autologous cartilage implants of the knee joint,"Over the past decade, a number of interventions for durable cartilage repair have emerged. Magnetic resonance (MR) tomography is an excellent noninvasive method for monitoring cartilage repair tissues throughout the postsurgical period. However, evaluating cartilage morphology after matrix-based autologous cartilage implantation (ACI) with MR imaging (MRI) still remains a challenge. In this study, we combined a high-resolution cartilage-sensitive fast-spin echo (FSE) sequence with intravenous application of a contrast agent for enhancing synovial fluid. Two independent musculoskeletal radiologists interpreted the pictures for the thickness, length and surface of the cartilage implants. A multivariate two-way analysis of variance with two repeated measures was performed and showed that evaluation of cartilage implant morphology was significantly improved after the application of gadodiamide on proton density FSE images. Contrast-enhanced MRI of articular cartilages is a promising technique in the postoperative follow-up of patients after ACI.",0

The inclusion criteria were animal and clinical studies published in English that used autologous BMAC to treat focal chondral defects of the knee. We excluded studies that evaluated nonconcentrated preparations of bone marrow aspirate or preparations that were culture expanded.A total of 23 studies were included: 10 studies performed in animal models and 13 human clinical studies. Animal studies showed inconsistent outcomes regarding the efficacy of BMAC for the treatment of chondral or osteochondral lesions, assessed by gross morphology, second-look arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, histology, immunohistochemistry, mechanical testing, and micro-tomography. Chondral defect filling was achieved with fibrocartilage or ""hyaline-like"" cartilage. Cells present in BMAC did not meet the criteria to be characterized as mesenchymal stem cells according to the International Society for Cell Therapy because freshly isolated cells failed to show tri-lineage differentiation. Overall, all clinical studies, independent of the study group or level of evidence, reported improved clinical outcomes and higher macroscopic, magnetic resonance imaging, and histology scores. Comparative trials favored BMAC over microfracture and reported equivalent outcomes between BMAC and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. However, clinical studies were scant and showed low scientific rigor, poor methodologic quality, and low levels of evidence on average.Although clinical success in short-term and midterm applications has been suggested for the application of BMAC for the restoration of cartilage defects in lesions of the knee, current study designs are generally of low scientific rigor. In addition, clinical applications of this technology in animal model investigations have shown inconsistent outcomes. Thus, clinicians should apply this technology cautiously.Level IV, systematic review of Level II, III, and IV evidence studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546515609597,Bone Marrow Concentrate Improves Early Cartilage Phase Maturation of a Scaffold Plug in the Knee,"Background: Limited information exists on the clinical use of a synthetic osteochondral scaffold plug for cartilage restoration in the knee. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to compare the early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, including quantitative T2 values, between cartilage defects treated with a scaffold versus a scaffold with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). The hypothesis was that the addition of PRP or BMAC would result in an improved cartilage appearance. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Forty-six patients with full-thickness cartilage defects of the femur were surgically treated with a control scaffold (n = 11), scaffold with PRP (n = 23), or scaffold with BMAC (n = 12) and were followed prospectively. Patients underwent MRI with a qualitative assessment and quantitative T2 mapping at 12 months after surgery. An image assessment was performed retrospectively by a blinded musculoskeletal radiologist. The cartilage phase was measured by cartilage fill and quantitative T2 values on MRI. A comparison between groups after cartilage repair was performed. Results: The control scaffold group consisted of 8 male and 3 female patients (mean age, 38 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 25 kg/m 2 ), the PRP group had 15 male and 8 female patients (mean age, 39 years; mean BMI, 26 kg/m 2 ), and the BMAC group consisted of 8 male and 4 female patients (mean age, 36 years; mean BMI, 26 kg/m 2 ). The PRP-treated ( P = .002) and BMAC-treated ( P = .03) scaffolds had superior cartilage fill compared with the control group. With quantitative methods, the PRP group demonstrated a mean T2 value (49.1 ms) that was similar to that of the control scaffold group (42.7 ms; P = .07), but the BMAC group demonstrated a mean T2 value (60.5 ms) closer to that of superficial hyaline cartilage ( P = .01). The stratification of T2 values between the deep and superficial zones was not observed in any of the groups. Conclusion: In this comparative study, patients treated with scaffold implantation augmented with BMAC had improved cartilage maturation with greater fill and mean T2 values closer to that of superficial native hyaline cartilage at 12 months. Further work will determine if this translates into improved clinical outcomes.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-015-3575-y,Clinical and MRI outcomes of HA injection following arthroscopic microfracture for osteochondral lesions of the talus,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes of arthroscopic microfracture surgery alone or in combination with hyaluronic acid (HA) injection in the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus who underwent arthroscopic microfracture were included and followed up for at least 9 months post-operatively. The patients were randomly divided into non-injection group (n = 17) who received treatment with microfracture surgery alone and injection group (n = 18) who also accepted intra-articular injection of HA post-operatively. Quantitative MRI was used to evaluate the cartilage repair after surgery. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hind foot Scale scores and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. RESULTS: After operation, the MRI outcomes showed that the thickness index was higher (0.8 ± 0.1 vs. 0.7 ± 0.1) and the T2 index was lower (1.2 ± 0.1 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1) in the injection group than in the non-injection group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.01). As for the volumes of subchondral bone marrow oedema, there are no significant differences between groups (n.s.). Compared with the non-injection group, the AOFAS score and the VAS score yielded a higher level of improvement in injection group at final follow-up post-operatively (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic microfracture is a safe and effective procedure for osteochondral lesions of the talus. Intra-articular HA injection as an adjunct to arthroscopic microfracture might offer better functional recovery than microfracture alone. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2009.04.077,Arthroscopic Implantation of a Matrix to Cover Large Chondral Defect During Microfracture,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Microfracturing techniques have been reported to be successful cartilage-restoring treatment options in defects of smaller sizes. The success may be limited by the size of the defect and the shoulder of the intact surrounding cartilage. We report a new technique using a 3-dimensional matrix to cover large cartilage defects during microfracture healing. In contrast to autologous chondrocyte implantation techniques, this technique is a 1-stage procedure. The defect cover consists of a resorbable polymer felt and sodium hyaluronan to induce hemostasis and to protect the underlying tissue. After conventional microfracture, the defect size is determined with an intra-articular measuring device, and the matrix is sized and introduced with an arthroscopic grasp. Depending on the size of the defect, the 3-dimensional matrix is fixed with 1 or 2 biodegradable pins perpendicular to the surface. The combination of the common microfracture technique with the implantation of the matrix leads to complete defect filling with cartilaginous repair tissue and therefore improves cartilage regeneration in the defect. We conclude that the introduced technique may be helpful in large cartilage defects combining the benefit of microfracturing and avoidance of the increased morbidity of matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09611-5,Management of the Failed OCD,"Purpose of the ReviewOsteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a pathologic condition of subchondral bone most frequently occurring in the medial femoral condyle of the knee in children and adolescents. Salvage techniques are necessary when either nonoperative or typical operative treatments fail, or the OCD presents in an unsalvageable state. The purpose of this review is to describe the evaluation and management of failed OCDs.Recent FindingsThorough preoperative planning is essential to the treatment of failed OCDs. Radiographs and advanced imaging such as MRI and CT allow for a detailed assessment of subchondral bone and cartilage. Long-leg alignment radiographs are critical to assess for malalignment which may increase the contact forces on the affected condyle. Malalignment can be corrected with hemiepiphysiodesis or an osteotomy depending on the skeletal maturity of the patient. Osteochondral allografts and autologous chondrocyte implantation treat the defect in both bone and cartilage or solely cartilage and have good short to moderate term outcomes, particularly as compared to the inferior outcomes of microfracture of larger OCDs.SummaryOsteochondritis dissecans of the knee that fails to heal with initial operative measures can result in a large defect of bone and cartilage in the knee of adolescents. Treatment of the bone and cartilage defect can be accomplished with either osteochondral allograft transplantation or matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation can be performed with good outcomes. Assessment and correction of lower extremity malalignment is a critical component of treatment. Durable long-term solutions are necessary for the treatment of these difficult lesions.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.h.00668,Articular Cartilage Degeneration Following the Treatment of Focal Cartilage Defects with Ceramic Metal Implants and Compared with Microfracture,"Localized cartilage defects are frequently associated with joint pain, reduced function, and a predisposition to the development of osteoarthritis. The purposes of the current study were to investigate the feasibility of the application of defect-sized femoral implants for the treatment of localized cartilage defects and to compare this treatment, in terms of joint degeneration, with the use of microfracture in a goat model of established cartilage defects.In nine Dutch milk goats, a defect in the medial femoral condyle was created in both knees. After ten weeks, the knees were randomly treated by microfracture or by placement of an oxidized zirconium implant. At twenty-six weeks after surgery, the animals were killed. The joints were evaluated macroscopically. Implant osseointegration was measured by automated histomorphometry, and cartilage repair (after microfracture) was scored histologically. Cartilage quality was analyzed macroscopically and histologically. Glycosaminoglycan content and release were measured by alcian blue assay, and the synthesis and release of newly formed glycosaminoglycans were measured by liquid scintillation analysis of the incorporation of 35SO4(2-) in tissue and medium.The mean bone-implant contact (and standard error) was appropriate (14.6%+/-5.4%), and the amount of bone surrounding the implant was extensive (mean, 40.3%+/-4.0%). The healing of the microfracture-treated defects was extensive, although not complete (mean, 18.38+/-0.43 points of a maximum possible score of 24 points). The macroscopic cartilage evaluation did not show any significant differences between the treatments. On histologic evaluation, the cartilage of the medial tibial plateau articulating directly against the treated defects demonstrated significantly more degeneration in the microfracture-treated knees than in the implant-treated knees (p<0.05). This was in accordance with a significantly higher glycosaminoglycan content, higher synthetic activity, and decreased glycosaminoglycan release of the medial tibial plateau cartilage of the implant-treated knees (p<0.05 for all). On histological analysis, degeneration was also found in the cartilage of the lateral tibial plateau and condyle, but no significant difference was found between the treatments.Both microfracture and the use of implants as a treatment for established localized cartilage defects in the medial femoral condyle caused considerable (p < 0.05) degeneration of the directly articulating cartilage as well as in more remote sites in the knee. However, in the medial tibial plateau, the metal implants caused less damage than the microfracture technique.",1

Alginate served as a temporary supportive matrix component and was removed prior to transplantation. The defects were analyzed macroscopically, histologically, and electron microscopically, and evaluated with a semi-quantitative score system. Periosteal cell transplants showed a chondrogenic differentiation, which results in the development of embryonic-like cartilage tissue after 4 weeks and complete resurfacing of the patellar groove after 12 weeks. In the control groups, no repair was observed. Under the influence of TGF-beta1 we observed a reduction of the cartilage layer, whereas the osteochondral integration and the zonal architecture were improved. Periosteal cell-beads are stable cartilage transplants and have stiffness and elasticity enough for easy and sufficient transplant fixation. Further investigations are necessary to optimize the application of TGF-beta1 for cartilage repair.",0

The main technical problem is one of access for arthroscopy instruments to posteromedial lesions. A range of techniques and approaches has been described in ankle arthroscopy in general, and a transmalleolar approach provides reliable and efficient access in these cases.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2013.05.027,Evidence-Based Status of Microfracture Technique: A Systematic Review of Level I and II Studies,"Although many newer cartilage repair techniques have evolved over the past 2 decades, microfracture is still being advocated as the first line of treatment. Therefore it is timely to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature to assess and report on the current status of Level I and II evidence studies related to microfracture techniques.A literature search was carried out for Level I and II evidence studies on cartilage repair using the PubMed database. All the studies that dealt with microfracture techniques were selected.Fifteen studies that involved microfracture techniques met the inclusion criteria of this review article, with 6 long-term and 9 short-term studies. These studies compared the clinical outcomes of microfracture with those of other treatments such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral cylinder transfers. The majority of the studies reported poor clinical outcomes, whereas 2 studies reported the absence of any significant difference in the results. Small-sized lesions and younger patients showed good results in the short-term. However, osteoarthritis and treatment failures were observed at later postoperative periods of 5 to 10 years.The use of microfracture for the treatment of small lesions in patients with low postoperative demands was observed to result in good clinical outcomes at short-term follow-up. Beyond 5 years postoperatively, treatment failure after microfracture could be expected regardless of lesion size. Younger patients showed better clinical outcomes.Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546519855645,Dynamic Compressive Loading Improves Cartilage Repair in an In Vitro Model of Microfracture: Comparison of 2 Mechanical Loading Regimens on Simulated Microfracture Based on Fibrin Gel Scaffolds Encapsulating Connective Tissue Progenitor Cells,"Background: Microfracture of focal chondral defects often produces fibrocartilage, which inconsistently integrates with the surrounding native tissue and possesses inferior mechanical properties compared with hyaline cartilage. Mechanical loading modulates cartilage during development, but it remains unclear how loads produced in the course of postoperative rehabilitation affect the formation of the new fibrocartilaginous tissue. Purpose: To assess the influence of different mechanical loading regimens, including dynamic compressive stress or rotational shear stress, on an in vitro model of microfracture repair based on fibrin gel scaffolds encapsulating connective tissue progenitor cells. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Cylindrical cores were made in bovine hyaline cartilage explants and filled with either (1) cartilage plug returned to original location (positive control), (2) fibrin gel (negative control), or (3) fibrin gel with encapsulated connective tissue progenitor cells (microfracture mimic). Constructs were then subjected to 1 of 3 loading regimens: (1) no loading (ie, unloaded), (2) dynamic compressive loading, or (3) rotational shear loading. On days 0, 7, 14, and 21, the integration strength between the outer chondral ring and the central insert was measured with an electroforce mechanical tester. The central core component, mimicking microfracture neotissue, was also analyzed for gene expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, glycosaminoglycan, and double-stranded DNA contents, and tissue morphology was analyzed histologically. Results: Integration strengths between the outer chondral ring and central neotissue of the cartilage plug and fibrin + cells groups significantly increased upon exposure to compressive loading compared with day 0 controls ( P = .007). Compressive loading upregulated expression of chondrogenesis-associated genes (SRY-related HGMG box-containing gene 9 [ SOX9], collagen type II α1 [ COL2A1], and increased ratio of COL2A1 to collagen type I α1 [ COL1A1], an indicator of more hyaline phenotype) in the neotissue of the fibrin + cells group compared with the unloaded group at day 21 ( SOX9, P = .0032; COL2A1, P &lt; .0001; COL2A1:COL1A1, P = .0308). Fibrin + cells constructs exposed to shear loading expressed higher levels of chondrogenic genes compared with the unloaded condition, but the levels were not as high as those for the compressive loading condition. Furthermore, catabolic markers ( MMP3 and ADAMTS 5) were significantly upregulated by shear loading ( P = .0234 and P &lt; .0001, respectively) at day 21 compared with day 0. Conclusion: Dynamic compressive loading enhanced neotissue chondrogenesis and maturation in a simulated in vitro model of microfracture, with generation of more hyaline-like cartilage and improved integration with the surrounding tissue. Clinical Relevance: Controlled loading after microfracture may be beneficial in promoting the formation of more hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue; however, the loading regimens applied in this in vitro model do not yet fully reproduce the complex loading patterns created during clinical rehabilitation. Further optimization of in vitro models of cartilage repair may ultimately inform rehabilitation protocols.",0

Our secondary purpose was to evaluate radiographic outcomes after treatment.PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase.Studies published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2018 that included patient-reported functional outcomes for patients after operative treatment of patellar chondral defects at a minimum 2-year follow-up were included.Systematic review.Level 4.MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies) score, level of evidence, sample size, demographic data, follow-up data, intervention, functional outcome scores, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected.The review identified 10 studies and 293 patients receiving cartilage restoration procedures for patellar chondral defects with extractable clinical and radiographic results and data on complications and reoperations. All treatments (autologous chondrocyte implantation [ACI], matrix-induced ACI [MACI], autologous osteochondral transplantation [AOT]) utilized in the management of patellar chondral lesions, with the exception of isolated particulated juvenile articular cartilage, demonstrated statistically significant improvements in functional outcome scores compared with preoperative measurements at a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Postoperative MRIs were obtained in 6 studies and found that regardless of treatment, moderate-to-complete infill of patellar cartilage lesions was seen in the majority of patients. While failure rates were low for the various treatment modalities, rates of reoperation were substantial, with up to 40% to 60% reoperation rate seen after ACI.Patients treated with ACI, MACI, and AOT all demonstrated statistically significant improvements in functional outcome scores with radiographic evidence of healing at minimum of 2-year follow-up.

Bone marrow was harvested from the posterior iliac crest in 11 New Zealand White rabbits. MSC were isolated and cultured in autologous serum for 28 days and transferred to a hyaluronan scaffold 24 h prior to implantation. A 4 mm diameter and 1.5 mm deep defect was created in the medial femoral condyle of both knees and the scaffold with MSC was implanted in one knee while an empty scaffold was implanted in the contra-lateral knee. After 24 weeks the rabbits were killed and histological sections were subjected to semiquantitative and quantitative evaluation by observers blinded regarding treatment modality. High degree of filling was obtained, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. However, there was a tendency for a better quality of repair in the MSC treated knees. No hypertrophy was observed by either method. MSC in a hyaluronan scaffold may be a promising treatment approach, but further studies are needed to determine the best combination of scaffold and cells.",0

The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical results of this technique at an average follow up of 162±27months (range 88-208) in a group of patients who underwent ACI.32 patients were operated between 1997 and 2007 for chondral lesions or osteochondritis dissecans of the knee. Mean size of the defect was 5.48cm2±1.53 (range 2-9). Nine patients were treated with I generation technique and 23 with II generation. All patients were evaluated with Subjective IKDC and Tegner Activity Scales for clinical outcomes and with EQ-VAS for a quantitative measure of health after intervention, starting from pre-operative period and at regular follow up (minimum 88 months-maximum 208 months).A significant increment of all scores was noticed comparing preoperative and postoperative results. In particular medium IKDC score increased from 40.3±9.6 in preoperative evaluation to 74.2±11.6 at one year (p<0.00001) and to 83.9±10.4 at 5 years follow up (p<0.001). Mean IKDC values at the last follow-up were 80.3±14.2, showing no statistical differences with those obtained at five-year follow-up. Tegner Activity Scale values increased from 2.8±1.1 preoperatively to 4.1±1.1 (p<0.0001) after one year and to 6±1.1 at five years (p<0.0001). Mean Tegner Activity Scale values decreased to 4.8±1.4 at the last follow-up. EQ-VAS evaluation showed superposable results comparing the 5 years evaluation with the ones at a medium follow up of 162±27months.The most important finding is the reliability at long-term of ACI technique, which in our series gave excellent clinical results. No statistical differences were observed between first- and second-generation. Clinical outcomes were significantly better for defects in the femoral condyles, influenced by age (worse results over 30 years old).ACI represents a valid technique for chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee in a population heterogeneous for age, sex and activity level with good results even at a long term follow up.",0
,Mechanical strength of trabecular bone at the knee.,"Interest in the biomechanical properties of trabecular bone has expanded in response to the problems related to total and partial joint replacement with the knee joint constituting a main focus of attention. This relatively recent development has left a number of fundamental problems unanswered, especially related to the machining, storage and testing of trabecular bone specimens. Nevertheless, these studies have contributed to the understanding of the mechanical function of trabecular bone. Regarding the role of trabecular bone at the knee joint, the following conclusions may be emphasized (conclusions drawn from the author's previous studies (I-X) are shown in italics): (1) Trabecular bone is almost exclusively responsible for the transmission of load at the proximal tibial epiphysis from the knee joint to the metaphysis. The peripheral shell surrounding the epiphysis is not composed of cortical bone and plays a negligible role in load transmission. (2) The compressive strength and stiffness of trabecular bone is primarily dependent upon the apparent density, trabecular architecture and the strength of the bone material. Direct and indirect sources suggest that the true material strength of trabecular bone is less than that of cortical bone. The epiphyseal trabecular architecture, featuring a marked polarity with alignment of primary trabeculae at right angles to the joint surface, is responsible for functional anisotropy which points to the axial compressive properties as the more important mechanical parameters. (3) Tensile and shear properties are of special relevance to mechanical loosening of implants. These properties may be derived from the apparent density, and a close empirical relation to the axial compressive strength and stiffness is suggested. (4) The foam-like structure of trabecular bone is the basis for the large energy absorptive capacity. (5) The pattern of axial compressive stiffness and strength at the normal proximal tibia differs little among individuals. Supporting the medial tibial plateau is a large high strength area with maximal strength centrally and slightly anteriorly, while laterally there is a restricted area of relatively high strength posteriorly with a lower maximal value than medially. Bone strength is significantly reduced within ten millimeters of the subchondral bone plate, and this reduction continues distally at the lateral condyle. At both condyles strength is reduced towards the periphery with very low values being obtained at the margins of the condyles and at the intercondylar region. Absolute bone strength values are influenced by the level of physical activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0

Here, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cultured autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) attached to the 3D Chondrotissue (R) scaffold by autologous blood plasma coagulation (BiCure (R) ortho MSCp) in the treatment of knee cartilage defects. Methods The primary endpoint of this phase I/IIa clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of the treatment. The secondary objective was to determine the short-to-medium-term therapeutic outcomes by standardized scoring questionnaires including Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (Lysholm score), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) systems and imaging (X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). A total of six patients were included and followed for 12 months after the surgery. Results BiCure (R) ortho MSCp was well tolerated with no adverse events associated with the investigational medicinal product. Significant improvements were observed in Lysholm scores and KOOS while X-ray showed no deterioration of the arthritis and MRI revealed a persistent filling of the chondral defects by the implant. Conclusion Overall, our data demonstrate the safety of the tested investigational medicinal product. The function of the treated knee improved within one year after surgery in all enrolled patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2015.08.045,Porous titanium bases for osteochondral tissue engineering,"Tissue engineering of osteochondral grafts may offer a cell-based alternative to native allografts, which are in short supply. Previous studies promote the fabrication of grafts consisting of a viable cell-seeded hydrogel integrated atop a porous, bone-like metal. Advantages of the manufacturing process have led to the evaluation of porous titanium as the bone-like base material. Here, porous titanium was shown to support the growth of cartilage to produce native levels of Young's modulus, using a clinically relevant cell source. Mechanical and biochemical properties were similar or higher for the osteochondral constructs compared to chondral-only controls. Further investigation into the mechanical influence of the base on the composite material suggests that underlying pores may decrease interstitial fluid pressurization and applied strains, which may be overcome by alterations to the base structure. Future studies aim to optimize titanium-based tissue engineered osteochondral constructs to best match the structural architecture and strength of native grafts.The studies described in this manuscript follow up on previous studies from our lab pertaining to the fabrication of osteochondral grafts that consist of a bone-like porous metal and a chondrocyte-seeded hydrogel. Here, tissue engineered osteochondral grafts were cultured to native stiffness using adult chondrocytes, a clinically relevant cell source, and a porous titanium base, a material currently used in clinical implants. This porous titanium is manufactured via selective laser melting, offering the advantages of precise control over shape, pore size, and orientation. Additionally, this manuscript describes the mechanical influence of the porous base, which may have applicability to porous bases derived from other materials.",0

The arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular pathologies, such as femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and labral tears, when associated with those alterations, has been suggested to provide inferior outcomes to those in patients without subchondral changes. Yet, the direct treatment of subchondral pathology has been limited. Recently, a technique for insufflating bone substitute into the bone marrow lesions of the knee, Subchondroplasty (Zimmer Knee Creations, Exton, PA), has led to promising results. Subchondroplasty has raised attention as a possible minimally invasive procedure to treat cystic changes in the acetabulum in patients who are not yet candidates for hip replacement. We present the technique of acetabular Subchondroplasty, in which a bone substitute material is injected into subchondral acetabular cysts under fluoroscopic guidance. In this technique, hip arthroscopy is used in conjunction with fluoroscopic guidance to address intra-articular pathologies and assess for possible intra-articular extravasation of the injectable material.",0
,In vivo cultivation of human articular chondrocytes in a nude mouse-based contained defect organ culture model.,"The nude mouse model is an established method to cultivate and investigate tissue engineered cartilage analogues under in vivo conditions. One limitation of this common approach is the lack of appropriate surrounding articular tissues. Thus the bonding capacity of cartilage repair tissue cannot be evaluated. Widely applied surgical techniques in cartilage repair such as conventional and three-dimensional autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) based on a collagen gel matrix cannot be included into nude mouse studies, since their application require a contained defect. The aim of this study is to apply an organ culture defect model for the in vivo cultivation of different cell-matrix-constructs. Cartilage defects were created on osteochondral specimens which had been harvested from 10 human knee joints during total knee replacement. Autologous chondrocytes were isolated from the cartilage samples and cultivated in monolayer until passage 2. On each osteochondral block defects were treated either by conventional ACI or a collagen gel seeded with autologous chondrocytes, including a defect left empty as a control. The samples were implanted into the subcutaneous pouches of nude mice and cultivated for six weeks. After retrieval, the specimens were examined histologically, immunohistochemically and by cell morphology quantification. In both, ACI and collagen gel based defect treatment, a repair tissue was formed, which filled the defect and bonded to the adjacent tissues. The repair tissue was immature with low production of collagen type II. In both groups redifferentiation of chondrocytes remained incomplete. Different appearances of interface zones between the repair tissue and the adjacent cartilage were found. The presented contained defect organ culture model offers the possibility to directly compare different types of clinically applied biologic cartilage repair techniques using human articular tissues in a nude mouse model.",0

Critical size osteochondral defects were created in knee joints of Newzealand White rabbits. Allogenic rabbit chondrocytes were encapsulated in hydrogels and gel or gel+cells were implanted in defects aseptically. The regenerated cartilage was analyzed after 12 weeks of implantation. The morphological scoring indicates that repair tissue was formed in all the animals by 12 weeks irrespective of whether they were sham, received gel, or gel with cells as implant. However the repair tissue formed in sham appeared fibrous and opaque, where as those that received gel had texture similar to the surrounding native cartilage and animals with gel+cells showed varied response. Histology staining, score distribution and immunostaining for collagen Type II showed animals that received gel alone as the implant had a mixture of hyaline and fibro cartilage. The animals with cell encapsulated gels had more fibrous cells with weak staining for collagen type II. There was no significant enhancement in the quality of regenerated cartilage in presence of encapsulated chondrocytes.",0

For the definition of pertinent variables the repair tissue of 45 patients treated with three different techniques for cartilage repair (microfracture, autologous osteochondral transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation) was analyzed 6 and 12 months after the procedure. High-resolution imaging was obtained with a surface phased array coil placed over the knee compartment of interest and adapted sequences were used on a 1T MRI scanner. The analysis of the repair tissue included the definition and rating of nine pertinent variables: the degree of filling of the defect, the integration to the border zone, the description of the surface and structure, the signal intensity, the status of the subchondral lamina and subchondral bone, the appearance of adhesions and the presence of synovitis. High-resolution MRI, using a surface phased array coil and specific sequences, can be used on every standard 1 or 1.5T MRI scanner according to the in-house standard protocols for knee imaging in patients who have had cartilage repair procedures without substantially prolonging the total imaging time. The new classification and grading system allows a subtle description and suitable assessment of the articular cartilage repair tissue.",0

Osteotomy of the medial malleolus is not unusual but presents the risk of malunion or irritation by hardware. The aim of the study was to analyze data from the German Cartilage Society (Knorpelregister DGOU) to evaluate the influence of medial malleolar osteotomy on clinical results of M-BMS + I/III collagen scaffold.The ankle module of the Cartilage Register includes a total of 718 patients, while 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were treated with an M-BMS + I/III collagen scaffold of the medial talus, 30 without and 15 with an osteotomy of the medial malleolus. The follow-up evaluations included FAAM (Foot and Ankle Ability Measure), FAOS (Foot and Ankle Outcome Score), and VAS (visual analogue scale).Forty-five patients (22 male, 23 female) aged between 18 and 69 years (mean: 34 years) were included in this study. Between preoperative and 12 months postoperative, we noted a significant improvement in FAAM-ADL (Activity of Daily Living) (P = 0.004) as well as FAOS-Pain (P = 0.001), FAOS-Stiffness (P = 0.047), FAOS-ADL (P = 0.002), FAOS-Sport (P = 0.001), and FAOS Quality of Life (P = 0.009). There was no significant difference between patients who underwent an osteotomy or not.The results show a significant improvement in patients' outcome scores following a M-BMS + I/III collagen scaffold. No statistical difference was noted among those undergoing medial malleolar osteotomy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202101127,Biomimetic Scaffolds Modulate the Posttraumatic Inflammatory Response in Articular Cartilage Contributing to Enhanced Neoformation of Cartilaginous Tissue In Vivo,"Focal chondral lesions of the knee are the most frequent type of trauma in younger patients and are associated with a high risk of developing early posttraumatic osteoarthritis. The only current clinical solutions include microfracture, osteochondral grafting, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. Cartilage tissue engineering based on biomimetic scaffolds has become an appealing strategy to repair cartilage defects. Here, a chondrogenic collagen-chondroitin sulfate scaffold is tested in an orthotopic Lapine in vivo model to understand the beneficial effects of the immunomodulatory biomaterial on the full chondral defect. Using a combination of noninvasive imaging techniques, histological and whole transcriptome analysis, the scaffolds are shown to enhance the formation of cartilaginous tissue and suppression of host cartilage degeneration, while also supporting tissue integration and increased tissue regeneration over a 12 weeks recovery period. The results presented suggest that biomimetic materials could be a clinical solution for cartilage tissue repair, due to their ability to modulate the immune environment in favor of regenerative processes and suppression of cartilage degeneration.",0

Patients undergoing OAT have been shown to have the greatest rate and quickest return to sport of any cartilage-restoration procedure. Disadvantages encountered with the OAT procedure include limited donor sources, small treatable lesion size, and donor-site morbidity. Here, we describe our preferred technique of open OAT with donor-site back-filling using precut fresh osteochondral allograft plugs and micronized extracellular cartilage augmentation. Advantages to this technique include single-stage transfer of living autologous osteochondral grafts allowing for early ambulation, predictable return to sport, enhanced long-term graft survival, and decreased donor-site morbidity secondary to fresh osteochondral allograft back-fill.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.08.009,Tailoring the subchondral bone phase of a multi-layered osteochondral construct to support bone healing and a cartilage analog,"Focal chondral and osteochondral defects create significant pain and disability for working-aged adults. Current osteochondral repair grafts are limited in availability and often fail due to insufficient osseous support and integration. Thus, a need exists for an off-the-shelf osteochondral construct with the propensity to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, a scalable process was used to develop a multi-layered osteochondral graft with a subchondral bone (ScB) phase tailored to support bone healing and integration. Multiple ScB formulations and fabrication techniques were screened via degradation, bioactivity, and unconfined compression testing. An optimized ScB construct was selected and its cytotoxicity assessed. Additionally, a cartilage analog was secured to the optimized ScB construct via a calcified cartilage layer, and the resulting osteochondral construct was characterized via interfacial shear and dynamic mechanical testing. The optimized ScB construct did not significantly alter local pH during degradation, exhibited measurable bioactivity in vitro, and had significantly greater compressive mechanical strength compared to other constructs. The attachment strength of the cartilage analog was significantly greater by an increase in compressive dynamic mechanical properties. Furthermore, this ScB construct was found to be cytocompatible with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Taken together, this optimized ScB material forms the robust foundation of a novel, off-the-shelf osteochondral construct to be used in defect repair.The quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide is detrimentally affected by focal chondral or osteochondral defects. Current off-the-shelf biomaterial constructs often fail to repair these defects due to insufficient osseous support and integration. Herein, we used a scalable process to fabricate and optimize a novel boney construct. This optimized boney construct demonstrated biochemical, physical, and mechanical properties tailored to promote bone healing. Furthermore, a novel cartilage analog was successfully attached to the boney construct, forming a multi-layered osteochondral construct.",0

Most of the studies were performed with intra-articular injections. However, subchondral bone plays an important role in the progression of osteoarthritis. We investigated by a literature review whether joint, subchondral bone, or/and scaffolds implantation of fresh autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrated (BMAC) containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would improve osteoarthritis (OA). There is in vivo evidence that suggests that all these different approaches (intra-articular injections, subchondral implantation, scaffolds loaded with BMAC) can improve the patient. This review analyzes the evidence for each different approach to treat OA. We found that the use of intra-articular injections resulted in a significant relief of pain symptoms in the short term and was maintained in 12 months. However, the clinical trials indicate that the application of autologous bone marrow concentrates in combination with scaffolds or in injection in the subchondral bone was superior to intra-articular injection for long-term results. The tendency of MSCs to differentiate into fibrocartilage affecting the outcome was a common issue faced by all the studies when biopsies were performed, except for scaffolds implantation in which some hyaline cartilage was found. The review suggests also that both implantation of subchondral BMAC and scaffolds loaded with BMAC could reduce the need for further surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-022-07023-1,Chitosan based scaffold applied in patellar cartilage lesions showed positive clinical and MRI results at minimum 2 years of follow up,"Purpose New scaffold-based cartilage regeneration techniques have been developed to improve the results of microfractures also in complex locations like the patello-femoral joint. The aim of this study was to analyse the results obtained in patellar lesions treated with a bioscaffold, a mixture composed by a chitosan solution, a buffer, and the patient's whole blood which forms a stable clot into the lesion. Methods Fifteen patients with ICRS grade 3-4 cartilage lesions of the patellar surface were treated with a chitosan bioscaffold. Fourteen patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated prospectively for a minimum follow-up of 2 years with IKDC, KOOS, Tegner score, and MRI. The mean age of patients at the time of surgery was 31.8 +/- 11.9 and nine patients presented degenerative aetiology, four patients with previous trauma, and 1 patient with osteochondritis dissecans. Results The IKDC subjective score improved from 46.2 +/- 19.3 preoperatively to 69.5 +/- 20.3 (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) and 74.1 +/- 23.2 (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Also KOOS Pain, KOOS Sport/Rec and KOOS QOL showed a significant improvement from baseline to 12 months and to the final follow-up. MRI evaluation showed a complete filling of the cartilage defect at the final follow-up in 70% of the lesions, obtaining a total MOCART 2.0 score of 71.5 +/- 13.6 at 24 months after surgery. Conclusion Chondral patellar lesions represent a complex pathology, with lower results compared to other sites. This bioscaffold represents a safe surgical treatment providing a significant clinical improvement at 24 months in the treatment of patellar cartilage lesions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546518803757,A Novel Arthroscopic Technique for Intraoperative Mobilization of Synovial Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising candidate for tissue regeneration and restoration of intra-articular structures such as cartilage, ligaments, and menisci. However, the routine use of MSCs is limited in part by their low numbers and the need for methods and procedures outside of the joint or surgical field. Purpose: To demonstrate feasibility of a technique in which minimally manipulated synovial MSCs can be mobilized during knee arthroscopy, thereby showing proof of concept for the future evaluation and clinical use of native joint resident MSCs in single-stage joint repair strategies. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Patients (n = 15) undergoing knee arthroscopy who were free from synovitis or active inflammation were selected. Three samples of irrigation fluid were collected from each patient at inception of the procedure, after an initial inspection of the joint, and after agitation of the synovium. MSC numbers were evaluated by colony forming unit–fibroblastic assay. The phenotype of synovial fluid resident and synovial-mobilized MSCs was determined by flow cytometry, and their functionality was determined by trilineage differentiation. Adhesion of culture-expanded mobilized MSCs to fibrin scaffolds was also evaluated to ascertain whether mobilized MSCs might concentrate at sites of bleeding. Results: Normal irrigation during arthroscopy depleted resident synovial fluid MSCs (4-fold decrease, n = 15). Numbers of MSCs mobilized through use of a purpose-made device were significantly higher (105-fold) than those mobilized through use of a cytology brush (median of 5763 and 54 colonies, respectively; P = .001; n = 15). The mobilized cellular fraction contained viable MSCs with proliferative potential and trilineage differentiation capacity for bone, cartilage, and fat lineages, and cultured daughter cells exhibited the standard MSC phenotype. Following culture, mobilized synovial MSCs also adhered to various fibrin scaffolds in vitro. The technique was simple and convenient to use and was not associated with any complications. Conclusion: Numbers of functional MSCs can be greatly increased during arthroscopy through use of this technique to mobilize cells from the synovium. Clinical Relevance: This study highlights a novel, single-stage technique to increase joint-specific, synovial-derived MSCs and thereby increase the repair potential of the joint. This technique can be undertaken during many arthroscopic procedures, and it supports the principle of integrating mobilized MSCs into microfracture sites and sites of bleeding or targeted repair through use of fibrin-based and other scaffolds.",0

Filling an articular cartilage defect with at least a ""mixed hyaline cartilage"" repair is no longer a question. The task at hand is somehow refining and defining the when, where, what, and how of the cartilage-growing procedures. The new ideas emerging are reflected in the recent literature, and all ideas regarding the specifics of these cartilage techniques and their outcomes should be welcomed. The information gained, that is, quality and quantity by magnetic resonance imaging and/or morphology (macro and micro), will allow the surgeon a choice as these techniques should certainly be part of a cartilage surgeon's armamentarium. No longer should microfracture and debridement be the only alternatives. Not only should we ""save the meniscus"" but we should also ""save the articular cartilage.""",0

Arthroscopic debridement is still a valuable treatment when detailed indications are considered. Microfracture procedure showed good and excellent results primarily at a follow-up of 2 years. Cartilage defects up to 4 cm2 should be treated by the mosaic-type osteochondral autologous transplantation. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) should be discussed when larger defects are presented in the younger patient. Existing osteoarthritis, ACI is not recommended. Up till now, there was no significant difference in outcomes comparing ACI and mosaicplasty or microfracture. Basic for successful surgical cartilage repair is a stable joint with a normal limb. An eventual additional osteotomy of the knee should be considered based on a standing, three-joint radiograph in every patient.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.16.00603,Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI) Using a Cell-Seeded Collagen Membrane Improves Cartilage Healing in the Equine Model,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) using a collagen scaffold (matrix-induced ACI; MACI) is a next-generation approach to traditional ACI that provides the benefit of autologous cells and guided tissue regeneration using a biocompatible collagen scaffold. The MACI implant also has inherent advantages including surgical implantation via arthroscopy or miniarthrotomy, the elimination of periosteal harvest, and the use of tissue adhesive in lieu of sutures. This study evaluated the efficacy of the MACI implant in an equine full-thickness cartilage defect model at 1 year.Autologous chondrocytes were seeded onto a collagen type-I/III membrane and implanted into one of two 15-mm defects in the femoral trochlear ridge of 24 horses. Control defects either were implanted with cell-free collagen type-I/III membrane (12 horses) or were left ungrafted as empty defects (12 horses). An additional 3 horses had both 15-mm defects remain empty as nonimplanted joints. The repair was scored by second-look arthroscopy (12 weeks), and necropsy examination (53 weeks). Healing was assessed by arthroscopic scoring, gross assessment, histology and immunohistology, cartilage matrix component assay, and gene expression determination. Toxicity was examined by prostaglandin E2 formation in joint fluid, and lymph node morphology combined with histologic screening of organs.MACI-implanted defects had improved gross healing and composite histologic scores, as well as increases in chondrocyte predominance, toluidine blue-stained matrix, and collagen type-II content compared with scaffold-only implanted or empty defects. There was minimal evidence of reaction to the implant in the synovial membrane (minor perivascular cuffing), subchondral bone, or cartilage. There were no adverse clinical effects, signs of organ toxicity, or evidence of chondrocytes or collagen type-I/III membrane in draining lymph nodes.The MACI implant appeared to improve cartilage healing in a critical-sized defect in the equine model compared with collagen matrix alone.These results indicate that the MACI implant is quick to insert, provides chondrocyte security in the defect, and improves cartilage healing compared with ACI.",0

Numerous scaffold materials exist and the optimal scaffold needs to be identified. We have tried to assess the possibilities for cartilage repair by the use of two different scaffold techniques; autologous chondrocytes in a fibrin hydrogel and a novel MPEG-PLGA scaffold, where autologous chondrocytes are immobilized within the MPEG-PLGA scaffold by a fibrin hydrogel. Twenty adult goats were used for the study. A 6 mm circular full-thickness cartilage defect was created in both medial femoral condyles. The defects were randomized to the following four treatment groups. (1) Empty defect (control). (2) Subchondral drilling (control). (3) Fibrin hydrogel with autologous chondrocytes. (4) Fibrin hydrogel/chondrocyte solution in a MPEG-PLGA porous scaffold. Animals were followed for 4 month. Eight defects in each treatment group completed the study. ICRS macroscopic scoring (0-12). Indentation test was performed to assess stiffness of repair tissue. Histological analyses was performed using O'Driscoll and Pineda cartilage scores as well as percentage tissue filling of the defects. The MPEG-PLGA/chondrocytes scaffold was the superior treatment modality based on the macroscopic surface score, histological scores and defect filling. The mechanical test demonstrated no difference between treatment groups. The MPEG-PLGA/chondrocyte composite demonstrated significantly better cartilage repair response than empty defects, osteochondral drilling and fibrin hydrogel with chondrocytes. The novel MPEG-PLGA scaffold in combination with chondrocytes need further studies with respect to longer follow-up times.",0

Methods A total of 176 patients who underwent HTO combined with a BMAC or hUCB-MSC procedure for medial compartment osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3) between June 2014 and September 2018 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were reviewed. After HTO, multiple holes were drilled at cartilage defect sites of the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and then prepared BMAC or hUCB-MSCs in combination with scaffolds were implanted in the MFC lesions. After propensity score matching based on sex, age, body mass index, and lesion size, 55 patients in each of the BMAC and hUCB-MSC groups were successfully matched. Second-look arthroscopic findings were assessed according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA) grading system and Koshino staging system. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Short-Form 36 (SF-36), and Tegner activity scores. Results At a mean follow-up of 33 months, clinical outcomes including IKDC, KOOS, SF-36, and Tegner activity scores were significantly improved in both groups (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001); however, there were no differences between the two groups. Second-look arthroscopy showed better healing of regenerated cartilage in the hUCB-MSC group (Grade I [4 cases, 9.1%]; Grade II [30 cases, 68.2%]; Grade III [11 cases, 22.7%]) than in the BMAC group (Grade I [1 case, 2.7%]; Grade II [20 cases, 54.1%]; Grade III [11 cases, 29.7%]; Grade IV [5 cases, 13.5%]) according to the ICRS CRA grading system (p = 0.040). There was no significant intergroup difference in terms of defect coverage based on the Koshino staging system (p = 0.057). Moreover, ICRS CRA grades at second-look arthroscopy were significantly correlated with clinical outcomes (r = - 0.337; p = 0.002). Conclusion There were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the two groups. Both treatments provided similar, reliable outcomes in terms of pain relief, functional scores, and quality of life at a mean follow-up of 33 months. However, hUCB-MSC implantation was more effective than BMAC augmentation for articular cartilage regeneration.",1

Magnetic resonance imaging showed large osteochondral defects in both the knee joints measuring 8-9 cm(2). Both defects were located in the weight-bearing areas of the medial femoral condyles. Therefore, simultaneous autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) for the left knee defect and ACI for the right knee joint were performed. Osteochondral plugs were harvested from the patellofemoral joint of the same left knee and grafted into the most dorsal regions of the large osteochondral defect of the left knee. The remaining osteochondral defect was covered with ACI using collagen type I and III membrane and chondrocyte cells. The membrane was implanted into more proximal part of the osteochondral defect of the left knee. Time interval between operations of the left and right knee joints was 6 months. Magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months after each knee surgery showed good preservation of the OAT and ACI grafts. The most recent follow-up examination, performed 12 months after surgeries, has shown excellent results with an International Knee Documentation Committee score of 95.59±4.64 and 96.88±4.69 for the right and left knee joints, respectively, and full range of knee motions with no symptoms. In this clinical case, the combination of ACI and OAT methods in a one-step procedure produced a good reconstruction of the joint surface with excellent clinical outcomes in the both knee joints of the same patient. Autologous osteochondral grafting and autologous chondrocyte implantation can be combined for the treatment of large osteochondral defects of the knee.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0020-1383(13)70005-6,Fresh osteochondral allograft is a suitable alternative for wide cartilage defect in the knee,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Introduction</h3> There are several surgical options to restore a wide osteochondral defect in the knee. Fresh osteochondral allografts are usually considered a poor alternative due to their difficulties in surgical application. The aim of this work is first to present our experience including the surgical technique and the functional results of patients receiving fresh osteochondral allograft to restore major knee lesions, then, to compare our results with other results presented in literature. <h3>Methods</h3> Between 2006 and 2011, we treated 11 patients with osteochondral lesion of the knee (Outerbridge IV°). The average lesion size was 10.3 cm<sup>2</sup> (range 3–20 cm<sup>2</sup>). The average age was 34 years (range 18–66). Patients were followed from 12 to 55 months (average of 26.5) through clinical examination, X-ray film and MRI every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months. <h3>Results</h3> The treatment was successful in 10 patients showing pain regression and mean IKDC subjective score improvements from 27.3 to 58.7. The IKDC objective score also improved of at least one class for each patient except the who failed. The radiographs show good osteointegration in all cases but one. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Fresh allograft is an effective therapy for osteochondral defects repair because it allows functional recovery in a considerable number of patients. This technique obtains better results in lesion smaller than 8 cm<sup>2</sup>. However larger lesion show good results. Level of evidence: Therapeutic study, Level IV.",0

Purpose: To evaluate the clinical results of a biphasic cell-free collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold and to evaluate osteochondral tissue regeneration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Thirty-four patients (18 men and 16 women; mean ± SD: age, 30.0 ± 10 years) were treated by scaffold implantation for knee chondral or osteochondral lesions of the patella (area, 2.1 ± 1 cm 2 ). The clinical evaluation was performed prospectively at 12 and 24 months via the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee; objective and subjective) and Tegner scores. MRI evaluation was performed at both follow-ups in 18 lesions through the MOCART score (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) and specific subchondral bone parameters. Results: A statistically significant improvement in all the scores was observed at 12- and 24-month follow-up as compared with the basal evaluation. The IKDC subjective score improved from 39.5 ± 14.5 to 61.9 ± 14.5 at 12 months ( P &gt; .0005) with a further increase to 67.6 ± 17.4 at 24 months of follow-up (12-24 months, P = .020). The MRI evaluation showed a stable value of the MOCART score between 12 and 24 months, with a complete filling of the cartilage in 87.0% of the lesions, complete integration of the graft in 95.7%, and intact repair tissue surface in 69.6% at final follow-up. The presence of osteophytes or more extensive bony overgrowth was documented in 47.8% of the patients of this series, but no correlation was found between MRI findings and clinical outcome. Conclusion: The implantation of a cell-free collagen-hydroxyapatite osteochondral scaffold provided a clinical improvement at short-term follow-up for the treatment of patellar cartilage defects. Women had lower outcomes, and the need for realignment procedures led to a slower recovery. MRI evaluation showed some abnormal findings with the presence of bone overgrowth, but no correlation has been found with the clinical outcome.",0

However, indications and long-term results have not been frequently reported. The purpose of this study was to determine whether bone marrow lesion on MRI are predictive of risk progression to total knee arthroplasty during the first ten years after subchondral cell therapy. METHODS: This study included 140 adults aged 65 to 90 years. These 140 patients (mean age 75.4 ± 14.2 years) planned to undergo staged-bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for medial osteoarthritis, had ""comparable"" pain in both knees, and accepted randomization of the knees for surgery. They received TKA on one side and a subchondral injection of MSCs (from iliac bone marrow concentrate) on the contralateral knee during the same anaesthetic. The bone marrow graft of 20 cm(3) volume (10 cc in the tibia and 10 cc in the femur) contained average 7800 MSCs/mL (range 3120 to 11,560). The baseline volume of bone marrow lesions (BMLs) on the tibia and on the femoral condyle determined on MRI was average 3.4 cm(3) (range 0.4 to 6.4 cm(3)). The risk of subsequent knee arthroplasty due to absence of bone marrow lesions regression as well as osteoarthritis (OA) grade was evaluated with Cox proportional-hazards ratio after control of baseline variables (number of cells injected, age, knee alignment). RESULTS: After treatment with MSCs injection in bone marrow lesions of the subchondral bone, medial femorotibial compartment BML volume experienced regression over 24 months (mean regression 1.5 cm(3), range 0.8 to 3.2 cm(3)). At the most recent follow up (average of 15 years, range 10 to 20 years), a total of 25 (18%) of the 140 patients underwent total knee arthroplasty performed at a mean of ten years (range, 5 to 15 years) after the date of the cell therapy. The overall incidence of knee arthroplasty after cell therapy was 1.19% per person-year which was equivalent to the risk of a revision for a primary TKA in the contralateral knees of the same patient population (21 revisions, corresponding to 1.00% revision per person-year; p = 0.34). After adjusting for confounders, persistent BMLs larger than 3 cm(3) after cell therapy was a strong independent risk factor for total knee arthroplasty (hazard ratio HR = 4.42 [95% CI = 2.34 to 7.21]; p \textbackslashtextless 0.001), regardless of OA grade, with higher risks demonstrated for larger BMLs. Incidence rates of arthroplasty were also higher for young patients and for knees presenting severe malalignment. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that subchondral bone marrow concentrate (as compared with TKA) had a sufficient effect on pain to postpone or avoid the TKA in the contra lateral joint of patients with bilateral osteoarthritis. Bone marrow lesions were predictive factors for future knee arthroplasty in the knee with subchondral cell therapy at ten years follow-up.",0

Chondral lesions to this area are often misdiagnosed and can predispose to secondary osteoarthritis if left untreated. Treatment options range from arthroscopic debridement to cartilage restoration techniques such as microfracture (MFx), autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and osteochondral autograft transplantation. The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the trends in surgical techniques, outcomes, and complications of cartilage restoration of the PF joint.MethodsThis review has been conducted according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses(PRISMA). The electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched from January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2018. The Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) was used to assess study quality. A two-proportion z test was used to determine whether the differences between the proportions of cartilage restoration techniques used from 2007 to 2012 and 2013-2018 were statistically significant.ResultsOverall, 28 studies were identified, including 708 patients (824 knees) with a mean age of 39.510.5years and a mean follow-up of 39.116.0months. Majority of patients were treated with ACI (45.5%) and MFx (29.6%). A significant increase in the use of the third generation ACI occurred with a simultaneous decreased usage of the conventional MFx over the last 5years (p\textbackslashtextless0.001). All techniques had significant (p\textbackslashtextless0.05) improvements in clinical outcomes. The overall complication rate was 9.2%, of which graft hypertrophy (2.7%) was the most prevalent.Conclusions ACI was the most common restoration technique. The use of third generation ACI has increased with a concurrent decline in the use of conventional MFx over the latter half of the past decade (p\textbackslashtextless0.001). Overall, the various cartilage restoration techniques reported improvements in patient reported outcomes with low complication rates. Definitive conclusions on the optimal treatment remain elusive due to a lack of high-quality comparative studies.Level of evidence Level IV, Systematic Review of Level-II-IV studies.",0

Herein we are presenting cellular and early clinical data of a patient series treated for chronic osteochondral lesions in the knee with a filter-based intra-operative bone marrow aspirate (BMA) separation device. Methods: Fifteen patients with chronic knee osteochondral lesions (60% females, 19-59 years) were included in this prospective case series. Filtered BMA (f-BMA), containing mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), was combined with a biomimetic collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold (CHAS) and implanted into the site of the lesion. Harvested BMA and post-separation f-BMA were analysed for blood cell counts, flow cytometry, and fibroblast colony forming units (CFU-Fs). Patients were followed for serious adverse events and graft failures. Clinical evaluation was assessed using the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS). In 8 patients a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/arthroscopy were performed. Results: Cell suspension contained 0.027% CD271(+) CD45(-) 7-AAD(-) cells, 0.15% CD73(+) CD90(+) CD105(+) cells and 0.0012% CFU-Fs of all nucleated cells with 86% viability. Filtration process resulted in 12.8 (4.0-40.8) fold enrichment in terms of CFU-F content in comparison to initial BMA. No serious adverse events related directly to the osteochondral treatment were reported. After an average follow-up of 20 months (14-25) all KOOS subscales (Symptoms/Pain/Daily activities/Sport and recreation/Quality of life) increased significantly from pre-operative 55/56/67/30/30 to post-operative 73/76/79/51/52 (p values \textbackslashtextless 0.05), respectively. MRI or arthroscopic evaluation revealed nearly normal to normal overall International Cartilage Repair Society assessment in 7/8 patients. Conclusion: The filter-based BMA separation procedure significantly increased the frequency of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), however their concentration was not increased. The clinical evaluation revealed high safety profile of the treatment and resulted in improved clinical status of the patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.16.01542,Condyle-Specific Matching Does Not Improve Midterm Clinical Outcomes of Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation in the Knee,"Condyle-specific matching for osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) pairs donor and recipient condyles in an attempt to minimize articular incongruity. While the majority of cartilage defects are located on the medial femoral condyle, lateral femoral condyles are more commonly available as a graft source. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients treated with non-orthotopic (lateral-to-medial condyle or medial-to-lateral condyle) OCA with those treated with traditional orthotopic (medial-to-medial condyle or lateral-to-lateral condyle) OCA. We hypothesized that clinical outcomes would be similar between groups at midterm follow-up.A retrospective review of prospectively collected data on patients treated with OCA from 2000 to 2014 was conducted. Seventy-seven patients with a full-thickness cartilage defect of a femoral condyle were treated with either orthotopic (n = 50) or non-orthotopic (n = 27) OCA. A minimum follow-up of 2 years was required for analysis. Patients in each group were matched according to sex, age, and total chondral defect size. Reoperations and patient responses to validated outcome measures were reviewed. Failure was defined as any revision cartilage procedure or conversion to knee arthroplasty.The mean duration of follow-up was 4.0 years (range, 2 to 16 years). The orthotopic and non-orthotopic OCA groups were comparable in terms of demographics, the mean number of prior ipsilateral knee operations, and the percentage of concomitant procedures at baseline. Reoperation (p = 0.427) and failure (p = 0.917) rates did not differ significantly between groups. Both groups demonstrated significant increases in the Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical functioning and pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living (KOS-ADL) scores compared with baseline (p < 0.004). Outcome scores (baseline and postoperative) and change scores did not differ significantly between groups.Clinical outcomes do not differ between patients treated with orthotopic OCA and those treated with non-orthotopic OCA, suggesting that condyle-specific matching may not be necessary.Therapeutic Level III.

The use of combined layered autologous bone and cartilage chips for treatment of osteochondral defects has shown promising short-term clinical results. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to investigate the role of cartilage chips by comparing combined layered autologous bone and cartilage chips with autologous bone implantation alone in a Göttingen minipig model. The hypothesis was that the presence of cartilage chips would improve the quality of the repair tissue. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Twelve Göttingen minipigs received 2 osteochondral defects in each knee. The defects were randomized to autologous bone graft (ABG) combined with autologous cartilage chips (autologous dual-tissue transplantation [ADTT]) or ABG alone. Six animals were euthanized at 6 months and 6 animals were euthanized at 12 months. Follow-up evaluation consisted of histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, semiquantitative scoring (International Cartilage Repair Society II), and computed tomography. Results: There was significantly more hyaline cartilage in the ADTT group (25.8%) compared with the ABG group (12.8%) at 6 months after treatment. At 12 months, the fraction of hyaline cartilage in the ABG group had significantly decreased to 4.8%, whereas the fraction of hyaline cartilage in the ADTT group was unchanged (20.1%). At 6 and 12 months, there was significantly more fibrocartilage in the ADTT group (44% and 60.8%) compared with the ABG group (24.5% and 41%). The fraction of fibrous tissue was significantly lower in the ADTT group compared with the ABG group at both 6 and 12 months. The implanted cartilage chips stained &gt;75% positive for collagen type 4 and laminin at both 6 and 12 months. Significant differences were found in a number of International Cartilage Repair Society II subcategories. The volume of the remaining bone defect significantly decreased from 6 to 12 months in both treatment groups; however, no difference in volume was found between the groups at either 6 or 12 months. Conclusion: The presence of cartilage chips in an osteochondral defect facilitated the formation of fibrocartilage as opposed to fibrous tissue at both 6 and 12 months posttreatment. The implanted chips were present in the defect and viable after 12 months. Clinical Relevance: This study substantiates the chondrogenic role of cartilage chips in osteochondral defects.",0

Methods Thirty-one knees in 29 patients (20.4 +/- 5.7 years) were treated for symptomatic unfixable OCD lesions (2.6 +/- 1.1 cm(2)) and prospectively evaluated at 2, 5, and 12 years (average, minimum 10 years). Patients were evaluated over time with IKDC subjective score, EQ-VAS, and Tegner scores. Failures were also documented. At the final follow-up, MRI evaluation was performed in 14 knees with the MOCART 2.0 score. Results Beside 4 early failures, an overall clinical improvement was documented: the IKDC subjective score improved from 39.9 +/- 16.8 to 82.1 +/- 17.0 and 84.8 +/- 17.2 at 2 and 5 years, respectively (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), and remained stable for up to 12 years (85.0 +/- 20.2). EQ-VAS and Tegner scores presented similar trends, but patients did not reach their original activity level. Worse results were obtained for lesions bigger than 4 cm(2). At MRI evaluation, subchondral bone abnormalities were detected in over 85% of knees at long-term follow-up. Conclusions Arthroscopic bone grafting followed by MACT for unfixable knee OCD can offer a promising and stable clinical outcome over time in lesions smaller than 4 cm(2), with a low failure rate of 13%. Persistent subchondral alterations were documented at long-term MRI evaluation, suggesting the limits of this approach to regenerate the osteochondral unit in patients affected by knee OCD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196779,Effects of collagen matrix and bioreactor cultivation on cartilage regeneration of a full-thickness critical-size knee joint cartilage defects with subchondral bone damage in a rabbit model,"Cartilage has limited self-repair ability. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of collagen-engineered neocartilage for the treatment of critical-size defects in the articular joint in a rabbit model. Type II and I collagen obtained from rabbits and rats was mixed to form a scaffold. The type II/I collagen scaffold was then mixed with rabbit chondrocytes to biofabricate neocartilage constructs using a rotating cell culture system [three-dimensional (3D)-bioreactor]. The rabbit chondrocytes were mixed with rabbit collagen scaffold and rat collagen scaffold to form neoRBT (neo-rabbit cartilage) and neoRAT (neo-rat cartilage) constructs, respectively. The neocartilage matrix constructs were implanted into surgically created defects in rabbit knee chondyles, and histological examinations were performed after 2 and 3 months. Cartilage-like lacunae formation surrounding the chondrocytes was noted in the cell cultures. After 3 months, both the neoRBT and neoRAT groups showed cartilage-like repair tissue covering the 5-mm circular, 4-mm-deep defects that were created in the rabbit condyle and filled with neocartilage plugs. Reparative chondrocytes were aligned as apparent clusters in both the neoRAT and neoRBT groups. Both neoRBT and neoRAT cartilage repair demonstrated integration with healthy adjacent tissue; however, more integration was obtained using the neoRAT cartilage. Our data indicate that different species of type II/I collagen matrix and 3D bioreactor cultivation can facilitate cartilage engineering in vitro for the repair of critical-size defect.",0

Mean age was 32.5 ± 9.6 years at time of surgery. Overall, 66 chondral and 48 osteochondral lesions were included in the study. Forty-eight patients were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), 27 via osteochondral autologous transplantation, five using an osteochondral scaffold, and 34 underwent microfracture (MFX). The original MOCART and MOCART 2.0 knee scores were assessed by two independent readers. After a minimum 4-week interval, both readers performed a second reading of both scores. Inter- and intrarater reliabilities were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).The MOCART 2.0 knee score showed higher interrater reliability than the original MOCART score with an ICC of 0.875 versus 0.759, ranging from 0.863 in the MFX group to 0.878 in the ACI group. Intrarater reliability was good with an overall ICC of 0.860 and 0.866, respectively. Overall, interrater reliability was higher for osteochondral lesions than for chondral lesions, with ICCs of 0.906 versus 0.786.The MOCART 2.0 knee score enables the assessment of cartilage repair tissue after different cartilage repair techniques (ACI, osteochondral repair techniques, MFX), as well as for different lesion types with good intra- and interrater reliability.• The MOCART 2.0 knee score provides improved intra- and interrater reliability when compared to the original MOCART score. • The MOCART 2.0 knee score enables the assessment of cartilage repair tissue after different cartilage repair techniques (ACI, osteochondral repair techniques, MFX) with similarly good intra- and interrater reliability. • The assessment of osteochondral lesions demonstrated better intra- and interrater reliability than the assessment of chondral lesions in this study.",0

However, the fate of the MSCs after intra-articular injection and their role in cartilage regeneration is not clear. To address these questions, this study investigated (1) homing of labeled human adipose tissue derived integrin α10β1-selected MSCs (integrin α10-MSCs) to a cartilage defect in a rabbit model and (2) the ability of the integrin α10-MSCs to differentiate to chondrocytes and to produce cartilage matrix molecules in vivo.Integrin α10-MSCs were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) co-conjugated with Rhodamine B to allow visualization by both MRI and fluorescence microscopy. A cartilage defect was created in the articular cartilage of the intertrochlear groove of the femur of rabbits. Seven days post-surgery, labeled integrin α10-MSCs or vehicle were injected into the joint. Migration and distribution of the SPION-labeled integrin α10-MSCs was evaluated by high-field 9.4 T MRI up to 10 days after injection. Tissue sections from the repair tissue in the defects were examined by fluorescence microscopy.In vitro characterization of the labeled integrin α10-MSCs demonstrated maintained viability, proliferation rate and trilineage differentiation capacity compared to unlabeled MSCs. In vivo MRI analysis detected the labeled integrin α10-MSCs in the cartilage defects at all time points from 12 h after injection until day 10 with a peak concentration between day 1 and 4 after injection. The labeled MSCs were also detected lining the synovial membrane at the early time points. Fluorescence analysis confirmed the presence of the labeled integrin α10-MSCs in all layers of the cartilage repair tissue and showed co-localization between the labeled cells and the specific cartilage molecules aggrecan and collagen type II indicating in vivo differentiation of the MSCs to chondrocyte-like cells. No adverse effects of the α10-MSC treatment were detected during the study period.Our results demonstrated migration and homing of human integrin α10β1-selected MSCs to cartilage defects in the rabbit knee after intra-articular administration as well as chondrogenic differentiation of the MSCs in the regenerated cartilage tissue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-016-4359-8,Non-operative management of medial meniscus posterior horn root tears is associated with worsening arthritis and poor clinical outcome at 5-year follow-up,"PURPOSE: Medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRTs) are a significant source of pain and dysfunction, but little is known about the natural history and outcome and for non-operative management of these lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) the mid-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of non-operative treatment of MMPRTs and (2) risk factors for worse outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients with symptomatic, unrepaired MMPRTs and a minimum 2-year follow-up for IKDC and Tegner outcome scores. Baseline and final radiographs were reviewed and graded according to Kellgren-Lawrence scores. Baseline MRIs were reviewed for the presence of meniscal extrusion, subchondral oedema, and insufficiency fractures. Failure was defined as conversion to arthroplasty or severely abnormal patient subjective IKDC score. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (21M:31F) with a mean age of 58 ± 10 years were diagnosed with symptomatic MMPRTs clinically and confirmed by MRI and followed for a mean of 62 ± 30 months. Sixteen patients (31 %) underwent total knee arthroplasty at a mean of 30 ± 32 months after diagnosis with higher Kellgren-Lawrence grades associated with increased rates of arthroplasty (p = 0.01). Mean IKDC scores for the remaining patients were 61.2 ± 21 with significantly lower scores in females compared to males (75 ± 12 vs. 49 ± 20; p = 0.03). Mean Kellgren-Lawrence grades and rates of arthritis progressed over time on radiographs (1.5 ± 0.7 vs. 2.4 ± 1.0; p \textbackslashtextless 0.001 and 78 % vs. 51 %; p = 0.01). Overall, 87 % of patients failed non-operative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Non-operative treatment of medial meniscus posterior horn root tears is associated with poor clinical outcome, worsening arthritis, and a relatively high rate of arthroplasty at 5-year follow-up. Female gender was associated with lower subjective scores and higher rate of arthroplasty. The current study provides a natural history benchmark for clinical outcomes that can be expected in patients with medial meniscus posterior horn root tears undergoing non-operative treatment and helps in counselling patients with these types of injuries.

This biological deficiency has led to a variety of surgical attempts to improve the repair of injured articular cartilage surfaces over the past 50 years. The first example of clinical cartilage tissue engineering was performed in 1987 when a knee with an articular cartilage defect on the femoral condyle was treated by implanting the patient's own chondrocytes that had been expanded in vitro into the defect in combination with a covering mechanical membrane-the periosteum. This technology is either termed autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Today, many modifications of the technique exist, from the first generation to now second and third generations of chondrocyte implantation.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2013.06.009,Cartilage Repair: 2013 Asian Update,"Despite financial and regulatory hurdles, Asian scientists and clinicians have made important contributions in the area of cartilage repair. Because it is impossible to include observations on all the published articles in one review, our attempt is to highlight Asian progress in this area during recent years (2005 to the present), reviewing research development and clinical studies. In the former, our discussion of in vitro studies focuses on (1) potential sources of stem cells--such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from marrow, cord blood, synovium, and mobilized peripheral blood--which are capable of enhancing cartilage repair and (2) the use of growth factors and scaffolds with and without cells. Our discussion of animal studies attempts to summarize activities in evaluating surgical procedures and determining the route of cell administration, as well as studies on matrices and scaffolds. It ranges from the use of small animals such as rats and rabbits to larger animals like pigs and dogs. The local adherent technique, enhancement of microfracture with poly(l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffold, adenovirus-mediated bone morphogenic protein (BMP) genes, and MSCs--whether they are magnetically labeled, suspended in hyaluronic acid, or immobilized with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)--have all been able to engineer a repair of the osteochondral defect. Although published Asian reports of clinical studies on cartilage repair are few, the findings of relevant trials are summarized in our discussion of these investigations. There has been a long history of use of laboratory-derived MSCs for cartilage repair. Recent progress has suggested the potential utility of cord blood and mobilized peripheral blood in this area, as well as more injectable bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells. Finally, we make a few suggestions on the direction of research and development activities and the need for collaborative approaches by regulatory agencies.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.d.02536,Chitosan-Glycerol Phosphate/Blood Implants Improve Hyaline Cartilage Repair in Ovine Microfracture Defects,"Background: Microfracture is a surgical procedure that is used to treat focal articular cartilage defects. Although joint function improves following microfracture, the procedure elicits incomplete repair. As blood clot formation in the microfracture defect is an essential initiating event in microfracture therapy, we hypothesized that the repair would be improved if the microfracture defect were filled with a blood clot that was stabilized by the incorporation of a thrombogenic and adhesive polymer, specifically, chitosan. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate (1) blood clot adhesion in fresh microfracture defects and (2) the quality of the repair, at six months postoperatively, of microfracture defects that had been treated with or without chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood clot implants, using a sheep model.  Methods: In eighteen sheep, two 1-cm2 full-thickness chondral defects were created in the distal part of the femur and treated with microfracture; one defect was made in the medial femoral condyle, and the other defect was made in the trochlea. In four sheep, microfracture defects were created bilaterally; the microfracture defects in one knee received no further treatment, and the microfracture defects in the contralateral knee were filled with chitosan-glycerol phosphate/autologous whole blood and the implants were allowed to solidify. Fresh defects in these four sheep were collected at one hour postoperatively to compare the retention of the chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood clot with that of the normal clot and to define the histologic characteristics of these fresh defects. In the other fourteen sheep, microfracture defects were made in only one knee and either were left untreated (control group; six sheep) or were treated with chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood implant (treatment group; eight sheep), and the quality of repair was assessed histologically, histomorphometrically, and biochemically at six months postoperatively.  Results: In the defects that were examined one hour postoperatively, chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood clots showed increased adhesion to the walls of the defects as compared with the blood clots in the untreated microfracture defects. After histological processing, all blood clots in the control microfracture defects had been lost, whereas chitosanglycerol phosphate/blood clot adhered to and was partly retained on the surfaces of the defect. At six months, defects that had been treated with chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood were filled with significantly more hyaline repair tissue (p < 0.05) compared with control defects. Repair tissue from medial femoral condyle defects that had been treated with chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood contained more cells and more collagen compared with control defects and showed complete restoration of glycosaminoglycan levels.  Conclusions: Solidification of a chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood implant in microfracture defects improved cartilage repair compared with microfracture alone by increasing the amount of tissue and improving its biochemical composition and cellular organization.  Clinical Relevance: The use of chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood implants in conjunction with microfracture can improve the structural and compositional properties of repaired cartilage. These effects may result in better integration, improved biomechanical properties, and longer durability of the repair tissue.",0

Large osteochondral defect, which consists of a severe depression fracture and a large cartilage defect, need to be treated due to deformation of the articular surface as it can impact the clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction. Although autologous chondrocyte implantation is one of the useful options in such cases, it can be questioned whether the reconstruction of the ACL and osteochondral defect should be performed in one procedure alone. Case presentation We report a case of a 38-year-old male with a deep depression fracture extending to the edge of the lateral femoral condyle associated with ACL injury after twisting his right knee while skiing. The patient was successfully treated with tissue-engineered cartilage transplantation covered by the periosteum with an iliac bone graft combined with anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction. Histopathological examination of the transplanted cartilage taken at second-look arthroscopy showed a cartilage-like tissue in the middle to deep zone in which the extracellular matrix was largely stained with Safranin O. The patient was able to return to his previous level of skiing activity without any experience of knee pain. Magnetic resonance imaging at 4 years after surgery showed that the graft integrated to the border zone and subchondral bone. The operated knee showed negative Lachman test and had a full range of motion. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with tissue-engineered cartilage transplantation and an iliac bone graft to restore the lateral edge of the femoral condyle.",0

Subjects underwent MRI (morphological and T2-mapping sequences) and completed the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire. MRI scans were scored using the MR Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) system and cartilage T2-mapping values were registered. Analysis included correlation of IKDC scores, MOCART and T2 evaluation with each other, with implant age and with previous surgical intervention history. <h3>Results</h3> IKDC score significantly correlated with MOCART score (<i>r</i>=−0.39, <i>p</i>=0.031), inversely correlated with previous interventions (<i>r</i>=−0.39, <i>p</i>=0.034) and was significantly higher in patients with longer follow-up time (<i>p</i>=0.0028). MOCART score was slight, but not significantly higher in patients with longer term implants (<i>p</i>=0.199). T2 values were significantly lower in patients with longer duration implants (<i>p</i><0.001). This trend was repeated in patients with previous interventions, although to a lesser extent. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Significant improvement with time from BioCart™II implantation can be expected by IKDC scoring and MRI T2-mapping values. Patients with previous knee operations can also benefit from this procedure.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-016-0423-y,Cost Effectiveness of Characterised Chondrocyte Implantation for Treatment of Cartilage Defects of the Knee in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Until recently, treatment options for damage to cartilage in the knee were limited to the use of microfracture or, occasionally, mosaicplasty. The developments of autologous and characterised chondrocyte implantation have provided new treatment options but have large upfront costs. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of characterised chondrocyte implantation in the UK National Health Service. METHODS: An economic model was constructed in Microsoft Excel(®), with patients undergoing either microfracture or chondrocyte implantation. Following treatment failure, patients can undergo a series of interventions, ultimately ending in knee replacement. Effectiveness and utility were modelled using clinical trial data, which were supplemented with synthesised registry data, and costs were taken from published sources. Results were expressed in clinical events, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and British pounds. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5 % per year. RESULTS: Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to reduce the lifetime probability of knee replacement by 50 % in comparison with microfracture, and to increase QALYs by 0.72 (16.57 vs. 15.85). Costs were estimated to be £23,307 for chondrocyte implantation, and £8008 for microfracture, with the incremental cost of £15,299 for chondrocyte implantation reflecting reduced resource use offsetting some of the procedure cost. These values gave a cost per QALY gained of £21,245. CONCLUSION: Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to provide substantial patient benefits over a lifetime horizon, with a considerable increase in QALYs. Despite the increase in costs, the procedure is cost effective at standard thresholds used in the UK.",0

This in vitro study aims to determine the tibiofemoral contact pressure with a contoured articular partial femoral resurfacing device under continuous dynamic pressure loads. Peak and area contact pressures were determined in eight fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens using a pressure-sensitive sensor placed in the medial compartment above the menisci. All knees were tested in the untreated condition and after implantation of the prosthetic device in the weight-bearing area of the medial femoral condyle. A robotic knee simulator was used to test each knee under continuous pressure load for 400 s during 40 dynamic knee bending cycles (5A degrees-45A degrees flexion) with body weight ground reaction force (GRF). The GRF was adjusted to the living body weight of the cadaver donor and maintained throughout all cycles. Comparison of the untreated condition to focal inlay resurfacing showed no statistically significant differences (P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) between all testing conditions. The average maximum peak contact pressure across all 40 flexion cycles increased by 5.1% after resurfacing compared to the untreated knees. The average area contact pressure essentially stayed the same (+0.9%). The data suggest that resurfacing with the contoured articular prosthetic device does not pose any immediate deleterious effects to the opposing surfaces based on peak and area contact pressure in a continuous dynamic in vitro application. However, long-term in vivo effects remain to be evaluated.",0
https://doi.org/10.5312/wjo.v8.i7.588,Systematic review on the use of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis for the repair of articular cartilage defects in patients,"To systematically review the results of studies looking at autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) in humans.A literature search was performed, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, to review any studies using such techniques in humans. Our initial search retrieved 297 articles listed on MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CINHal and EMBASE. From these studies, 15 studies meeting the eligibility criteria were selected and formed the basis of our systematic review.The study designs, surgical techniques and outcome measures varied between the studies. Although all studies reported improvements in patient outcome measures, this was not necessarily correlated with magnetic resonance imaging findings. Although there were many additional procedures performed, when AMIC was performed in isolation, the results tended to peak at 24 mo before declining.Although short-term studies suggest improved patient reported outcomes with a variety of scaffolds, surgical techniques and rehabilitation regimes, the literature remains equivocal on whether the defect size and location, and patient factors affect the outcome. Patient benefit appears to be maintained in the short-to-medium term but more high level studies with extensive and robust validated outcome measures should be conducted to evaluate the medium- and long-term effect of the AMIC procedure.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516664338,Cell Viability in Arthroscopic Versus Open Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is an effective method of repair of articular cartilage defects. It is a 2-stage operation, with the second stage most commonly performed via mini-arthrotomy. Arthroscopic ACI is gaining popularity, as it is less invasive and may accelerate early rehabilitation. However, handling and manipulation of the implant have been shown to cause chondrocyte cell death. Purpose: To assess the number and viability of cells delivered via an open versus arthroscopic approach in ACI surgery. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Sixteen ACI surgeries were performed on young cadaveric knees by 2 experienced surgeons: 8 via mini-arthrotomy and 8 arthroscopically. Live and dead cells were stained and counted on implants after surgery. The cell number and viability were assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Surgery was timed from knife to skin until the end of cycling the knee 10 times after implantation of the cell-membrane construct. Results: On receipt of cell membranes after transportation from the laboratory, ≥92% of the cells were viable. There were significantly more remaining cells (8.47E+07 arthroscopic vs 1.41E+08 open; P &lt; .001) and 16 times more viable cells (3.62% arthroscopic vs 37.34% open; P &lt; .001) on the implants when they were inserted via mini-open surgery compared with the arthroscopic technique. Open surgery was of a significantly shorter duration (6 vs 32 minutes; P &lt; .001). Conclusion: In this study, there were significantly more viable cells on the implant when ACI was performed via mini-arthrotomy compared with an arthroscopic technique. Clinical Relevance: The viability of cells delivered for ACI via an arthroscopic approach was 16 times less than via an open approach. The mini-arthrotomy approach is recommended until long-term clinical comparative data are available.",0

Hyaluronic acid-based cell-free scaffold was applied in combination with microfracture for 19 knees (group 1), whereas microfracture alone was the surgical intervention for 24 knees (group 2). All lesions were Outerbridge grade III or IV with a mean size of 3.6 ± 1.3 cm2. The mean follow-up time was 25.7 months. Visual analog scale (VAS), Lysholm knee score, and Tegner activity scale were the instruments used to evaluate the clinical status. Magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system was used to analyze the characteristics of repair tissue.Better VAS and Lysholm scores were detected in group 1 at 12 and 24 months (P = .019 and P = .025). According to the Tegner activity scale, group 1 had also better activity level at the end of 24 months after surgery (P = .020). The mean time from surgery to return to nonimpact sports activities was 7.8 months in group 1, whereas it was 9.2 months in group 2 (P = .013). Complete repair with the filling of the defect was achieved in 7 (36.8%) of the knees in group 1, whereas it was 4 (16.6%) of the knees in group 2 according to the MOCART system at 24 months.Single-stage regenerative cartilage surgery using hyaluronic acid-based cell-free scaffold in combination with microfracture for focal osteochondral lesions of the knee revealed promising clinical outcomes at 24 months of follow-up, but the clinical significance of the differences seen is simply not known.Level III, retrospective comparative study.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2018.03.011,The Effect of Cartilage Fragments on Femoral Tunnel Widening After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study,"To analyze the effect of cartilage fragments on tunnel widening and tendon-bone integration at 2 years' follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).A prospective randomized controlled study was performed in 116 patients who underwent ACLR with autologous hamstring tendons augmented with cartilage fragments (study group, n = 56) or without any augmentation (control group, n = 60). All patients were followed up for 25.6 months (range, 24-28 months), and the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and visual analog scale score were determined. Computed tomography scans of all patients were obtained 2 years after surgery to evaluate the diameter of the femoral tunnel and thereby assess the amount of tunnel widening. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation was performed 2 years postoperatively to evaluate the status of the graft in the femoral tunnel. In addition, 5 patients underwent biopsy of the tendon-bone interface at 24 months postoperatively with histologic assessment and transmission electron microscopy.A total of 107 patients completed the follow-up. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of International Knee Documentation Committee score (P = .07), Lysholm score (P = .10), and visual analog scale score (P = .57) at 24 months' follow-up. The femoral tunnel diameter and the tunnel widening percentage in the study group were significantly smaller than those in the control group (P < .001). The signal-noise quotient value of the graft in the femoral tunnel was 10.4 ± 7.0 in the study group, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (19.5 ± 9.2, P < .001). Histologic studies of the tendon-bone interface showed that there were more bone formations containing chondroid cells with aligned connective tissue in the study group compared with the control group; in addition, the diameter of the collagen fibrils in the study group was considerably thicker than that in the control group (P < .05).The use of cartilage fragments was effective in preventing femoral tunnel widening and seemed to promote the tendon-bone integration process after ACLR.Level II, prospective randomized controlled study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.b.33073,Augmentation of engineered cartilage to bone integration using hydroxyapatite,"Articular cartilage injuries occur frequently in the knee joint. Photopolymerizable cartilage tissue engineering approaches appear promising; however, fundamentally, forming a stable interface between the subchondral bone and tissue engineered cartilage components remains a major challenge. We investigated the utility of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles to promote controlled bone-growth across the bone-cartilage interface in an in vitro engineered tissue model system using bone marrow derived stem cells. Samples incorporated with HA demonstrated significantly higher interfacial shear strength (at the junction between engineered cartilage and engineered bone) compared with the constructs without HA (p < 0.05), after 28 days of culture. Interestingly, this increased interfacial shear strength due to the presence of HA was observed as early as 7 days and appeared to have sustained itself for an additional three weeks without interacting with strength increases attributable to subsequent secretion of engineered tissue matrix. Histological evidence showed that there was ∼7.5% bone in-growth into the cartilage region from the bone side. The mechanism of enhanced engineered cartilage to bone integration with HA incorporation appeared to be facilitated by the deposition of calcium phosphate in the transition zone. These findings indicate that controlled bone in-growth using HA incorporation permits more stable anchorage of the injectable hydrogel-based engineered cartilage construct via augmented integration between bone and cartilage.",0

Methods A retrospective study on patients with isolated focal cartilage defects of the knee joint who were treated with arthroscopically conducted matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation was performed. Clinical scores were assessed at baseline and final follow-up using the Tegner Score, visual analog scale, the International Knee Documentation Committee, and the 5 subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the treated knee joints were evaluated with the updated MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) 2.0 scoring system at follow-up. Results Twenty-nine consecutive patients were included in the study. Mean time to follow-up was 24.9 ± 1.1 months. Average visual analog scale decreased significantly from 6.5 ± 3.1 preoperatively to 2.3 ± 1.6 at follow-up (P < .0001). Tegner score increased from 3.1 ± 1.3 to 4.3 ± 1.2 (P < .0001) and the International Knee Documentation Committee from 43.8 ± 21.9 to 64.9 ± 18.9 (P < .0001). Also, all Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales displayed significant improvements. Patients showed similar improvements of nearly all clinical scores independent of the defect size. Average MOCART2.0 score was 70.0 ± 13.6 and 20 patients scored ≥70 points. All 8 patients with large defects (>5 cm2) scored ≥75 points. Conclusions In this small study, injectable matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation therapy in the knee joint led to favourable clinical and radiologic short-term results with significant improvements in all clinical scores and MOCART2.0 scores, confirming morphologic integrity of the transplanted chondrocytes.

Accordingly, the restoration of articular surface integrity is of major importance, especially in young adults where, in lesions left untreated or following simple fragment excision, early osteoarthritis can be anticipated. Therefore, the treatment algorithm in unstable knee OCD of the young adult foresees surgical options to restore the articular surface. Several procedures have been proposed, including refixation of the detached fragment bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft implantation, fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation, and cell-based or cell-free regenerative techniques. The aim of this review was to summarize the evidence for these surgical strategies, reporting their results and limitations. The overall evidence documents positive results for each of the assorted surgical procedures applied to treat unstable OCD, thus indicating support for their selected use to treat osteochondral defects paying particular attention to their specific indications for the lesion characteristics. The fixation of a good quality fragment should be pursued as a first option, while unfixable small lesions may benefit from autografts. For large lesions, available cell-based or cell-free osteochondral scaffold are a feasible solution but with limitation in terms of regenerated tissue quality. In this light, fresh allografts may offer articular surface restoration with viable physiologic osteochondral tissue providing a predictably successful outcome, and therefore they may currently represent the most suitable option to treat unstable irreparable OCD lesion in young adults.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.22443,Autologous resurfacing,"There is a discrepancy between the interest in joint-reconstructions and the current knowledge about the healing-processes involved. Major reconstructions are performed with osteosynthesized allografts and fresh allografts for cartilage.The main question to be answered is: what do we know about metaphyseal and epiphyseal cancellous bone healing, contact healing of the subchondral bone and its influence on cartilage healing? Can we achieve healing of all four compartments in contact?The purpose is to systematically investigate through animal testing the healing processes of metaphyseal and epiphyseal bone, including the subchondral bone and the healing of cartilage of press-fit-inserted grafts, considering nondemineralized high-resolution histology.Primary cancellous-bone healing of osteosynthesized hemi-osteotomies was studied in 13 canine tibial heads, the contact healing was investigated in 7 dogs and 18 giant-rabbits comparing contact-healing of press-fit-inserted autologs cylindrical grafts with empty defects applying the wet-grinding diamond-technology. Bench-experiments on the epiphyseal bones of swine including pullout-tests of cylindrical grafts formed the basis for validation of that press-fit diamond technology.Primary metaphyseal and epiphyseal contact healing, including hyaline cartilage, was found in all compartments of the meta-and epiphysis in the precisely performed experiments. The press-fit principle, which employs cylindrical grafts and diamond instrumentation featuring a difference of 15/100 mm between graft and recipient bed, achieved high loads between 73.48 and 178.95 N (mean value 118.16 and standard deviation 32.79) in the pullout tests.Autologous press-fit grafting with alignment of the bony baseplate using wet-grinding precision has attained promising histo-morphological results.",0

Most of these use scaffolds to achieve sufficient thickness. However, considering the potential influence of scaffolds on the surrounding microenvironment, as well as immunological issues, it is desirable to develop a scaffold-free technique. In this study, we developed a novel technique, a scaffold-free autologous construct derived from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), and successfully use this technique to regenerate cartilage and subchondral bone to repair an osteochondral defect in rabbit knees.BM-MSCs were isolated from bone marrow liquid aspirated from the iliac crest of rabbits. After expansion in culture dishes and re-suspension in 96-well plates, the cells spontaneously aggregated into a spheroid-like structure. The spheroids were loaded into a tube-shaped Teflon mold with a 5-mm height and maintained under air-liquid interface conditions. These loaded spheroids fused with each other, resulting in a cylinder-shaped construct made of fused cells that conformed to the inner shape of the mold. The construct was implanted into an osteochondral defect in rabbit knees and histologically analyzed 24 and 52 weeks after implantation using Wakitani's scoring system.Both bone and cartilage were regenerated, maintaining a constant thickness of cartilage. The mean histological score was 10 ± 1.7 in the 24-week group and 9.7 ± 0.6 in the 52-week group. There was no significant difference between the 24- and 52-week groups in either parameter of the score, indicating that no deterioration of the repaired tissue occurred during the intervening period.Using our novel technique, which employs a three-dimensional scaffold-free autologous construct derived from BM-MSCs, we successfully achieved simultaneous regeneration of bone and cartilage for up to 1 year in vivo. This method has potential for clinical use as a safe and effective method for repairing bone and cartilage defects.",0

,[Effect of marrow stromal cells derived chondrocytes on repair of full-thickness defects of rabbit articular cartilage].,"To investigate the feasibility of cartilaginous implants containing bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) derived from chondrocytes in biological resurfacing procedures for repairing articular cartilage defect.MSCs derived from chondrocytes were obtained with high initial cell density subculture. An implant was constructed by dispersing the chondrocytes in a acid soluble type I collagen gel(5 x 10(6) cells/ml, final cell concentration). A full-thickness defect 3 mm x 5 mm was created in the trochlear groove of femur in 36 rabbits. A piece of cotton soaked in 0.5% trypsin was laid into the defect for 5 minutes, then the defect was filled with MSC/collagen gel implant on one side (n = 36), filled with a plain collagen gel on the other side (n = 18), and left empty as controls on the other side (n = 18). The animals were sacrificed at 4, 8, 12, 24, 32, and 48 weeks. The repaired tissue was examined and evaluated with Pineda grading scale.In MSCs group, the implanted cells resembled well differentiated chondrocytes and were surrounded by metachromatic matrix and the reparative tissue resembled hyaline cartilage after 4 weeks; bone was formed at the base of the defects, the thickness of new cartilage was larger than tht of normal one after 8 weeks; the thickness was reduced proximally, approximating to that of normal cartilage, and chondrocyte columns was formed and subchondral bone and tidemark reappeared after 12 weeks; the thickness of the new tissue was about 55% of the normal tissue, with smooth surface and there were hypertrophic chondrocytes near the tidemark after 24 weeks; no hypertrophic chondrocytes were observed, indicating cessation of endochondral ossification after 32 weeks; the tissue architecture was the same as that at 32 weeks, hyaline-like cartilage persisting, with subchondral bone and tidemark in continuity after 48 weeks. The four layer cell orientation was not as clear as that of normal cartilage. The defects were partially filled with fibrous tissue in controls. At 32 weeks, erosive cartilage, naked subchondral bone and proliferative synovial membrane indicated the presence of osteoarthrosis. There were no statistical difference according to Pineda tissue scales in the specimens from the MSCs group between 24, 32, and 48 weeks, but there was significant difference between 4 weeks and 24, 32 and 48 weeks (P < 0.05). The joint function recovered after 2 weeks in MSCs group, while it deteriorated progressively in controls.MSCs derived from chondrocytes improve repair of large full-thickness defect in articular cartilage. The reparative hyaline-like cartilage is stable differentiation after 24 weeks, maintains good joint function after 48 weeks.",0

Purpose To test whether matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation or the original periosteal flap technique provides superior outcomes in terms of clinical efficacy and safety. Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods Twenty-one patients (mean age, 29.3 ± 9.1 years) with symptomatic isolated full-thickness cartilage defects (mean 4.1 ± 09 cm2) at the femoral condyle were randomized to matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation or the original periosteal flap technique. The primary outcome parameter was the postoperative change in knee function as assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 12 months after ACI. In addition, the IKDC score was assessed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Secondary outcome parameters were postoperative changes in health related quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey), knee functionality (Lysholm and Gillquist score), and physical activity (Tegner Activity Score) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after ACI. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the cartilage 6, 12, and 24 months after ACI and rated using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score. Adverse events were recorded to assess safety. Results The primary outcome parameter showed improvement of patients 1 year after autologous chondrocyte implantation, but there was no difference between the periosteal flap technique and matrix-associated ACI (P = .5573); 2 years after ACI, a similar result was found (P = .4994). The study groups did not show differences in the Short Form-36 categories and in knee functionality as assessed by Tegner Activity Score 12 months (P = .4063) and 24 months (P = .1043) after ACI. There was a significant difference in the Lysholm and Gillquist score at 12 months (P = .0449) and 24 months (P = .0487) favoring the periosteal flap technique group. At 6 months after surgery, a significantly lower Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair score was obtained in the matrix-associated ACI group (P = .0123), corresponding to more normal magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic findings. Twelve and 24 months after ACI, the differences between the 2 groups were not significant (12 months, P = .2065; 24 months, P = .6926). Adverse events were related to knee problems such as transplant delamination, development of an osseous spur, osteochondral dissection, and transplant hypertrophy. Systemic (allergic, toxic, or autoimmune) reactions did not occur. Conclusion There was no difference in the efficacy between the original and the advanced ACI technique 12 and 24 months after surgery regarding International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner Activity Score, and Short Form-36; however, with respect to the Lysholm and Gillquist score, better efficacy was observed in the periosteal flap technique group.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/art.30488,Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells from osteoarthritis patient-derived synovial cells,"This study was undertaken to generate and characterize human induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and to examine whether these cells can be developed into disease-relevant cell types for use in disease modeling and drug discovery.Human synovial cells isolated from two 71-year-old women with advanced OA were characterized and reprogrammed into induced PSCs by ectopic expression of 4 transcription factors (Oct-4, SOX2, Klf4, and c-Myc). The pluripotency status of each induced PSC line was validated by comparison with human embryonic stem cells (ESCs).We found that OA patient-derived human synovial cells had human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like characteristics, as indicated by the expression of specific markers, including CD14-, CD19-, CD34-, CD45-, CD44+, CD51+, CD90+, CD105+, and CD147+. Microarray analysis of human MSCs and human synovial cells further determined their unique and overlapping gene expression patterns. The pluripotency of established human induced PSCs was confirmed by their human ESC-like morphology, expression of pluripotency markers, gene expression profiles, epigenetic status, normal karyotype, and in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential. The potential of human induced PSCs to differentiate into distinct mesenchymal cell lineages, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, was further confirmed by positive expression of markers for respective cell types and positive staining with alizarin red S (osteoblasts), oil red O (adipocytes), or Alcian blue (chondrocytes). Functional chondrocyte differentiation of induced PSCs in pellet culture and 3-dimensional polycaprolactone scaffold culture was assessed by chondrocyte self-assembly and histology.Our findings indicate that patient-derived synovial cells are an attractive source of MSCs as well as induced PSCs and have the potential to advance cartilage tissue engineering and cell-based models of cartilage defects.",0

This technical note describes the method of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC), a one-step procedure combining subchondral microfracture with the fixation of a collagen I/III membrane with fibrin glue or sutures.This is a technical note on the AMIC procedure and its further development.This method is applied primarily in chondral or osteochondral lesions of the knee. Indications and contraindications are provided; the technique is described. The further development of AMIC is described with an increased focus on the subchondral zone and the complex of cartilage and bone, the osteochondral unit, which receives increased attention in cartilage research.IV.",0

For the treatment of a cartilage damage we have to consider the size of the defect, age and weight of the patient, meniscal tears, ligament instabilities and varus-/valgus-malalignment. Lavage, shaving and debridement are only sufficient for a short time and have no long term effect. Abrasio and drilling could be useful in eldery people. Microfracturing seems to be an effective alternative for small defects. The restoration of the cartilage surface with the use of autologous chondrocyte transplantation, osteochondral autograft transplantation and posterior condyle transfer seems to be an adequate treatment for younger patients.",0

In the last years many cell-based treatments have been proposed, in order to obtain good regeneration of cartilage defects. The Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis technique (AMIC(®)) combines the micro-fracture procedure with the use of a specific biological membrane. The phenotypic feature of bone marrow cell population, harvested from iliac crest and knee subchondral bone of patients treated with the AMIC(®) technique, enhanced by autologous concentrated bone marrow, was analysed to evaluate potential variations of the cell population. Samples of eleven patients, with isolated chondral lesions grade III or IV were treated with the AMIC(®) technique, enhanced by the use of autologous concentrated bone marrow. A small fraction of bone marrow samples, both from iliac crest and from the created micro-fractures, was analysed by FACS analysis and then cultured to verify their proliferative and differentiation potential. An average of 0.04% of concentrated bone marrow cells harvested from the iliac crest, presented mesenchymal stem cell phenotype (CD34(-)/CD45(low)/CD271(high)), whereas just 0.02% of these cells were identified from the samples harvested during the creation of micro-fractures at the knee. After two passages in culture, cells expressed a peculiar profile for MSC. Only MSC from bone marrow could be long-term propagated and were able to efficiently differentiate in the cultures. Although the AMIC(®) approach has many advantages, the surgical technique in the application of the microfracture technique remains essential and affects the final result.",0

Purpose: To evaluate short-term clinicoradiological outcomes of patients treated arthroscopically for acetabular chondral defects with CarGel in conjunction with MF compared with those treated with MF alone. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All patients who underwent hip arthroscopy and received MF with or without CarGel for acetabular chondral defects between 2014 and 2018 with a minimum 2-year clinicoradiological follow-up were included. Intraoperative details, postoperative complications, and clinical outcome scores, including the international Hip Outcome Tool–33 (iHOT-33), Hip Outcome Score (HOS)–Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), and Hip Outcome Score–Sports Profile, were analyzed. Serial plain radiographs were assessed independently by 2 blinded observers. A survival analysis was performed to identify the number of cases converted to total hip arthroplasty (THA) in both groups, which was correlated with the cartilage defect size at the time of surgery. Results: Eighty patients (54 CarGel and 26 MF) were evaluated, including 56 men (70%) and 48 right hips (60%). Three patients were lost to follow-up. There were no major adverse events in either group. The average defect size was 3.63 and 4.97 cm 2 in MF and CarGel, respectively ( P = .002). There was a statistically significant improvement in iHOT-33 (from 43.24 to 60.17 in MF and from 41.13 to 58.39 in CarGel) and HOS-ADL (from 62.25 to 76.75 in MF and from 44.69 to 79.16 in CarGel) scores. There was no difference between the 2 groups in the outcome scores after adjusting for covariates. Survival analysis showed 34.6% of MF cases and 5.9% of CarGel cases were converted to THA ( P = .001). The mean defect size of the failure group was higher in CarGel than in MF (8.83 and 3.72 cm 2 , respectively). Mean joint space reduction was 1.41 mm in MF and 0.19 mm in CarGel ( P &lt; .001). Conclusion: Two-year clinicoradiological results were promising in these lesions that are difficult to treat. Arthroscopic treatment of chondral acetabular defects with CarGel demonstrated a significant decrease in progressive loss of joint space and conversion to THA compared with MF as an isolated procedure.",1

Of all methods tested to achieve regeneration of hyaline cartilage and long-lasting repair, autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACI-C and MACI) has been the most successful with 80% of good results and graft survival in this unit in a very large series over 10 years. The repair mechanism is unclear but our work shows that the criteria for success are: young patient age, no previous operative procedures on the defect, no obesity, no smoking, defect on femoral condyles or trochlea and no pre-existing degenerative joint changes. Future research is aimed at non-transplantation, single-stage procedures aided by use of new scaffolds and growth factors and the extension of such techniques into arthritic joints.",0

Methods Between January 2015 and December 2019, the patients who underwent HTO and arthroscopy with MFX combined with BMAC or allogeneic hUCB-MSCs procedure for medial unicompartmental OA with kissing lesion, which was shown full-thickness cartilage defect (≥ International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade 3B) in medial femoral cartilage and medial tibial cartilage, were include in this study. Retrospectively we compared clinical outcomes, including Hospital for Special Surgery score, Knee Society Score (KSS) pain and function, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score between BMAC and hUCB-MSCs group at minimum of 1-year follow-up. Also, second-look arthroscopy was performed simultaneously with removal of the plate after complete bone union. Cartilage regeneration was graded by the ICRS grading system at second-look arthroscopy. Radiological measurement including hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, posterior tibial slope angle, and correction angle were assessed. Results Of 150 cases that underwent HTO with MFX combined with BMAC or allogeneic hUCB-MSCs procedure for medial unicompartmental OA, 123 cases underwent plate removal and second-look arthroscopy after a minimum of 1 year after the HTO surgery. Seventy-four cases were kissing lesion in medial femoral cartilage and medial tibial cartilage during initial HTO surgery. Finally, the BMAC group composed of 42 cases and hUCB-MSCs group composed of 32 cases were retrospectively identified in patients who had kissing lesions and second-look arthroscopies with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. At the final follow-up of mean 18.7 months (standard deviation = 4.6 months), clinical outcomes in both groups had improved. However, there were no significant differences between the IKDC, WOMAC, or KSS pain and function scores in the 2 groups (P > .05). At second-look arthroscopy, the ICRS grade was significantly better in the hUCB-MSC group than in the BMAC group in both medial femoral and medial tibial cartilage (P = .001 for both). The average ICRS grade of the BMAC group improved from 3.9 before surgery to 2.8 after surgery. The average ICRS grade of the hUBC-MSC group improved from 3.9 before surgery to 2.0 after surgery. Radiological findings comparing postoperative HKA angle, posterior tibial slope angle, and correction angle showed no significant differences between the groups (P > .05). Therefore it was found that the postoperative correction amount did not affect the postoperative cartilage regeneration results. Conclusions We found that the hUCB-MSC procedure was more effective than the BMAC procedure for cartilage regeneration in medial unicompartmental knee OA even though the clinical outcomes improved regardless of which treatment was administered.

https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.k.00533,"NeoCart, an Autologous Cartilage Tissue Implant, Compared with Microfracture for Treatment of Distal Femoral Cartilage Lesions","Despite introduction of autologous chondrocyte therapy for repair of hyaline articular cartilage injury in 1994, microfracture remains a primary standard of care. NeoCart, an autologous cartilage tissue implant, was compared with microfracture in a multisite prospective, randomized trial of a tissue-engineered bioimplant for treating articular cartilage injuries in the knee.Thirty patients were randomized at a ratio of two to one (two were treated with an autologous cartilage tissue implant [NeoCart] for each patient treated with microfracture) at the time of arthroscopic confirmation of an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade-III lesion(s). Microfracture or cartilage biopsy was performed. NeoCart, produced by seeding a type-I collagen matrix scaffold with autogenous chondrocytes and bioreactor treatment, was implanted six weeks following arthroscopic cartilage biopsy. Standard evaluations were performed with validated clinical outcomes measures.Three, six, twelve, and twenty-four-month data are reported. The mean duration of follow-up (and standard deviation) was 26 ± 2 months. There were twenty-one patients in the NeoCart group and nine in the microfracture group. The mean age (40 ± 9 years), body mass index (BMI) (28 ± 4 kg/m2), duration between the first symptoms and treatment (3 ± 5 years), and lesion size (287 ± 138 mm2 in the NeoCart group and 252 ± 135 mm2 in the microfracture group) were similar between the groups. Adverse event rates per procedure did not differ between the treatment arms. The scores on the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) activities of daily living (ADL) scale, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form improved from baseline (p < 0.05) to two years postoperatively in both treatment groups. In the NeoCart group, improvement, compared with baseline, was significant (p < 0.05) for all measures at six, twelve, and twenty-four months. Improvement in the NeoCart group was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that in the microfracture group for the KOOS pain score at six, twelve, and twenty-four months; the KOOS symptom score at six months; the IKDC, KOOS sports, and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at twelve and twenty-four months; and the KOOS quality of life (QOL) score at twenty-four months. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) at one year indicated that the change in the KOOS pain (p = 0.016) and IKDC (p = 0.028) scores from pretreatment levels favored the NeoCart group. Significantly more NeoCart-treated patients (p = 0.0125) had responded to therapy (were therapeutic responders) at six months (43% versus 25% in the microfracture group) and twelve months (76% versus 22% in the microfracture group). This trend continued, as the proportion of NeoCart-treated patients (fifteen of nineteen) who were therapeutic responders at twenty-four months was greater than the proportion of microfracture-treated participants (four of nine) who were therapeutic responders at that time.This randomized study suggests that the safety of autologous cartilage tissue implantation, with use of the NeoCart technique, is similar to that of microfracture surgery and is associated with greater clinical efficacy at two years after treatment.",1

Purpose: To compare the structural, clinical, and safety outcomes at midterm follow-up of MACT versus MFx for treating symptomatic knee cartilage lesions. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 48 patients aged between 18 and 50 years, with 1- to 4-cm 2 International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III to IV knee chondral lesions, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the MACT and MFx treatment groups. A sequential prospective evaluation was performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping, the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score, second-look arthroscopic surgery, patient-reported outcome measures, the responder rate (based on achieving the minimal clinically important difference for the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS] pain and KOOS Sport/Recreation), adverse events, and treatment failure (defined as a reoperation because of symptoms caused by the primary defect and the detachment or absence of &gt;50% of the repaired tissue during revision surgery). Results: Overall, 35 patients (18 MACT and 17 MFx) with a mean chondral lesion size of 1.8 ± 0.8 cm 2 (range, 1-4 cm 2 ) were followed up to a mean of 6 years postoperatively (range, 4-9 years). MACT demonstrated significantly better structural outcomes than MFx at 1 to 6 years postoperatively. At final follow-up, the MRI T2 mapping values of the repaired tissue were 37.7 ± 8.5 ms for MACT versus 46.4 ± 8.5 ms for MFx ( P = .003), while the MOCART scores were 59.4 ± 17.3 and 42.4 ± 16.3, respectively ( P = .006). More than 50% defect filling was seen in 95% of patients at 2 years and 82% at 6 years in the MACT group and in 67% at 2 years and 53% at 6 years in the MFx group. The second-look ICRS scores at 1 year were 10.7 ± 1.3 for MACT and 9.0 ± 1.8 for MFx ( P = .001). Both groups showed significant clinical improvements at 6 years postoperatively compared with their preoperative status. Significant differences favoring the MACT group were observed at 2 years on the KOOS Activities of Daily Living ( P = .043), at 4 years on all KOOS subscales (except Symptoms; P &lt; .05) and the Tegner scale ( P = .008), and at 6 years on the Tegner scale ( P = .010). The responder rates at 6 years were 53% and 77% for MFx and MACT, respectively. There were no reported treatment failures after MACT; the failure rate was 8.3% in the MFx group. Neither group had serious adverse events related to treatment. Conclusion: Patients who underwent MACT had better structural outcomes than those who underwent MFx at 1 to 6 years postoperatively. Both groups of patients showed significant clinical improvements at final follow-up compared with their preoperative status. MACT showed superiority at 4 years for the majority of the KOOS subscales and for the Tegner scale at 4 to 6 years. The MACT group also had a higher responder rate and lower failure rate at final follow-up. Registration: NCT01947374 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).",1

Methods MSCs from human bone marrow were cultured and magnetically labeled. Degenerated human cartilage was obtained during total knee arthroplasty. The osteochondral fragments were attached to the sidewall of tissue culture flasks, and magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the flasks. By use of an external magnetic device, a magnetic force was applied for 6 hours to the direction of the cartilage, and then the degenerated cartilage was cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks. In the control group a magnetic force was not applied. The specimens were evaluated histologically. Results A cell layer was formed on the degenerated cartilage as shown by H&E staining. The cell layer was also stained in toluidine blue and safranin O and with anti-collagen type II immunostaining, indicating that the cell layer contained an extracellular matrix. In the control group a cell layer was not observed on the cartilage.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546515573935,Bone Marrow Edema in the Knee and Its Influence on Clinical Outcome After Matrix-Based Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is an established method for treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects in the knee joint. Subchondral bone marrow edema (BME) is frequently observed after ACI, with unknown pathogenesis and clinical relevance. Purpose: To investigate the occurrence and clinical relevance of BME after third-generation ACI in the knee joint during the postoperative course of 36 months. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 38 circumscribed full-thickness cartilage defects in 30 patients were included in this study. All defects were treated with third-generation ACI (Novocart 3D). A standardized MRI examination was carried out after 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Bone marrow edema was observed in 78.9% of defects over the postoperative course, with initial occurrence in the first 12 months. The size of the BMEs were determined according to their maximum diameter and were classified as small (&lt;1 cm), medium (&lt;2 cm), large (&lt;4 cm), and very large (diffuse; &gt;4 cm). Clinical outcomes in patients were analyzed by use of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring system and a visual analog scale for pain. Results: There were 5.3% (n = 2) small, 28.9% (n = 11) medium, 34.2% (n = 13) large, and 10.5% (n = 4) very large BMEs. In a subgroup analysis, cartilage defects of the medial femoral condyle showed significantly higher frequency of BME than did patellar defects. Clinical scores showed significant improvements throughout the entire study course ( P &lt; .05). Clinical patient outcome did not correlate with presence of BME at any time period ( P &gt; .05). Conclusion: Midterm clinical results of the matrix-based third-generation ACI showed a substantial amount of BME over a 36-month follow-up, but this did not correlate with worse clinical outcome. Patients with femoral cartilage defects were more often affected than were those with patellar cartilage defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/4040236,"Current Trends in the Evaluation of Osteochondral Lesion Treatments: Histology, Histomorphometry, and Biomechanics in Preclinical Models","Osteochondral lesions (OCs) are typically of traumatic origins but are also caused by degenerative conditions, in primis osteoarthritis (OA). On the other side, OC lesions themselves, getting worse over time, can lead to OA, indicating that chondral and OC defects represent a risk factor for the onset of the pathology. Many animal models have been set up for years for the study of OC regeneration, being successfully employed to test different treatment strategies, from biomaterials and cells to physical and biological adjuvant therapies. These studies rely on a plethora of post-explant investigations ranging from histological and histomorphometric analyses to biomechanical ones. The present review aims to analyze the methods employed for the evaluation of OC treatments in each animal model by screening literature data within the last 10 years. According to the selected research criteria performed in two databases, 60 works were included. Data revealed that lapine (50% of studies) and ovine (23% of studies) models are predominant, and knee joints are the most used anatomical locations for creating OC defects. Analyses are mostly conducted on paraffin-embedded samples in order to perform histological/histomorphometric analyses by applying semiquantitative scoring systems and on fresh samples in order to perform biomechanical investigations by indentation tests on articular cartilage. Instead, a great heterogeneity is pointed out in terms of OC defect dimensions and animal’s age. The choice of experimental times is generally adequate for the animal models adopted, although few studies adopt very long experimental times. Improvements in data reporting and in standardization of protocols would be desirable for a better comparison of results and for ethical reasons related to appropriate and successful animal experimentation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2014.11.017,Scaffold-Based Cartilage Treatments: With or Without Cells? A Systematic Review of Preclinical and Clinical Evidence,"Regenerative scaffold-based procedures are emerging as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral lesions. In general, we can summarize most of the recent developments to reach clinical application into 2 major trends: the use of different cell sources or the application of biomaterials as a cell-free approach. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze both preclinical and clinical studies on these new trends to understand how the available evidence supports the use of cell sources or justifies the cell-free approach for the scaffold-based treatment of cartilage lesions.The research was performed using the PubMed database by looking at studies published in the English language referring to chondral or osteochondral defect repair with scaffold-based procedures until the end of 2013. The following strings were used: (""cartilage""[MeSH] AND ""tissue scaffolds""[MeSH]).The search showed an increasing number of published articles each year for both scaffold-based approaches, identifying a total of 305 articles. Among clinical trials, 116 used cell-based scaffold treatments and 11 used scaffolds alone. In the preclinical setting, a scaffold/cell combination was the most used treatment approach (133 v 45 articles), with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) being the favorite cell type. Bone marrow was the most used cell source, but other sources are gaining interest. Among articles comparing scaffolds with or without cells, the majority reported superior results for cells (71 of 89 articles). In the clinical setting, most of the articles analyzed chondrocyte-based scaffolds, with only 7 studies using MSCs; all cells were from bone marrow. Despite the lower number of articles, cell-free scaffolds are gaining popularity, with a recent increase in published studies showing promising results.This systematic review underlined the difficulties in understanding the real need for cells to increase the scaffold-based cartilage healing potential because of the heterogeneity of products used as well as the design of the published studies. Scaffold and cell combinations were the most investigated option in the preclinical setting, showing generally superior results, but in the clinical setting, both strategies remain used. In particular, although chondrocytes are the most commonly used cell type, research showed increasing interest in the potential of MSCs for cartilage regeneration. However, the difficulties in managing cell cultures, together with the development of a new generation of materials able to exploit the intrinsic tissue regeneration ability, justifies the clinical use of cell-free scaffolds, with increasing literature and promising preliminary results.Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.",0

However, it is not well known whether these procedures prevent degenerative joint disease. Hypothesis: Cartilage repair procedures prevent accelerated qualitative and quantitative progression of meniscus degeneration in individuals with focal cartilage defects. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Ninety-four subjects were studied. Cartilage repair procedures were performed on 34 patients (osteochondral transplantation, n = 16; microfracture, n = 18); 34 controls were matched. An additional 13 patients received CR and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (CR&amp;ACL), and 13 patients received only ACL reconstruction. Magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0-tesla with T 1ρ mapping and sagittal fat-saturated intermediate-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) sequences was performed to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze menisci (Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score [WORMS] assessment). Patients in the CR and CR&amp;ACL groups were examined 4 months (n = 34; n = 13), 1 year (n = 21; n = 8), and 2 years (n = 9; n = 5) after CR. Control subjects were scanned at baseline and after 1 and 2 years, ACL patients after 1 and 2 years. Results: At baseline, global meniscus T 1ρ values (mean ± SEM) were higher in individuals with CR (14.2 ± 0.5 ms; P = .004) and in individuals with CR&amp;ACL (17.1 ± 0.9 ms; P &lt; .001) when compared with controls (12.8 ± 0.6 ms). After 2 years, there was a statistical difference between T 1ρ at the overlying meniscus above cartilage defects (16.4 ± 1.0 ms) and T 1ρ of the subgroup of control knees without cartilage defects (12.1 ± 0.8 ms; P &lt; .001) and a statistical trend to the CR group (13.3 ± 1.0 ms; P = .09). At baseline, 35% of subjects with CR showed morphological meniscus tears at the overlying meniscus; 10% of CR subjects showed an increase in the WORMS meniscus score within the first year, and none progressed in the second year. Control subjects with (without) cartilage defects showed meniscus tears in 30% (5%) at baseline; 38% (19%) increased within the first year, and 15% (10%) within the second year. Conclusion: This study demonstrated more severe meniscus degeneration after CR surgery compared with controls. However, progression of T 1ρ values was not observed from 1 to 2 years after surgery. These results suggest that CR may prevent degenerative meniscus changes.",0

However, the inability to target MSCs in tissues of interest with high efficiency and engraftment has become a significant barrier for MSC-based therapies. The mobilization and transfer of MSCs to defective/damaged sites in tissues or organs in vivo with high efficacy and efficiency has been a major concern. In the present study, we identified a peptide sequence (E7) with seven amino acids through phage display technology, which has a high specific affinity to bone marrow-derived MSCs. Subsequent analysis suggested that the peptide could efﬁciently interact speciﬁcally with MSCs without any species specificity. Thereafter, E7 was covalently conjugated onto polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun meshes to construct an “MSC-homing device” for the recruitment of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. The E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes were implanted into a cartilage defect site of rat knee joints, combined with a microfracture procedure to mobilize the endogenous MSCs. After 7 d of implantation, immunofluorescence staining showed that the cells grown into the E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes yielded a high positive rate for specific MSC surface markers (CD44, CD90 , and CD105) compared with those in arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes (63.67% vs. 3.03%; 59.37% vs. 2.98%; and 61.45% vs. 3.82%, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of CD68 positive cells in the E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes was much lower than that in the RGD-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes (5.57% vs. 53.43%). This result indicates that E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes absorb much less inflammatory cells in vivo than RGD-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes. The results of the present study suggest that the identified E7 peptide sequence has a high specific affinity to MSCs. Covalently conjugating this peptide on the synthetic PCL mesh significantly enhanced the MSC recruitment of PCL in vivo. This method provides a wide range of potential applications in TE.",0

Purpose: To evaluate and compare the outcomes of mosaic-type osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) and microfracture (MF) procedures for the treatment of articular cartilage defects of the knee joint in young active athletes. This article represents an update of the clinical results at 10 years. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 60 athletes with a mean age of 24.3 years (range, 15-40 years) and with a symptomatic ACD or OCD in the knee were randomized to undergo either OAT or MF. Patients were then evaluated postoperatively using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, Tegner activity score, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging. The mean follow-up time was 10.4 years (range, 9-11 years). Results: Three to 10 years after the OAT and MF procedures, patients had lower ICRS and Tegner scores ( P &lt; .05), but both groups still had significant clinical improvement over presurgery scores according to ICRS scores at 10-year follow-up. Statistically significantly better results were detected in patients in the OAT group compared with those in the MF group at 10 years ( P &lt; .005). At 10-year follow-up, there were 15 failures (26%), including 4 failures (14%) of the OAT and 11 failures (38%) of MF treatment ( P &lt; .05). Seven patients (25%) from the OAT group and 14 patients (48%) from the MF group had radiographic evidence of Kellgren-Lawrence grade I osteoarthritis at 10 years, but these differences were not significant ( P = .083) or related to the clinical results. The ICRS and Tegner scores of younger athletes (&lt;25 years at the time of primary surgery) remained significantly higher after 10 years compared with older patients ( P &lt; .05); 15 of 20 patients (75%) in the OAT group and 8 of 22 patients (37%) in the MF group maintained the same physical activity level. Conclusion: The OAT technique for ACD or OCD repair in the athletic population allows for a higher rate of return to and maintenance of sports at the preinjury level compared with MF.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2015.12.005,Reconstruction of Focal Femoral Head Cartilage Defects With a Chitin-Based Scaffold,"It is well known that articular cartilage defects have little capability to heal. For grade III or IV cartilage defects, surgical intervention may be required for symptomatic patients. Microfracture is a commonly used surgical technique to address these injuries. However, microfracture has drawbacks, which include the risk of ossification of the newly formed tissue, as well as the imperfect and fragile nature of the fibrous cartilage. Given the challenges associated with microfracture, BST-CarGel (Piramal Healthcare, Laval, Quebec, Canada) has been developed to stabilize and support the nascent clot. This chitin-based polymer is mixed with the patient's own blood and inserted onto the microfractured defect. The polymer allows normal clot formation and provides a matrix to strengthen the clot, prevent retraction, and increase its adhesiveness to the natural tissue. We present, with a video example, a detailed arthroscopic technique for using BST-CarGel to fill a focal femoral head cartilage defect.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2796-y,A new point of view for mosaicplasty in the treatment of focal cartilage defects of knee joint: honeycomb pattern,A focal full thickness cartilage lesion of knee joint is one of the commonly seen intraarticular pathologies among the joint cartilage problems. Osteochondral autograft transfer mosaicplasty is a method which has satisfactory outcomes among the treatment preferences of cartilage defects. In spite of the favorable clinical results there are some pitfalls of mosaicplasty treatment especially in cases of large defects. One of the major problems of the classical OAT mosaicplasty is the gap spaces between the plugs. The objective of the present study is to report the early clinical and radiological outcomes and to evaluate the clinical application of a new hexagonal osteochondral graft system (HOGS) with the hypothesis of improvement of the OAT mosaicplasty method with the use of hexagonally shaped plugs. The study has intended to answer two questions. (1) Does mosaicplasty with the new HOGS has favorable early clinical outcomes? (2) Is it possible to arrange the osteochondral autografts without leaving gap spaces by using hexagonal pattern in OAT mosaicplasty?We designed a retrospective study to report analysis of early outcomes of the initial case series of OAT mosaicplasty by using a new HOGS. Six male individuals with the diagnosis of osteochondral defect and treated with HOGS and reached sixth month follow-up formed the basis of the study. The clinical status of the patients were evaluated with IKDC score. The radiological evaluations were carried out with direct X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The mosaicplasty procedures were carried out via standard surgical method of classical OAT mosaicplasty by using the HOGS following a diagnostic arthroscopy in the same session. The inclusion criteria was a full thickness osteochondral lesion of femoral condyle between 1.5 and 6 cm(2) and completion of 6 month follow-ups. The patients having deformities around the knee or major ligament lesions were excluded. MOCART scoring system was used for the evaluation of follow-up MRI findings. The clinical status of the patients were evaluated with IKDC scores.The mean age of the patients was 40.8 (±5.2) years and the mean duration of the symptoms on presentation was 16 (±4.3) months. On the initial MRI studies mean defect area was measured 3.7 cm(2) (±0.9) which was compatible with arthroscopic findings. During the surgical procedures it was possible to fill the defect area completely. The mean number of plugs in this series was 4.8 (±1.1). We did not faced with insufficient donor reserve problem in any of the cases. On the sixth month follow-up physical examination there was no limitation of the knee joint range of motion in the cases. All patients were able to bear weight on to their operated extremities without pain. The mean postoperative IKDC score improvement was 70.2 (±3.5) which shows significant improvement compared to preoperative scores. On the control MRI studies the bone integration of the hexagonal plugs were complete the cartilage continuity of the articular surfaces were intact and the grafts were well incorporated in all cases. The mean MOCART score on the 6th month MRI studies was 65.8 (±4.1).The early outcomes of OAT mosaicplasty with HOGS are comparable to studies on the classical mosaicplasty. According to our observations in this study we can say that the gap space left between the cylindrical plugs can be solved by using hexagonal prism shaped plugs.,0

A wide variety of methods involving mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been introduced. Because of the limitation of the results, most of the treatment methods have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) implantation were approved by Korea FDA. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes after two different types of MSCs implantation in knee osteoarthritis. Fifty-two patients (52 knees) who underwent cartilage repair surgery using the BMAC (25 knees) and hUCB-MSCs (27 knees) were retrospectively evaluated for 2 years after surgery. Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the score of visual analogue scale (VAS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Cartilage repair was assessed according to the modified Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (M-MOCART) score and the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) cartilage repair scoring system. At 2-year follow-up, clinical outcomes including VAS, IKDC, and KOOS significantly improved ( P &lt; 0.05) in both groups; however, there were no differences between two groups. There was no significant difference in M-MOCART [1-year ( P = 0.261), 2-year ( P = 0.351)] and ICRS repair score ( P = 0.655) between two groups. Both groups showed satisfactory clinical and MRI outcomes. Implantation of MSCs from BMAC or hUCB-MSCs is safe and effective for repairing cartilage lesion. However, large cases and a well-controlled prospective design with long-term follow-up studies are needed.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-016-4000-x,Treatment of full-thickness cartilage lesions and early OA using large condyle resurfacing prosthesis: UniCAP®,"The UniCAP (A (R)) implant for femoral resurfacing treatment of large cartilage lesions and early OA was introduced in 2006. The outcome of the present study is from a prospective cohort study of 64 patients, followed 2 years clinically and 7 years for revisions. From 2009 to 2013, 64 patients were treated with femoral resurfacing using the UniCAP implant. Indication for treatment with UniCAP implant was symptomatic huge cartilage lesion or early OA at the femoral condyle demonstrated by MRI or arthroscopy, which was ICRS grades 3-4 and more than 4 cm(2). There were 28 males and 36 females with a median age of 51 (range 35-65) years. Patients were followed for 2 years clinically with Knee Society subjective outcome scores (KSS), pain scores and radiographic evaluations and for 7 years with complications and reoperations. At 2 years, the follow-up mean KSS improved from 49 (6.9) to 88 (17.1), the mean KSS function score improved from 46 (8.0) to 90 (17.1), and the mean Pain score improved from 7.4 (0.5) to 2.3 (1.4). 47 % of the implants were revised within 7 years to arthroplasty due to the progression of cartilage lesions, progressing of osteoarthritis or increased knee pain. The reoperation rate did not show any significant difference between females and males. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 50 % at 7 years, no difference among females and males. The present study demonstrated an improved subjective outcome and reduced pain after femoral resurfacing using the UniCAP (A (R)) implant in a relatively large cohort of patients with symptomatic large cartilage lesions or early OA. A 47 % reoperation rate with conversion to arthroplasty was found. The femoral resurfacing implantation can be a temporary treatment for large cartilage lesions or early OA that is expected to develop into osteoarthritis. For younger patients who are ineligible for arthroplasty treatment, this implant can offer a temporary solution. IV.",0

The purpose of this study was to elucidate if mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected in the joints of mice with arthritis are therapeutic, reducing joint swelling and cartilage destruction.Murine mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) were isolated from bone marrow of C57Bl/6 mice and expanded in culture. Cells were tested for immunophenotype and their ability to form colonies and to differentiate into chondrocytes, osteocytes and adipocytes. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was induced by intra-articular injection of methylated bovine serum albumin into the knee joints of preimmunized C57Bl/6 mice. After one day, when peak swelling occurs, 500,000 mMSCs labelled with red fluorescent cell tracker CM-DiI were injected intra-articularly in the right knee joint. Left knee joints were treated as controls by receiving PBS injections. Differences between groups were calculated by Mann Whitney U test or unpaired t tests using GraphPad Prism software version 5.Knee joint diameter (swelling) was measured as a clinical indication of joint inflammation and this parameter was significantly less in MSC-treated mice compared to control-treated animals 48 hours after arthritis induction. This difference continued for ~7 days. CM-DiI-labelled MSCs were clearly visualised in the lining and sublining layers of synovium, in the region of the patella and femoral and tibial surfaces. By day 3, parameters indicative of disease severity, including cartilage depletion, inflammatory exudate and arthritic index were shown to be significantly reduced in MSC-treated animals. This difference continued for 7 days and was further confirmed by histological analysis. The serum concentration of tumour necrosis factor α was significantly decreased following MSC administration.Our results reveal that MSCs injected in the joints of mice with AIA are therapeutic, reducing inflammation, joint swelling and cartilage destruction. These cells also integrate into the synovium in AIA.",0

Individual study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies scale. Studies were published between 2005 and 2019. <h3>Results</h3> Eighteen studies consisting of 446 elbow OCD lesions treated with OAT surgery were included. There was a single OCA study eligible for inclusion. Patient ages ranged from 10 to 45 years. Of the OAT studies, 4 used autologous costal grafts whereas the remainder used autografts from the knee. Outcome measures were heterogeneously reported. A significant improvement in Timmerman-Andrews scores from preoperatively to postoperatively was reported in 9 of 10 studies. Return-to-play rates to the preinjury level of competitive play ranged from 62% to 100% across 16 studies. Significant improvement in motion, most often extension, was noted in most studies. Reported complication, reoperation, and failure rates ranged from 0% to 11%, 0% to 26%, and 0% to 20%, respectively. When used, knee autografts resulted in low donor-site morbidity (Lysholm scores, 70-100). <h3>Conclusions</h3> OAT surgery for large, unstable OCD lesions of the capitellum reliably produced good outcomes, few complications, and a high rate of return to competitive play. Complications are relatively uncommon, and donor-site morbidity is low. Less is known about the performance of OCA given the paucity of available literature. <h3>Level of Evidence</h3> Level IV, systematic review of Level II to IV studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2003.11.016,Retrograde cartilage transplantation on the proximal and distal tibia,"The authors, with experience with more than 400 osteochondral autograft transplantation (OATS) cases since 1996, report a new technique of a retrograde osteochondral autograft transplantation for the treatment of isolated osteochondral lesions of the proximal and the distal tibia started in 1999. We treated 5 patients, 3 who presented with painful traumatic chondral defects in the central weight-bearing portion of the tibial plateau (1 in the medial and 2 in the lateral compartment), and 2 who presented with painful chondral lesions on the distal tibia. An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) drill guide positioned in the center of the defect was used to accurately prepare the cartilage surface, in one case arthroscopically and in 4 cases through an open incision. A guide-wire was introduced and drilled through the tibia, and a cannulated reamer equal to the diameter of the defect was advanced. An osteochondral cylinder was harvested from the non-weight-bearing zone of the femoral trochlea at the angle that corresponded to the angle on the ACL drill guide. The autograft was inserted in a retrograde fashion from the cortical window into the tibial tunnel to be flush with the articular surface in press-fit technique. The remaining tunnel defect between the cortical window on the tibia and the distal aspect of the autograft was filled with a cancellous bony cylinder and secured with a diagonal bioabsorbable screw. A concomitant varus deformity with the lesion on the medial tibial plateau was corrected in the same surgery using a high tibial osteotomy to relieve stress on the graft. Patients were followed up for 6 to 35 months. A complete healing of the grafts was seen in control magnetic resonance images (MRIs). All patients were satisfied with the surgery. Control arthroscopies showed the osteochondral cylinders well integrated and flush with the articular surface.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2015.05.025,Cartilage immunoprivilege depends on donor source and lesion location,"The ability to repair damaged cartilage is a major goal of musculoskeletal tissue engineering. Allogeneic (same species, different individual) or xenogeneic (different species) sources can provide an attractive source of chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering, since autologous (same individual) cells are scarce. Immune rejection of non-autologous hyaline articular cartilage has seldom been considered due to the popular notion of ""cartilage immunoprivilege"". The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of allogeneic and xenogeneic engineered neocartilage tissue for cartilage repair. To address this, scaffold-free tissue engineered articular cartilage of syngeneic (same genetic background), allogeneic, and xenogeneic origin were implanted into two different locations of the rabbit knee (n=3 per group/location). Xenogeneic engineered cartilage and control xenogeneic chondral explants provoked profound innate inflammatory and adaptive cellular responses, regardless of transplant location. Cytological quantification of immune cells showed that, while allogeneic neocartilage elicited an immune response in the patella, negligible responses were observed when implanted into the trochlea; instead the responses were comparable to microfracture-treated empty defect controls. Allogeneic neocartilage survived within the trochlea implant site and demonstrated graft integration into the underlying bone. In conclusion, the knee joint cartilage does not represent an immune privileged site, strongly rejecting xenogeneic but not allogeneic chondrocytes in a location-dependent fashion. This difference in location-dependent survival of allogeneic tissue may be associated with proximity to the synovium.Through a series of in vivo studies this research demonstrates that articular cartilage is not fully immunoprivileged. In addition, we now show that anatomical location of the defect, even within the same joint compartment, strongly influences the degree of the resultant immune response. This is one of the first investigations to show that (1) immune tolerance to allogeneic tissue engineered cartilage and (2) subsequent implant survival are dependent on the implant location and proximity to the synovium.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603510381096,Acute Osteoclast Activity following Subchondral Drilling Is Promoted by Chitosan and Associated with Improved Cartilage Repair Tissue Integration,"Cartilage-bone integration is an important functional end point of cartilage repair therapy, but little is known about how to promote integration. We tested the hypothesis that chitosan-stabilized blood clot implant elicits osteoclasts to drilled cartilage defects and promotes repair and cartilage-bone integration.Bilateral trochlear defects in 15 skeletally mature rabbit knees were microdrilled and then treated with chitosan-glycerol phosphate (GP)/blood implant with fluorescent chitosan tracer and thrombin to accelerate in situ solidification or with thrombin alone. Chitosan clearance, osteoclast density, and osteochondral repair were evaluated at 1, 2, and 8 weeks at the outside, edge, and through the proximal microdrill holes.Chitosan was retained at the top of the drill holes at 1 week as extracellular particles became internalized by granulation tissue cells at 2 weeks and was completely cleared by 8 weeks. Osteoclasts burst-accumulated at microdrill hole edges at 1 week, in new woven bone at the base of the drill holes at 2 weeks, and below endochondral cartilage repair at 8 weeks. Implants elicited 2-fold more osteoclasts relative to controls (P < 0.001), a more complete drill hole bone repair, and improved cartilage-bone integration and histological tissue quality. Treated and control 8-week cartilage repair tissues contained 85% collagen type II. After 8 weeks of repair, subchondral osteoclast density correlated positively with bone-cartilage repair tissue integration (P < 0.0005).Chitosan-GP/blood implant amplified the acute influx of subchondral osteoclasts through indirect mechanisms, leading to significantly improved repair and cartilage-bone integration without inducing net bone resorption. Osteoclasts are cellular mediators of marrow-derived cartilage repair integration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2016.08.027,A new bi-layered scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration: In vitro and in vivo preclinical investigations,"Current treatments for acute or degenerative chondral and osteochondral lesions are in need of improvement, as these types of injuries lead to disability and worsen the quality of life in a high percentage of patients. The aim of this study was to develop a new bi-layered scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration through a ""biomimetic"" and ""bioinspired"" approach. For chondral regeneration, the scaffold was realized with an organic compound (type I collagen), while for the regeneration of the subchondral layer, bioactive magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (Mg/HA) crystals were co-precipitated with the organic component of the scaffold. The entire scaffold structure was stabilized with a cross-linking agent, highly reactive bis-epoxyde (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether - BDDGE 1wt%). The developed scaffold was then characterized for its physico-chemical characteristics. Its structure and adhesion strength between the integrated layers were investigated. At the same time, in vitro cell culture studies were carried out to examine the ability of chondral and bone scaffold layers to separately support adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. Moreover, an in vivo study with nude mice, transplanted with osteochondral scaffolds plain or engineered with undifferentiated hMSCs, was also set up with 4 and 8-week time points. The results showed that chondral and bone scaffold layers represented biocompatible scaffolds able to sustain hMSCs attachment and proliferation. Moreover, the association of scaffold stimuli and differentiation medium, induced hMSCs chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The ectopic implantation of the engineered osteochondral scaffolds indicated that hMSCs were able to colonize the osteochondral scaffold in depth. The scaffold appeared permissive to tissue growth and penetration, ensuring the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, as also suggested by the presence of a neo-angiogenesis process, especially at 4weeks. Moreover, the in vivo results further confirmed the great potential of the scaffold in tissue engineering, as it was able to support the initial formation of new bone and chondral tissue, confirming the importance of combined and innovative strategies to improve the available therapeutic strategies for chondral and osteochondral regeneration.",0

Previously, the authors implemented a novel 1-step surgical procedure for OCD treatment consisting of matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and simultaneous bone reconstruction including the subchondral lamina. Purpose: This study presents the 2-to 5-year results after this technique, assessing correlations of clinical function and cartilage and bone remodeling processes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Twenty-six patients with symptomatic condylar knee OCD (International Cartilage Repair Society OCD III/IV) were treated with matrix-associated ACI and monocortical cancellous cylinders for defect filling and subchondral bone plate reconstruction using cortical graft layers as novel subchondral lamina. Evaluations were performed with clinical rating scales and 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and a newly implemented subchondral lamina remodeling grade. Results: The defect size was 5.3 ± 2.3 cm 2 . The defect depth was 8.7 ± 2.4 mm. After a follow-up of 39.8 ± 12.0 months, all scores improved significantly. Nineteen patients (73%) reached good/excellent results in the Lysholm-Gillquist score (preoperatively: 53.2 ± 18.0 points; latest follow-up: 88.5 ± 9.5 points) and the Cincinnati knee rating score (preoperatively: 51.7 ± 13.0 points; latest follow-up: 84.6 ± 11.7 points) and significant improvements in the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score by 27.9% (preoperatively: 50.5% ± 16.1%; latest follow-up: 78.4% ± 13.4%). The MOCART score reached 62.4 ± 18.9 points. The clinical improvement and tissue remodeling occurred simultaneously and timed; thus, the cartilage defect filling and the lamina remodeling grades correlated significantly with each other, the follow-up time, and almost all clinical scores. Conclusion: The simultaneous reconstruction of deep osteochondral defects of the knee OCD with monocortical cancellous cylinders and matrix-associated ACI is a biological, 1-step alternative to osteochondral cylinder transfer or conventional ACI that leads to good clinical and magnetic resonance imaging results after an intermediate follow-up period. The present study demonstrated simultaneous remodeling processes of articular cartilage repair tissue and subchondral lamina; this synchronization is not yet understood and deserves further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-011-2107-4,A Cell-free Scaffold-based Cartilage Repair Provides Improved Function Hyaline-like Repair at One year,"Bone marrow stimulation techniques in cartilage repair such as drilling are limited by the formation of fibrous to hyaline-like repair tissue. It has been suggested such techniques can be enhanced by covering the defect with scaffolds. We present an innovative approach using a polyglycolic acid (PGA)-hyaluronan scaffold with platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) in drilling.We asked whether (1) PRP immersed in a cell-free PGA-hyaluronan scaffold improves patient-reported 1-year outcomes for the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS), and (2) implantation of the scaffold in combination with bone marrow stimulation leads to the formation of hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue.We reviewed 52 patients who had arthroscopic implantation of the PGA-hyaluronan scaffold immersed with PRP in articular cartilage defects of the knee pretreated with Pridie drilling. Patients were assessed by KOOS. At 9 months followup, histologic staining was performed in specimens obtained from five patients to assess the repair tissue quality.The KOOS subscores improved for pain (55 to 91), symptoms (57 to 88), activities of daily living (69 to 86), sports and recreation (36 to 70), and quality of life (38 to 73). The histologic evaluation showed a homogeneous hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue.The cell-free PGA-hyaluronan scaffold combined with PRP leads to cartilage repair and improved patient-reported outcomes (KOOS) during 12 months of followup. Histologic sections showed morphologic features of hyaline-like repair tissue. Long-term followup is needed to determine if the cartilage repair tissue is durable.Level IV, therapeutic study.

https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.2004.10.1818,Repair of Large Articular Cartilage Defects with Implants of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Seeded into β-Tricalcium Phosphate in a Sheep Model,"Tissue engineering has long been investigated to repair articular cartilage defects. Successful reports have usually involved the seeding of autologous chondrocytes into polymers. Problems arise because of the scarcity of cartilage tissue biopsy material, and because the in vitro expansion of chondrocytes is difficult; to some extent, these problems limit the clinical application of this promising method. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proved a potential cell source because of their in vitro proliferation ability and multilineage differentiation capacity. However, in vitro differentiation will lead to high cost and always results in decreased cell viability. In this study we seeded culture-expanded autologous MSCs into bioceramic scaffold-beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) in an attempt to repair articular cartilage defects (8 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth) in a sheep model. Twenty-four weeks later, the defects were resurfaced with hyaline-like tissue and an ideal interface between the engineered cartilage, the adjacent normal cartilage, and the underlying bone was observed. From 12 to 24 weeks postimplantation, modification of neocartilage was obvious in the rearrangement of surface cartilage and the increase in glycosaminoglycan level. These findings suggest that it is feasible to repair articular cartilage defects with implants generated by seeding autologous MSCs, without in vitro differentiation, into beta-TCP. This approach provides great potential for clinical applications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-008-0663-2,Clinical application of scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering,"The purpose of this paper is to review the basic science and clinical literature on scaffolds clinically available for the treatment of articular cartilage injuries. The use of tissue-engineered grafts based on scaffolds seems to be as effective as conventional ACI clinically. However, there is limited evidence that scaffold techniques result in homogeneous distribution of cells. Similarly, few studies exist on the maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype in scaffolds. Both of which would be potential advantages over the first generation ACI. The mean clinical score in all of the clinical literature on scaffold techniques significantly improved compared with preoperative values. More than 80% of patients had an excellent or good outcome. None of the short- or mid-term clinical and histological results of these tissue-engineering techniques with scaffolds were reported to be better than conventional ACI. However, some studies suggest that these methods may reduce surgical time, morbidity, and risks of periosteal hypertrophy and post-operative adhesions. Based on the available literature, we were not able to rank the scaffolds available for clinical use. Firm recommendations on which cartilage repair procedure is to be preferred is currently not known on the basis of these studies. Randomized clinical trials and longer follow-up periods are needed for more widespread information regarding the clinical effectiveness of scaffold-based, tissue-engineered cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546514534942,Correlation Between Clinical and Radiological Outcomes After Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in the Femoral Condyles,"Background: Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) is an established technique for the repair of knee chondral defects, although the correlation between clinical and radiological outcomes after surgery is poorly understood. Purpose: To determine the correlation between clinical and radiological outcomes throughout the postoperative timeline to 5 years after MACI. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This retrospective study was undertaken in 83 patients (53 male, 30 female) with complete clinical and radiological follow-up at 1, 2, and 5 years after MACI. The mean age of patients was 38.9 years (range, 13-62 years), with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.6 kg/m 2 (range, 16.8-34.8 kg/m 2 ), mean defect size of 3.3 cm 2 (range, 1-9 cm 2 ), and mean preoperative duration of symptoms of 9.2 years (range, 1-46 years). Patients indicated for MACI in this follow-up were 13 to 65 years of age, although they were excluded if they had a BMI &gt;35 kg/m 2 , had undergone prior extensive meniscectomy, or had ongoing progressive inflammatory arthritis. Patients were assessed clinically using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the graft using a 1.5-T or 3-T clinical scanner; the MRI assessment included 8 parameters of graft repair (infill, signal intensity, border integration, surface contour, structure, subchondral lamina, subchondral bone, and effusion) based on the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score as well as an MRI composite score. The degree of an association between the MRI parameters and the KOOS subscales at each postoperative time point was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC), and significance was determined at P &lt; .05. Ethics approval was obtained from the appropriate hospital and university Human Research Ethics Committees, and informed consent was gathered from all patients. Results: The only MRI parameter displaying consistent evidence of an association with the KOOS subscales was effusion, with a pattern of increasing strength of correlations over time and statistically significant associations at 5 years with KOOS-Pain (SCC, 0.25; P = .020), KOOS–Activities of Daily Living (SCC, 0.26; P = .018), and KOOS-Sport (SCC, 0.32; P = .003). Apart from a significant correlation between subchondral lamina and KOOS-Sport at 1 year (SCC, 0.27; P = .016), no further significant findings were observed. Conclusion: Apart from some consistent evidence of an association between the KOOS and effusion, this analysis demonstrated a limited correlative capacity between clinical and radiological outcomes up to 5 years after surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2018.02.020,Platelet rich concentrate enhances mesenchymal stem cells capacity to repair focal cartilage injury in rabbits,"It has been previously suggested that the use of regenerative promoters, which include bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or natural growth factors supplement such as platelet-rich concentrate (PRC) could promote cartilage regeneration. However, the notion that the concurrent use of both promoters may provide a synergistic effect that improves the repair outcome of focal cartilage injury has not been previously demonstrated. This study was thus conducted to determine whether the concomitant use of PRC could further enhance the reparative potential of MSCs encapsulated in alginate transplanted into focal cartilage injury in rabbits.Artifically created full thickness cartilage defects were made on the weight-bearing region of medial femoral condyles in bilateral knees of New Zealand White rabbits (N = 30). After one month, the right knee was treated with either i) PRC (n = 10), ii) MSCs (n = 10), or, iii) a combination of PRC and MSCs (PRC + MSC) (n = 10), all encapsulated in alginate. The left knee remained untreated (control). Rabbits were sacrificed at 3 and 6 months after treatment. Cartilage tissue regeneration was accessed using ICRS morphologic scoring, histologic grading by O'Driscoll scoring, immunohistochemical staining and quantitative analysis of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) per total protein content.At 3 months, transplantation using PRC alone was equally effective as MSCs in inducing the repair of cartilage defects. However, PRC + MSC resulted in significantly higher ICRS and O'Driscoll scores (p < 0.05) as compared to other groups. The regenerated tissues from the PRC + MSC group also had stronger staining for Safranin-O and collagen type II. By 6 months, in addition to superior ICRS and O'Driscoll scores as well as stronger staining, glycosaminoglycan per total protein content was also significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the PRC + MSC group (3.4 ± 0.3 μg/mg) as compared to the MSC (2.6 ± 0.2 μg/mg) or PRC (2.1 ± 0.2 μg/mg) groups.PRC enhances the reparative effects of MSC in treating focal articular cartilage injuries.",0
https://doi.org/10.4238/2014.june.18.2,Repair of articular cartilage defects by tissue-engineered cartilage constructed with adipose-derived stem cells and acellular cartilaginous matrix in rabbits,"After injury, inflammation, or degeneration, articular cartilage has limited self-repair ability. We aimed to explore the feasibility of repair of articular cartilage defects with tissue-engineered cartilage constructed by acellular cartilage matrices (ACMs) seeded with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). The ADSCs were isolated from 3-month-old New Zealand albino rabbit by using collagenase and cultured and amplified in vitro. Fresh cartilage isolated from adult New Zealand albino rabbit were freeze-dried for 12 h and treated with Triton X-100, DNase, and RNase to obtain ACMs. ADSCs were seeded in the acellular cartilaginous matrix at 2x10(7)/mL, and cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium for 2 weeks to construct tissue-engineered cartilage. Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into A, B, and C groups. Engineered cartilage was transplanted into cartilage defect position of rabbits in group A, group B obtained ACMs, and group C did not receive any transplants. The rabbits were sacrificed in week 12. The restored tissue was evaluated using macroscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the tissue-engineered cartilage group (group A), articular cartilage defects of the rabbits were filled with chondrocyte-like tissue with smooth surface. Immunohistochemistry showed type II-collagen expression and Alcian blue staining was positive. TEM showed chondrocytes in the recesses, with plenty of secretary matrix particles. In the scaffold group (group B), the defect was filled with fibrous tissue. No repaired tissue was found in the blank group (group C). Tissue-engineered cartilage using ACM seeded with ADSCs can help repair articular cartilage defects in rabbits.",0

Currently, there are several treatment strategies for these types of injuries. The possible complications and problems associated with conventional techniques lead us to investigate a minimally invasive and biotechnological alternative treatment. Combining tissue-engineering and microencapsulation technologies provide new direction for the development of biotechnological solutions. The aim of this study is to develop a minimal invasive tissue-engineering approach, using bio-targeted microspheres including autologous cells, for the treatment of the cartilage lesions.In this study, a total of 28 sheeps of Akkaraman breed were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control (group 1), microfracture (group 2), scaffold (group 3), and microsphere (group 4). Microspheres and scaffold group animals underwent adipose tissue collection prior to the treatment surgery. Mesenchymal cells collected from adipose tissue were differentiated into chondrocytes and encapsulated with scaffolds and microspheres. Osteochondral damage was conducted in the right knee joint of the sheep to create an animal model and all animals treated according to study groups.Both macroscopic and radiologic examination showed that groups 3 and 4 have resulted better compared to the control and microfracture groups. Moreover, histologic assessments indicate hyaline-like cartilage formations in groups 3 and 4.In conclusion, we believe that the bio-targeted microspheres can be a more effective, easier, and safer approach for cartilage tissue engineering compared to previous alternatives.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603510366718,Augmentation Strategies following the Microfracture Technique for Repair of Focal Chondral Defects,"The operative management of focal chondral lesions continues to be problematic for the treating orthopedic surgeon secondary to the limited regenerative capacity of articular cartilage. Although many treatment options are currently available, none fulfills the criteria for an ideal repair solution, including a hyaline repair tissue that completely fills the defect and integrates well with the surrounding normal cartilage. The microfracture technique is an often-utilized, first-line treatment modality for chondral lesions within the knee, resulting in the formation of a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue with inferior biochemical and biomechanical properties compared to normal hyaline cartilage. Although symptomatic improvement has been shown in the short term, concerns about the durability and longevity of the fibrocartilaginous repair have been raised. In response, a number of strategies and techniques for augmentation of the first-generation microfracture procedure have been introduced in an effort to improve repair tissue characteristics and reduce long-term deterioration. Recent experimental approaches utilize modern tissue-engineering technologies including local supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors, hyaluronic acid, or cytokine modulation. Other second-generation microfracture-based techniques use different types of scaffold-guided in situ chondroinduction. The current article presents a comprehensive overview of both the experimental and early clinical results of these developing microfracture augmentation techniques.",0

We, herein, report the transplantation of autologous chondrocytes ex vivo expanded using a Thermo-reversible Gelation Polymer (TGP) in a rabbit model. A full thickness chondral defect was created in one of the knee joints in each of the six rabbits of the study and autologous chondrocytes in vitro expanded using TGP scaffold were transplanted after 10 weeks.

https://doi.org/10.3109/14653240903219130,In vivo quantification of intraarticular cytokines in knees during natural and surgically induced cartilage repair,"Cartilage defects are considered to be an initial event in the progress of osteoarthritis. Reliable data about in vivo regulation of cytokines in natural and surgically induced cartilage repair are still missing.Knee lavage fluids of 47 patients were collected prospectively between August 2006 and September 2007. Five patients without cartilage lesions served as a control group. In 42 patients the cartilage defects were treated by microfracturing (19) or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) (23). Total protein content and concentrations of aggrecan, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), Insulin-like growth factor and interleukin (IL)-1beta were determined. Clinical status was evaluated using the Lysholm score.High-level expression in all knees was found for aggrecan, low-level constitutive expression for bFGF and IGF-I, while concentrations of IL-1beta in the control group remained below detection levels. The concentration of IGF-I in the knees with cartilage lesions was significantly higher (P<0.05) than in the control group. bFGF concentrations depended on cartilage lesion size; levels in the knees of patients undergoing ACI (6.1 cm(2)), were significantly higher compared with the control group (P<0.05) and the group of patients undergoing microfracturing (3.4 cm(2), P<0.001). Levels of aggrecan did not change after surgical cartilage repair, whereas concentrations of bFGF, IL-1beta and IGF-I significantly increased (P<0.01). Levels of IL-1beta significantly correlated with systemic C-reactive protein (CRP). The Lysholm score showed a medium significant negative correlation with IGF-I levels.Aggrecan is constitutively expressed in knee joints. bFGF and IGF-I seem to play a pivotal role in natural and surgical cartilage repair. Operative intervention is additionally associated with IL-1beta-related inflammation-like reactions.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061061,Treatment of Knee Osteochondral Fractures,"Osteochondral lesions (OCLs) that are frequently encountered in skeletally immature and adult patients are more common than once thought, and their incidence rate is rising. These lesions can appear in many synovial joints of the body, such as the shoulder, elbow, hip, and ankle, occurring most often in the knee. The term osteochondral lesion includes a vast spectrum of pathologies such as osteochondritis dissecans, osteochondral defects, osteochondral fractures, and osteonecrosis of the subchondral bone. When considering this, the term osteochondral fracture is preserved only for an osteochondral defect that combines disruption of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. These fractures commonly occur after sports practice and are associated with acute lateral patellar dislocations. Many of these lesions are initially diagnosed by plain radiographs; however, a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can add significant value to the diagnosis and treatment. Treatment methods may vary depending on the location and size of the fracture, fragment instability, and skeletal maturity. The paper reports a 14-year-old boy case with an osteochondral fracture due to sports trauma. The medical approach involved an arthrotomy of the knee, drainage of the hematoma, two Kirschner wires (K-wires) for temporary fixation to restructure anatomic alignment, and a titanium Herbert screw fixing the fracture permanently. The patient had a favorable postoperative outcome with no residual pain, adequate knee stability, and a normal range of motion. The mobility of the knee was fully recovered.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/03008207.2017.1402892,Chondrocyte-based intraoperative processing strategies for the biological augmentation of a polyurethane meniscus replacement,"Purpose/aim of study: Menisectomies account for over 1.5 million surgical interventions in Europe annually, and there is a growing interest in regenerative strategies to improve outcomes in meniscal replacement. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the role of intraoperatively applied fresh chondrocyte (FC) isolates compared to minced cartilage (MC) fragments, used without cell isolation, to improve bioactivity and tissue integration when combined with a polyurethane replacement.First, to optimize the intraoperative cell isolation protocol, caprine articular cartilage biopsies were digested with 750 U/ml or 3000 U/ml collagenase type II (ratio of 10 ml per g of tissue) for 30 min, 1 h or 12 h with constant agitation and compared to culture-expanded chondrocytes in terms of matrix deposition when cultured on polyurethane scaffolds. Finally, FCs and MC-augmented polyurethane scaffolds were evaluated in a caprine meniscal explant model to assess the potential enhancements on tissue integration strength.Adequate numbers of FCs were harvested using a 30 min chondrocyte isolation protocol and were found to demonstrate improved matrix deposition compared to standard culture-expanded cells in vitro. Upon evaluation in a meniscus explant defect model, both FCs and MC showed improved matrix deposition at the tissue-scaffold interface and enhanced push-out strength, fourfold and 2.5-fold, respectively, compared with the acellular implant.Herein, we have demonstrated a novel approach that could be applied intraoperatively, using FCs or MC for improved tissue integration with a polyurethane meniscal replacement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2015.06.010,Nanofractured autologous matrix induced chondrogenesis (NAMIC©) — Further development of collagen membrane aided chondrogenesis combined with subchondral needling,"This technical note introduces a further development of the autologous matrix induced chondrogenesis (AMIC©) technology for regenerative surgery of cartilage defects considering latest data in the literature. The potential of subchondral mesenchymal stem cell stimulation for cartilage repair is combined with a membrane technique to enhance efficiency of cartilage regeneration. The nanofractured autologous matrixinduced chondrogenesis (NAMIC©) procedure is suitable for the knee, hip, ankle, shoulder and elbow joints.A standardized subchondral needling procedure (nanofracturing) is combined with fixation of a collagen I/III membrane to regenerate cartilage defects. Its advantages over microfracturing are smaller holes, deeper perforation into the subchondral space, a standardized procedure and earlier rehabilitation of the patient. The collagen membrane protects the blood clot forming after nanofracturing. The NAMIC© procedure may be performed arthroscopically alone, or in a combined arthroscopic setting with a mini-arthrotomy.This is a further development of the AMIC© technology which allows earlier rehabilitation of the patient. The procedure is standardized. Early clinical results are encouraging. Nevertheless, caution is advised in the evaluation of this method as in that of any cartilage regenerating method.The development of standardized subchondral regenerative procedures is important as only reliable clinical studies will give non-biased results. The NAMIC© procedure and the nanofracturing associated with it could be a promising step. As the rehabilitation period may be significantly shortened there is an earlier re-integration of the patient into the working life as compared to the AMIC© procedure.4.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1714-7,Surgical treatment for early osteoarthritis. Part II: allografts and concurrent procedures,"Young patients with early osteoarthritis (OA) represent a challenging population due to a combination of high functional demands and limited treatment options. Conservative measures such as injection and physical therapy can provide short-term pain relief but are only palliative in nature. Joint replacement, a successful procedure in the older population, is controversial in younger patients, who are less satisfied and experience higher failure rates. Therefore, while traditionally not indicated for the treatment of OA, cartilage repair has become a focus of increased interest due to its potential to provide pain relief and alter the progression of degenerative disease, with the hope of delaying or obviating the need for joint replacement. The field of cartilage repair is seeing the rapid development of new technologies that promise greater ease of application, less demanding rehabilitation and better outcomes. Concurrent procedures such as meniscal transplantation and osteotomy, however, remain of crucial importance to provide a normalized biomechanical environment for these new technologies.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-015-2194-x,"Evaluation and analysis of graft hypertrophy by means of arthroscopy, biochemical MRI and osteochondral biopsies in a patient following autologous chondrocyte implantation for treatment of a full-thickness-cartilage defect of the knee","Graft hypertrophy represents a characteristic complication following autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for treatment of cartilage defects. Although some epidemiological data suggest that incidence is associated with first-generation ACI using autologous chondrocyte implantation, it has also been reported in other technical modifications of ACI using different biomaterials. Nevertheless, it has not been described in autologous, non-periosteum, implant-free associated ACI. In addition, little is known about histological and T2-relaxation appearance of graft hypertrophy. The present case report provides a rare case of extensive graft hypertrophy following ACI using an autologous spheres technique with clinical progression over time. Detailed clinical, MR tomographic and histological evaluation has been performed, which demonstrates a high quality of repair tissue within the hypertrophic as well as non-hypertrophic transplanted areas of the repair tissue. No expression of collagen type X (a sign of chondrocyte hypertrophy), only slight changes of the subchondral bone and a nearly normal cell-matrix ratio suggest that tissue within the hypertrophic area does not significantly differ from intact and high-quality repair tissue and therefore seems not to cause graft hypertrophy. This is in contrast to the assumption that histological hypertrophy might cause or contribute to an overwhelming growth of the repair tissue within the transplantation site. Data presented in this manuscript might contribute to further explain the etiology of graft hypertrophy following ACI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jfas.2017.09.009,Arthroscopic Treatment of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus Using Juvenile Articular Cartilage Allograft and Autologous Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentration,"Juvenile allogenic chondrocyte implantation (JACI; DeNovo NT Natural Tissue Graft®; Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) with autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) is a relatively new all-arthroscopic procedure for treating critical-size osteochondral lesions (OCLs) of the talus. Few studies have investigated the clinical and radiographic outcomes of this procedure. We collected the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients who had undergone JACI-BMAC for talar OCLs to assess treatment efficacy and cartilage repair tissue quality using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Forty-six patients with critical-size OCLs (≥6 mm widest diameter) received JACI-BMAC from 2012 to 2014. We performed a retrospective medical record review and assessed the functional outcomes pre- and postoperatively using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Short-Form 12-item general health questionnaire. MRI was performed preoperatively and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Cartilage morphology was evaluated on postoperative MRI scans using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage tissue (MOCART) score. The pre- to postoperative changes and relationships between outcomes and lesion size, bone grafting, lesion location, instability, hypertrophy, and MOCART scores were analyzed. Overall, the mean questionnaire scores improved significantly, with almost every FAOS subscale showing significant improvement postoperatively. Concurrent instability resulted in more changes that were statistically significant. The use of bone grafting and the presence of hypertrophy did not result in statistically significant changes in the outcomes. Factors associated with outcomes were lesion size and hypertrophy. Increasing lesion size was associated with decreased FAOS quality of life subscale and hypertrophy correlating with changes in the pain subscale. Of the 46 patients, 22 had undergone postoperative MRI scans that were scored. The average MOCART score was 46.8. Most patients demonstrated a persistent bone marrow edema pattern and hypertrophy of the reparative cartilage. Juvenile articular cartilage implantation of the DeNovo NT allograft and BMAC resulted in improved functional outcome scores; however, the reparative tissue still exhibited fibrocartilage composition radiographically. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term outcomes and determine the superiority of the arthroscopic DeNovo procedure compared with microfracture and other cartilage resurfacing procedures.",0

The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a single-stage procedure incorporating a new cell-free collagen type I gel for the treatment of small chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee evaluated at 2-year follow-up. Fifteen patients were treated with a cell-free collagen type I gel matrix of 11 mm diameter. The grafts were implanted in the debrided cartilage defect and fixed by press-fit only. The clinical outcome was assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, and 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner activity scale and visual analogue scale (VAS). Graft attachment rate was assessed 6 weeks postoperatively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cartilage regeneration was evaluated using the Magnetic Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score at 6, 12 and 24 months after implantation. Clinical results were correlated with MRI findings. Six male and nine female patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 26 (range: 19-40). No complications were reported. The mean VAS values after 6 weeks and the mean IKDC patient values after 6 months were significantly improved from the preoperative values (P = 0.005 and P = 0.009, respectively). This improvement remained up to the latest follow-up. There were no significant differences between the median preoperative and postoperative Tegner values (n.s.). Significant improvement of the mean MOCART score was observed after 12 months and remained by 24 months (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). MR images showed that in 14 of the 15 patients, the graft was completely attached by 6 weeks postoperatively. At 24 months after implantation, MRI demonstrated complete filling in all cases with a mainly smooth surface, complete integration of the border zone, homogenous structure of the repaired tissue and nearly normal signal intensity. No correlation between any variables of the MOCART score and the clinical scores was observed. The present study reveals that the new method produces both good clinical and magnetic resonance imaging results. Use of press-fit only implanted grafts of a smaller diameter leads to a high attachment rate at 24-month follow-up. IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.09.011,Tropoelastin improves adhesion and migration of intra-articular injected infrapatellar fat pad MSCs and reduces osteoarthritis progression,"Intra-articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising strategy for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. However, more and more studies reveal that the injected MSCs have poor adhesion, migration, and survival in the joint cavity. A recent study shows that tropoelastin (TE) regulates adhesion, proliferation and phenotypic maintenance of MSCs as a soluble additive, indicating that TE could promote MSCs-homing in regenerative medicine. In this study, we used TE as injection medium, and compared it with classic media in MSCs intra-articular injection such as normal saline (NS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). We found that TE could effectively improve adhesion, migration, chondrogenic differentiation of infrapatellar fat pad MSCs (IPFP-MSCs) and enhance matrix synthesis of osteoarthritic chondrocytes (OACs) in indirect-coculture system. Moreover, TE could significantly enhance IPFP-MSCs adhesion via activation of integrin β1, ERK1/2 and vinculin (VCL) in vitro. In addition, intra-articular injection of TE-IPFP MSCs suspension resulted in a short-term increase in survival rate of IPFP-MSCs and better histology scores of rat joint tissues. Inhibition of integrin β1 or ERK1/2 attenuated the protective effect of TE-IPFP MSCs suspension in vivo. In conclusion, TE promotes performance of IPFP-MSCs and protects knee cartilage from damage in OA through enhancement of cell adhesion and activation of integrin β1/ERK/VCL pathway. Our ﬁndings may provide new insights in MSCs intra-articular injection for OA treatment.",0

Purpose: To evaluate the correlation between MRI and clinical outcome after cartilage repair and to identify parameters that are most important in determining clinical outcome. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Collaboration. Articles were screened for relevance and appraised for quality. Guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Statement were used. Chi-square tests were performed to find variables that could determine correlation between clinical and radiological parameters. Results: A total of 32 articles (total number of patients, 1019) were included. A majority (81%) were case series or cohort studies that used similar standardized MRI techniques. The mean Coleman score was 63 (range, 42-96). For the majority of MRI parameters, limited or no correlation was found. Nine studies (28%) found a correlation between clinical outcome and the composite magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) or Henderson score and 7 (22%) with defect fill. In 5 studies, a weak to moderate correlation was found between clinical outcome and the T2 index (mean Pearson coefficient r = .53). Conclusion: Strong evidence to determine whether morphological MRI is reliable in predicting clinical outcome after cartilage repair is lacking. Future research aiming specifically at clinical sensitivity of advanced morphological and biochemical MRI techniques after articular cartilage repair could be of great importance to the field.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/nmat2999,Nanofibrous hollow microspheres self-assembled from star-shaped polymers as injectable cell carriers for knee repair,"To repair complexly shaped tissue defects, an injectable cell carrier is desirable to achieve an accurate fit and to minimize surgical intervention. However, the injectable carriers available at present have limitations, and are not used clinically for cartilage regeneration. Here, we report nanofibrous hollow microspheres self-assembled from star-shaped biodegradable polymers as an injectable cell carrier. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres, integrating the extracellular-matrix-mimicking architecture with a highly porous injectable form, were shown to efficiently accommodate cells and enhance cartilage regeneration, compared with control microspheres. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres also supported a significantly larger amount of, and higher-quality, cartilage regeneration than the chondrocytes-alone group in an ectopic implantation model. In a critical-size rabbit osteochondral defect-repair model, the nanofibrous hollow microspheres/chondrocytes group achieved substantially better cartilage repair than the chondrocytes-alone group that simulates the clinically available autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure. These results indicate that the nanofibrous hollow microspheres are an excellent injectable cell carrier for cartilage regeneration.",0

Although clinical evidence has been collected for different resurfacing types, the in vivo post-operative knee kinematics remain unknown. The present study aims to analyze the knee kinematics in subjects with patient-specific episealer implants. This study hypothesized that patient-specific resurfacing implants would lead to knee kinematics close to healthy knees, resulting in medial pivot and a high degree of femoral rollback during flexion.Retrospective study design. Fluoroscopic analysis during unloaded flexion-extension and loaded lunge was conducted at > 12 months post-surgery in ten episealer knees, and compared to ten healthy knees. Pre- and post-operative clinical data of the episealer knees were collected using a visual analog scale (VAS), the EQ 5d Health, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaires.A consistent medial pivot was observed in both episealer and healthy knees. Non-significant differences were found in the unloaded (p = 0.15) and loaded (p = 0.51) activities. Although lateral rollback was observed in both groups, it was significantly higher for the episealer knees in both the unloaded (p = 0.02) and loaded (p = 0.01) activities. Coupled axial rotation was significantly higher in the unloaded (p = 0.001) but not in the loaded (p = 0.06) activity in the episealer knees. Improved scores were observed at 1-year post-surgery in the episealer subjects for the VAS (p = 0.001), KOOS (p = 0.001) and EQ Health (p = 0.004).At 12 month follow-up, a clear physiological knee kinematics pattern of medial pivot, lateral femoral rollback and coupled axial external femoral rotation during flexion was observed in patients treated with an episealer resurfacing procedure. However, higher femoral rollback and axial external rotation in comparison to healthy knees was observed, suggesting possible post-operative muscle weakness and consequent insufficient stabilization at high flexion.",0
https://doi.org/10.5301/ijao.5000457,Implantation of a Polycaprolactone Scaffold with Subchondral Bone Anchoring Ameliorates Nodules Formation and Other Tissue Alterations,"Purpose Articular cartilage has limited repair capacity. Two different implant devices for articular cartilage regeneration were tested in vivo in a sheep model to evaluate the effect of subchondral bone anchoring for tissue repair. Methods The implants were placed with press-fit technique in a cartilage defect after microfracture surgery in the femoral condyle of the knee joint of the sheep and histologic and mechanical evaluation was done 4.5 months later. The first group consisted of a biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with double porosity. The second test group consisted of a PCL scaffold attached to a poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) pin anchored to the subchondral bone. Results For both groups most of the defects (75%) showed an articular surface that was completely or almost completely repaired with a neotissue. Nevertheless, the surface had a rougher appearance than controls and the repair tissue was immature. In the trials with solely scaffold implantation, severe subchondral bone alterations were seen with many large nodular formations. These alterations were ameliorated when implanting the scaffold with a subchondral bone anchoring pin. Discussions The results show that tissue repair is improved by implanting a PCL scaffold compared to solely microfracture surgery, and most importantly, that subchondral bone alterations, normally seen after microfracture surgery, were partially prevented when implanting the PCL scaffold with a fixation system to the subchondral bone.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.04.033,Fabrication of nanofibrous microcarriers mimicking extracellular matrix for functional microtissue formation and cartilage regeneration,"Cartilage has rather limited capacities for self-repair and regeneration. To repair complexly shaped cartilage tissue defects, we propose the application of microtissues fabricated from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) cultured in natural bionic nanofibrous microcarriers (NF-MCs). The NF-MCs were structurally and functionally designed to mimic natural extracellular matrix (ECM) by crosslinking dialdehyde bacterial cellulose (DBC) with DL-allo-hydroxylysine (DHYL) and complexing chitosan (CS) with DHYL through electrostatic interactions. The orthogonal design allows for fine tuning of fiber diameter, pore size, porosity, mechanical properties, and biodegradation rate of the NF-MC. BMSCs cultured in NF-MCs showed improved proliferation compared with those cultured in chitosan microcarriers (CS-MCs). After three-week culture under microgravity conditions, functional cartilage microtissues were generated. When implanted into a knee articular cartilage defect in mice, the microtissue showed superior in vivo cartilage repair as characterized by cell tracking, histology, micro CT image, and gait analysis. Versatile in natural biopolymer design and biomimetic in nanofibrous component embedded in macroporous microcarriers, these injectable NC-MCs demonstrate to be effective carriers for cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, the functional microtissues also show their prospect in repair of cartilage tissue, and suggest their potential for other tissues in general.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2019.09.004,Editorial Commentary: Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation Versus Microfracture for Knee Articular Cartilage Repair: We Should Focus on the Latest Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation Techniques,"The clinical efficacy of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) versus microfracture (MFx) for repair of articular cartilage lesions in the knee has gained significant attention in the orthopaedic sports medicine community in recent years. Bone marrow stimulation with MFx often is considered a first-line treatment option, given the ease and low cost of the procedure, as well as the good short-term outcomes. However, multiple studies have recently shown the outcomes of knee MFx to worsen after 5 years postoperatively, particularly for larger lesions. Because of this, ACI has been proposed as a first-line rather than salvage procedure for focal chondral defects in the knee. Although it is important to understand the differences in clinical outcomes between ACI and MFx at mid-term follow-up, longer-term outcomes need to be further investigated. In addition, it may be more appropriate to focus on the comparison of MFx with newer-generation techniques of chondrocyte implantation matrix–associated ACI rather than a collation of historical 2-step ACI using periosteum and newer techniques.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.06.027,Suppressing mesenchymal stem cell hypertrophy and endochondral ossification in 3D cartilage regeneration with nanofibrous poly(l-lactic acid) scaffold and matrilin-3,"Articular cartilage has a very limited ability to self-heal after injury or degeneration due to its low cellularity, poor proliferative activity, and avascular nature. Current clinical options are able to alleviate patient suffering, but cannot sufficiently regenerate the lost tissue. Biomimetic scaffolds that recapitulate the important features of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage are hypothesized to be advantageous in supporting cell growth, chondrogenic differentiation, and integration of regenerated cartilage with native cartilage, ultimately restoring the injured tissue to its normal function. It remains a challenge to support and maintain articular cartilage regenerated by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which are prone to hypertrophy and endochondral ossification after implantation in vivo. In the present work, a nanofibrous poly(l-lactic acid) (NF PLLA) scaffold developed by our group was utilized because of the desired highly porous structure, high interconnectivity, and collagen-like NF architecture to support rabbit BMSCs for articular cartilage regeneration. We further hypothesized that matrilin-3 (MATN3), a non-collagenous, cartilage-specific ECM protein, would enhance the microenvironment of the NF PLLA scaffold for cartilage regeneration and maintain the cartilage property. To test this hypothesis, we seeded BMSCs on the NF PLLA scaffold with or without MATN3. We found that MATN3 suppresses hypertrophy in this 3D culture system in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation of the chondrogenic cell/scaffold constructs in a nude mouse model showed that pretreatment with MATN3 was able to maintain chondrogenesis and prevent hypertrophy and endochondral ossification in vivo. These results demonstrate that the porous NF PLLA scaffold treated with MATN3 represents an advantageous 3D microenvironment for cartilage regeneration and phenotype maintenance, and is a promising strategy for articular cartilage repair.Articular cartilage defects, caused by trauma, inflammation, or joint instability, may ultimately lead to debilitating pain and disability. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are an attractive cell source for articular cartilage tissue engineering. However, chondrogenic induction of BMSCs is often accompanied by undesired hypertrophy, which can lead to calcification and ultimately damage the cartilage. Therefore, a therapy to prevent hypertrophy and endochondral ossification is of paramount importance to adequately regenerate articular cartilage. We hypothesized that MATN3 (a non-collagenous ECM protein expressed exclusively in cartilage) may improve regeneration of articular cartilage with BMSCs by maintaining chondrogenesis and preventing hypertrophic transition in an ECM mimicking nanofibrous scaffold. Our results showed that the administration of MATN3 to the cell/nanofibrous scaffold constructs favorably maintained chondrogenesis and prevented hypertrophy/endochondral ossification in the chondrogenic constructs in vitro and in vivo. The combination of nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds and MATN3 treatment provides a very promising strategy to generate chondrogenic grafts with phenotypic stability for articular cartilage repair.",0
,Is MRI useful in the early follow-up after autologous osteochondral transplantation?,"The study was carried out to evaluate MRI findings following osteochondral auto-grafting in femoral condyles and talus, and to correlate these with the clinical outcome. Thirty-three patients (20 knees, 13 ankles) were examined 1 to 4 years after operation using MRI, Lysholm Knee Score and Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Score. Clinical examination showed pain relief and improved function and MRI images demonstrated graft incorporation. Radiological criteria such as articular step-off, subchondral lamina irregularity, subchondral oedema and inhomogeneity of the graft interface opposed to the host tissue do not correlate statistically with the clinical outcome. MRI is a well-recognised, useful diagnostic tool to assess the articular surface but it has a limited clinical significance in the early post-operative stages after autologous osteochondral transplantation. The long-term prognostic significance of unsatisfying MRI results is unknown.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6048477,Platelet-Rich Plasma and Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Association with Arthroscopic Microfracture of Knee Articular Cartilage Defects: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"This study aims to compare the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) alone or in combination with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) in patients affected by cartilage defects, undergoing knee arthroscopic microfracture.Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with a knee monocompartmental cartilage defect (Outerbridge grade IV) on the MRI, underwent an arthroscopic procedure. After the confirmation of the lesion, they all received the same bone marrow stimulation technique (microfracture) and were randomized into two groups: the first one had additional PRP injection (group A), while the second received PRP and AD-MSC injection (group B). Knee assessment and pain score were documented with Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Short-Form (SF) 12, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before the treatment and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up postoperatively. An additional arthroscopic procedure, performed in four patients for a subsequent meniscal lesion, let us evaluate cartilage evolution by performing a macro/microscopical assessment on cartilage biopsy specimens.At the 12-month follow-up, both groups showed a comparable functional improvement. The scores on the IKDC form, KOOS, pain VAS, and SF-12 significantly improved from baseline (p < 0.05) to 12 months postoperatively in both treatment groups. The four second-look arthroscopies showed a complete repair of the articular defects by smooth solid cartilage layer, with a good chondrocytic population, in both groups. A thick smooth hyaline-like cartilage with a predominantly viable cell population and normal mineralization (a form closely resembling native tissue) was observed in group B.Modern regenerative medicine techniques, such as PRP and AD-MSC, associated with traditional arthroscopic bone marrow stimulating techniques, seem to enhance cartilage restoration ability. The preliminary results of this pilot study encourage the synergic use of these regenerative modulating systems to improve the quality of the regenerated cartilage.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-021-04075-9,Comparative efficacy of osteochondral autologous transplantation and microfracture in the knee: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"INTRODUCTION: More than 19% of patients undergoing knee arthroscopies suffers from articular cartilage defects. The chondral or osteochondral lesion has negative impacts on the knee joints function and the life quality of patients. However, the treatment remains challenging as hyaline cartilage is not renewable. The purpose of this study was to systematically analyze the data of randomized controlled trials for comparing the postoperative outcomes between osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) and microfracture (MF) procedure. We hypothesized that the outcomes were better in OAT than MF procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search of the EMBASE, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The outcome measures include: the rate of excellent or good results, the rate of return to sports, the failure rate, osteoarthritis rate, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, Lysholm Knee Score, and Tegner scale. The statistical analysis was completed using Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.3) software. RESULTS: The systematic search identified 7 studies with a total of 346 patients. The pooled result showed significant differences between the two groups in the rate of return to sports and failure. The following outcome scores showed significant improvement (pre- vs postoperatively): Lysholm score (p = 0.02), Tegner scale (p \textbackslashtextless 0.00001), and ICRS score (p \textbackslashtextless 0.00001). The differences were not significant in the excellent or good results and the rate of osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: The patients in OAT group may return to play quicker, even return to pre-injury level of activity compared to the MF group. OAT is better than MF procedure in accordance with Lysholm score, Tegner score, ICRS score, and the rate of failure. However, few studies have reported long-term outcomes and there has no uniform criteria for safe return to sports. Further research is needed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/app11167309,Is Microfracture Alone Enough?,"The technique of microfracture (MFX) was first performed 40 years ago and served for many years as the main procedure for repairing cartilage defects. There is a need to improve microfractures because the regenerated cartilage differs from the original histological aspect; it is less hyaline and more fibrocartilaginous. In addition, and more importantly, the benefits do not persist and the long-term results are unsatisfactory. Adjunctive treatments include platelet-rich plasma (PRP), cell-free-based scaffolds, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). The aim of this review was to provide an overview and a perspective of the available data regarding MFX and the principal adjunctive treatments from recent years and also to challenge the traditional MFX procedure. We found that cell-free scaffolds, platelet-rich plasma, and bone marrow aspirate concentrate, although they are relatively novel therapies, showed great potential and maintained their clinical benefits for longer periods of time compared to microfracture alone. As for chitosan-based therapy and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, we were not able to form a definitive conclusion. We believe that the available data show promising results, and future research should be done on each topic discussed. Moreover, investigators involved in bone marrow stimulation techniques should focus on conducting prospective comparative studies, performing second-look arthroscopy, and rely on a single enhancement procedure that can be adequately compared with MFX alone.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2012.06.014,Comparison of Mini-Open Versus Arthroscopic Harvesting of Osteochondral Autografts in the Knee: A Cadaveric Study,"<h3>Purpose</h3> To prove that the assessment of osteochondral graft perpendicularity with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will allow for a precise measurement of graft perpendicularity and for an improved comparison of arthroscopic versus mini-open harvest techniques. <h3>Methods</h3> Ten fresh cadaveric knees (mean age, 39.4 years) underwent harvest of 6-mm osteochondral plugs using the Osteochondral Autograft Transfer System (OATS; Arthrex, Naples, FL). A total of 8 plugs were harvested per knee from 3 donor sites: the lateral supracondylar ridge, the medial supracondylar ridge, and the lateral intercondylar notch. Two surgeons performed the graft harvest, alternating between mini-open (5 specimens) and arthroscopic (5 specimens) techniques to minimize bias. The osteochondral plugs were labeled and plated by a novel agar plating technique and then underwent MRI for measurement of graft perpendicularity. The data were analyzed to look for a significant difference in perpendicularity between the 2 harvest techniques, as well as overall graft acceptability. <h3>Results</h3> One specimen in the open harvest technique group was unable to undergo optimal MRI because of difficulties encountered with the novel agar plating system resulting in graft movement during imaging. When we compared the mini-open and arthroscopic harvest techniques, the mean angle of perpendicularity at the lateral intercondylar notch harvest site was 84.1° and 84.2°, respectively (<i>P</i> = .958). At the medial supracondylar ridge harvest site, the mean angle of perpendicularity for the mini-open and arthroscopic techniques was 88.4° and 81.0°, respectively, with a mean difference of 7.4° (<i>P</i> = .006). At the lateral supracondylar ridge harvest site, the mean angle of perpendicularity for the mini-open and arthroscopic techniques was 85.7° and 87.1°, respectively (<i>P</i> = .237). <h3>Conclusions</h3> A significant difference in osteochondral autograft perpendicularity was noted at the medial supracondylar ridge when we compared the mini-open and arthroscopic harvesting techniques. This suggests that when one is harvesting autologous osteochondral grafts from the medial supracondylar ridge, the mini-open technique may be preferred. <h3>Clinical Relevance</h3> When harvesting autologous osteochondral grafts from the medial supracondylar ridge of the knee, the mini-open technique will potentially allow for a more perpendicular graft for implantation.",0
https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.907150,Cross-Coupling Effects of Silencing of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/Aggrecanase-1 and Over-Expressed Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in an Osteoarthritis Animal Model,"BACKGROUND:This study aimed to observe the effect of lentivirus-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 and aggrecanase-1 silencing and insulin-like growth factor-1 overexpression in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells after injection into model osteoarthritic knees. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Using genetic recombination technique, the genes of cyclooxygenase-2, aggrecanase-1, and insulin-like growth factor-1 were recombined into the lentiviral vectors, and we transfected the human bone marrow stem cells in vitro. The BMSC transfected with lentivirus without genes served as a blank-virus group, and saline was used for another control group. One week later, the cytokines PGE2, aggrecanase-1, hIGF-1, and IL-1 were detected and compared between groups. RESULTS:Compared with blank-virus group, the expression of COX-2 (85.81±5.12 ng/L) and aggrecanase1 (6.256±1.66) were decreased in the virus group (p<0.05), while the expression of hIGF-1 (17.46±1.86) was increased (p<0.05). The concentrations of PGE2 (85.81±5.12 ng/L), aggrecanase1 (51.34±5.463 ng/L), and IL-1 (82.31±4.321 ng/L) decreased (p<0.05) within the knee, but the concentration of hIGF-1 (44.33±0.7194 ng/L) increased (p<0.05). Compared with the other groups, the results of histological and immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated that the abrasion of articular cartilage was significantly improved and repaired. CONCLUSIONS:Lentivirus-mediated RNAi can inhibit the expression of COX-2 mRNA and aggrecanase-1mRNA, and enhance the hIGF-1 mRNA expression, thereby influencing the concentration of cytokines in the early osteoarthritic model knee joints.",0

Synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell source for meniscus regeneration due to their high proliferation and chondrogenic potential. We examined the effect of repetitive intraarticular injections of synovial MSCs on meniscus regeneration in a massive meniscal defect of pigs. We followed up the efficacy using MRI evaluation in addition to macroscopic and histological observations.Two weeks before the injection of synovial MSCs, the anterior half of the medial menisci was resected in both knees of pigs. Fifty million allogeneic synovial MSCs were injected into the right knee at 0, 2, and 4 weeks and followed up by sequential MRI. The regenerated meniscus, adjacent articular cartilage, and subchondral bone were evaluated by MRI at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. They were also evaluated macroscopically and histologically at 16 weeks (n = 7).The resected meniscus regenerated significantly better in the MSC group than in the control group based on histological and MRI analyses. Macroscopically, the meniscal defect already appeared to be filled with synovial tissue at 2 weeks. Articular cartilage and subchondral bone at the medial femoral condyle were also significantly more preserved in the MSC group based on MRI, macroscopic, and histological analyses.Intraarticular injections of allogeneic synovial MSCs appeared to promote meniscus regeneration and provide protection at the medial femoral articular cartilage in a porcine massive meniscal defect model.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.2006.12.3209,Repair of Porcine Articular Osteochondral Defects in Non-Weightbearing Areas with Autologous Bone Marrow Stromal Cells,"In vivo niche is known to play important roles in terminal differentiation of implanted bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). This study explored the feasibility of repairing articular osteochondral defects using autologous BMSCs and biodegradable polymers. BMSCs from 18 hybrid pigs’ marrows were either treated with dexamethasone (40 ng/mL) alone or chondrogenically induced with dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-β1 (10 ng/mL). The cells were seeded respectively onto polylactic acid (PLA)- coated polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds. Four osteochondral defects in each animal were created at nonweightbearing areas of knee joints (2/each side) and were respectively repaired by a chondrogenically induced BMSC-PGA/PLA construct in experimental group (Exp), by a dexamethasone-treated BMSC-PGA/PLA construct in control 1 group (Ctrl 1), by a PGA/PLA construct alone in control 2 group (Ctrl 2), or left unrepaired in control 3 group (Ctrl 3). To trace the implanted cells, green fluorescent protein (GFP)- labeled BMSCs were implanted in 2 animals. Gross view and histology showed that Exp and Ctrl 1 (with cell implantation) achieved better reparative results than Ctrl 2 and Ctrl 3 (without cell implantation) in terms of the reparative level and the restoration of the histological structure. In addition, 6-month results were better than 3-month results in all 4 groups. In Exp, 11 of 16 defects were completely repaired by hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone. In Ctrl 1, 11 of 16 defects were repaired by fibrocartilage and cancellous bone, although the repair with hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone was observed in 5 of 16 defects. In contrast, no obvious repair or only fibrotic tissue was observed in Ctrl 2 and Ctrl 3. The compressive moduli of repaired cartilage in Exp reached 80.27% of the normal amount at 6 months, with a high level of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content (no statistical difference from normal). In Ctrl 1, the compressive moduli and GAG content were 62.69% and 78.03% of normal levels, respectively. More importantly, GFP-labeled cells were detected in the engineered cartilage and the repaired subchondral bone. These results strongly indicate that the implanted BMSCs can differentiate into either chondrocytes or osteoblasts and repair articular osteochondral defects by forming engineered cartilage and engineered bone.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2014.05.014,Treatment of Glenoid Chondral Defect Using Micronized Allogeneic Cartilage Matrix Implantation,"Focal chondral lesions of the glenohumeral joint, though less common than chondral defects in the knee or ankle, can be a significant source of pain in an active population. For patients in whom nonsurgical management fails, promising results have been reported after arthroscopic microfracture surgery to treat such lesions. However, microfracture leads to growth of fibrocartilage tissue and is biomechanically less durable than native hyaline cartilage. Recently, augmentation of the microfractured defect with micronized allogeneic cartilage and platelet-rich plasma has been described to restore hyaline-like cartilage and potentially protect the subchondral bone from postsurgical fracture biology within the base of the defect. We present a simple arthroscopic technique of implanting dehydrated, micronized allogeneic cartilage scaffold to treat an isolated chondral lesion of the glenoid.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546520957346,An Injectable Hydrogel Scaffold With Kartogenin-Encapsulated Nanoparticles for Porcine Cartilage Regeneration: A 12-Month Follow-up Study,"Background: Treatment of cartilage lesions is clinically challenging. A previous study demonstrated that a hyaluronic acid hydrogel ( m-HA) with kartogenin (KGN)-loaded PLGA nanoparticles ( m-HA+KGN treatment) achieved superior cartilage repair in a rabbit model. However, large animals serve as a bridge to translate animal outcomes into the clinic. Hypotheses: (1) m-HA+KGN treatment could facilitate hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone tissue repair in a porcine model. (2) Defect size and type (full-thickness chondral vs osteochondral) influence the therapeutic efficacy of m-HA+KGN treatment. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: 48 minipigs were randomized into 3 treatment groups: m-HA hydrogel with KGN-loaded PLGA nanoparticles ( m-HA+KGN treatment), m-HA hydrogel ( m-HA treatment), and untreated (blank treatment). Full-thickness chondral (6.5 mm or 8.5 mm in diameter) or osteochondral (6.5 mm or 8.5 mm in diameter; 5-mm depth) defects were prepared in the medial femoral condyle. At 6 and 12 months postoperatively, defect repair was assessed by macroscopic appearance, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro–computed tomography (µCT), and histologic and biomechanical tests. Results: The m-HA+KGN group exhibited superior gross and histological healing after evaluation at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Improved quality of the repaired cartilage demonstrated by MRI and better subchondral bone reconstruction assessed by µCT were observed in the m-HA+KGN group. The m-HA+KGN group showed more hyaline-like cartilage exhibited by histological staining in terms of extracellular matrix, cartilage lacuna, and type II collagen. The biomechanical properties were improved in the m-HA+KGN group. With m-HA+KGN treatment, defects with a diameter of 6.5 mm or full-thickness chondral-type defects possessed significantly higher ICRS macroscopic and histological scores compared with diameter 8.5 mm or osteochondral-type defects. Conclusion: (1) m-HA+KGN treatment facilitated hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone tissue repair in a porcine model at the 12-month follow-up. (2) m-HA+KGN treatment demonstrated better therapeutic efficacy in defects with a diameter of 6.5 mm or full-thickness chondral-type defects. Clinical Relevance: This study verified the efficacy of this innovative KGN release system on cartilage repair. The KGN release system can be injected into defect sites arthroscopically. This convenient and minimally invasive operation holds important prospects for clinical application.",0
https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2412051750,Cartilage T2 Assessment: Differentiation of Normal Hyaline Cartilage and Reparative Tissue after Arthroscopic Cartilage Repair in Equine Subjects,"To prospectively assess T2 mapping characteristics of normal articular cartilage and of cartilage at sites of arthroscopic repair, including comparison with histologic results and collagen organization assessed at polarized light microscopy (PLM).Study protocol was compliant with the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guidelines and approved by the institutional animal care committee. Arthroscopic osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) and microfracture arthroplasty (MFx) were performed in knees of 10 equine subjects (seven female, three male; age range, 3-5 years). A site of arthroscopically normal cartilage was documented in each joint as a control site. Joints were harvested at 12 (n = 5) and 24 (n = 5) weeks postoperatively and were imaged at 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) with a 10-echo sagittal fast spin-echo acquisition. T2 maps of each site (21 OAT harvest, 10 MFx, 12 OAT plug, and 10 control sites) were calculated with linear least-squares curve fitting. Cartilage T2 maps were qualitatively graded as ""organized"" (normal transition of low-to-high T2 signal from deep to superficial cartilage zones) or ""disorganized."" Quantitative mean T2 values were calculated for deep, middle, and superficial cartilage at each location. Results were compared with histologic and PLM assessments by using kappa analysis.T2 maps were qualitatively graded as organized at 20 of 53 sites and as disorganized at 33 sites. Perfect agreement was seen between organized T2 and histologic findings of hyaline cartilage and between disorganized T2 and histologic findings of fibrous reparative tissue (kappa = 1.0). Strong agreement was seen between organized T2 and normal PLM findings and between disorganized T2 and abnormal PLM findings (kappa = .92). Quantitative assessment of the deep, middle, and superficial cartilage, respectively, showed mean T2 values of 53.3, 58.6, and 54.9 msec at reparative fibrous tissue sites and 40.7, 53.6, and 61.6 msec at hyaline cartilage sites. A significant trend of increasing T2 values (from deep to superficial) was found in hyaline cartilage (P < .01). Fibrous tissue sites had no significant change with depth (P > .59).Qualitative and quantitative T2 mapping helped differentiate hyaline cartilage from reparative fibrocartilage after cartilage repair at 1.5-T MR imaging.",0

Subchondral bone sclerosis, irreparable joint damage, and the early onset of osteoarthritis make the injured meniscus heal difficultly.The study was performed by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro experiments were carried out using the bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from the rabbits, and the stemness of the BMSCs was tested by immunostaining. The BMSCs positively expressed stem cell markers were cultured with various concentrations of kartogenin (KGN) for 2 weeks. The chondrogenesis of BMSCs induced by KGN was examined by histochemical staining and quantitative RT-PCR. The in vivo experiments were completed by a rabbit model. Three holes were created in each meniscus by a biopsy punch. The rabbits were treated with four different conditions in each group. Group 1 was treated with 20 μl of saline (saline); group 2 was treated with 5 μl of 100 μM KGN and 15 μl saline (KGN); group 3 was treated with 5 μl of 100 μM KGN, 5 μl of 10,000 U/ ml thrombin, and 10 μl of PRP (KGN+PRP); group 4 was treated with 10,000 BMSCs in 10 μl of PRP, 5 μl of saline solution, and 5 μl of 10,000 U/ml thrombin (PRP+BMSC); group 5 was treated with 10,000 BMSCs in 10 μl of PRP, 5 μl of 100 μM KGN, and 5 μl of 10,000 U/ml thrombin (KGN+PRP+BMSC). The menisci were collected at day 90 post-surgery for gross inspection and histochemical analysis.The histochemical staining showed that KGN induced chondrogenesis of BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. The RT-PCR results indicated that chondrocyte-related genes were also increased in the BMSCs cultured with KGN in a dose-dependent manner. The in vivo results showed that large unhealed wound areas were still found in the wounds treated with saline and KGN groups. The wounds treated with BMSCs-containing PRP gel healed much faster than the wounds treated without BMSCs. Furthermore, the wounds treated with BMSCs-containing KGN-PRP gel have healed completely and formed more cartilage-like tissues than the wounds treated with BMSCs-containing PRP gel.BMSCs could be differentiated into chondrocytes when they were cultured with KGN-PRP gel in vitro and formed more cartilage-like tissues in the wounded rabbit meniscus when the wounds were treated with BMSCs-containing KGN-PRP gel. The results indicated that the BMSCs-containing KGN-PRP gel is a good substitute for injured meniscus repair and regeneration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.08.020,A functional biphasic biomaterial homing mesenchymal stem cells for in vivo cartilage regeneration,"Cartilage regeneration after trauma is still a great challenge for clinicians and researchers due to many reasons, such as joint load-bearing, synovial movement and the paucity of endogenous repair cells. To overcome these limitations, we constructed a functional biomaterial using a biphasic scaffold platform and a bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-specific affinity peptide. The biphasic scaffold platform retains more cells homogeneously within the sol-gel transition of chitosan and provides sufficient solid matrix strength. This biphasic scaffold platform is functionalized with an affinity peptide targeting a cell source of interest, BMSCs. The presence of conjugated peptide gives this system a biological functionality towards BMSC-specific homing both in vitro and in vivo. The functional biomaterial can stimulate stem cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation during in vitro culture. Six months after in vivo implantation, compared with routine surgery or control scaffolds, the functional biomaterials induced superior cartilage repair without complications, as indicated by histological observations, magnetic resonance imaging and biomechanical properties. Beyond cartilage repair, this functional biphasic scaffold may provide a biomaterial framework for one-step tissue engineering strategy by homing endogenous cells to stimulate tissue regeneration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.073,"The dependence of autologous chondrocyte transplantation on varying cellular passage, yield and culture duration","Matrix-assisted chondrocyte transplantation (m-ACI) still lacks any standardization in its execution in terms of cell passage (P), cell yield (C) and in vitro membrane-holding time (T). It was the goal of this study to analyze the effect of shifting cell culture parameters (P, C, T) on the in vitro as well as in vivo effort of a regulated animal m-ACI. Autologous rabbit knee articular chondrocytes were seeded within bilayer collagen I/III 3-D matrices in variation of P, C and T. Each time, 2 PCT-identical by 2 PCT-identical cell-matrix-constructs (CMC)/animal were created. Simultaneously 2 (PCT-distinct) were re-implanted (CMC-e) autologous into artificial trochlear pristine chondral defects in vivo to remain for 12 weeks while the remaining 2 were harvested (CMC-i) for immediate in vitro analysis at the time of transplantation of their identical twins. mRNA of both, CMC-e regenerates and CMC-i membranes, was analyzed for Collagen-1,-2,-10, COMP, Aggrecan, Sox9 expression by use of a mixed linear model, multiple regression analysis. Generally, CMC-i values were higher than CMC-e values for differentiation targets; the opposite was true for dedifferentiation targets. Regarding individual gene expression, in vivo regenerate cell-matrix properties were significantly dependent on initial cell-matrix in vitro values as a sign of linearity. The parameter membrane-holding time (T) had strongest effects on the resulting mRNA expression with slightly less impact of the parameter passage (P), whereas cell yield (C) had clearly less effects. Noting differences between in vitro and in vivo data, in general, optimal expression patterns concerning chondrogenic differentiation were achieved by few passages, medium cellular yield, short membrane-holding time. Clinical m-ACI may benefit from optimal orchestration of the cell culture parameters passage, yield and time.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2015.05.017,Mesenchymal stromal cells and rheumatic disorders,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), often incorrectly called stem cells, have been the intense focus of in vitro studies and animal models of rheumatic and other diseases over more than a decade. Despite multiple plausible mechanisms of action and a plethora of positive in vivo animal studies, few randomised controlled clinical trials have demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit in any condition so far. This could be due to confusion in cell product terminology, complexity of clinical study design and execution or agreement on meaningful outcome measures. It could also indicate that MSC as currently employed are ineffective. Within the rheumatic diseases, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) have received most attention. Uncontrolled multiple trial data from over 300 SLE patients have been published from one centre suggesting a positive outcome; one single centre comparative study in 172 RA was positive and no human studies have compared intra-articular MSC therapy to non-MSC techniques for osteoarthritis in the absence of surgery. Two randomised studies suggested benefit from the addition of bone marrow derived MSC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells added to surgical ""standard of care"" in knee OA and knee focal cartilage defects, respectively. The possible reasons for this apparent mismatch between expectation and clinical reality will be discussed.",0

However, the effect of harvesting grafts on knee function remains unclear.To clarify the functional effects on the donor knee of harvesting osteochondral grafts and to perform magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of donor site repair after mosaicplasty for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans in young athletes.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Eleven male competitive athletes with advanced lesions of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans underwent mosaicplasties. The surgical technique involves obtaining small-sized cylindrical osteochondral grafts from the lateral periphery of the femoral condyle at the level of the patellofemoral joint and transplanting them to osteochondral defects in the capitellum. Assessment at a mean follow-up of 26 months included local findings of the donor knees, a Lysholm knee scoring scale, International Knee Documentation Committee standard evaluation form, and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation.All patients returned to a competitive level of their previous sports without any donor site disturbances. Based on the Lysholm knee score and International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form, all knees were graded as excellent and normal, respectively. The magnetic resonance imaging showed 50% to 100% defect fill in 6 of 9 patients and normal or nearly normal signals in 4 patients at the donor sites.No adverse effects of osteochondral graft harvest on donor knee function were found after mosaicplasty for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans in young athletes. However, magnetic resonance imaging indicates that the donor site is resurfaced with fibrous tissue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2006.09.005,Repair of Full-Thickness Cartilage Defects With Cells of Different Origin in a Rabbit Model,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the repaired tissues formed in full-thickness cartilage defects in a rabbit model implanted with 4 types of chondrogenic cells, including chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts from rabbit, and human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stem cells.Chondrocytes, MSCs, and fibroblasts were isolated from 6-week-old New Zealand rabbits; hUCB stem cells were isolated from the umbilical cord blood of newborn children. These 4 types of cells were cultured in vitro and embedded in polylactic acid (PLA) matrices. Full-thickness defects were produced in the femoral trochlear grooves of both knees in 36 adult New Zealand White rabbits. Cell/PLA composites were transplanted into cartilage defects. A total of 5 groups were formed according to implanted cell type: Group A, chondrocytes; Group B, MSCs; Group C, fibroblasts; Group D, hUCB stem cells; and Group E, no cells (control group). Repaired tissues were evaluated grossly, histologically, and immunohistochemically at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after implantation.In Groups A and B, defects were repaired with hyaline-like cartilage. In Group C, defects were repaired with fibrous tissue. In Group D, defects were repaired primarily with fibrous tissue and scattered chondrocytes; in some specimens, defects were repaired with a thin layer of hyaline-like cartilage at 12 weeks. In Group E, defects were repaired with fibrous tissue. Histologic scores in Groups A and B were significantly higher than those in Groups C, D, and E at 6 and 12 weeks after transplantation.Full-thickness cartilage defects treated with chondrocyte or MSC transplantation were repaired with hyaline-like cartilage tissue, and repair was significantly better than in tissues treated with fibroblasts and hUCB stem cells, as well as in the control group. Repaired tissues treated with MSCs appeared to have better cell arrangement, subchondral bone remodeling, and integration with surrounding cartilage than did repaired tissues generated by chondrocyte implantation. MSCs might be the most suitable cell source for cartilage repair. Further investigation into hUCB stem cell transplantation is needed.In our study of rabbits, MSCs supplied the most promising cell source for cartilage repair.",0

Age \textbackslashtextless40 years, epiphyseal closure, cartilage defect grade 3/4 (International Cartilage Repair Society). Contraindications Cartilage defects at medial or lateral femorotibial compartments, at the trochlea, with degenerative genesis, rheumatoid arthritis, local infection, patellar malalignment, patellofemoral dysplasia, knee instability, knee malalignment \textbackslashtextgreater3 degrees, kissing lesions. Surgical technique Two-stage procedure: At initial arthroscopy, chondrocytes were harvested. At the second stage, the patient was positioned prone and the leg with a thigh tourniquet was fixed in a leg holder. Removal of table extension below the knee and support of foot in sling to prevent knee hyperextension. Placement of 2 lateral portals. Lesion visualized and debrided, followed by aspiration of intra-articular fluid. A loop, placed posterior to the patellar ligament using a lasso, was used to suspend a weight to expand the patellofemoral space. The lesion was then dried using a sponge. NOVOCART (R) Inject (TETEC, Reutlingen, Germany) administered onto the defect. Gel was allowed to solidify for 15 min and operation was completed. Postoperative management Knee locked in extension using a brace for 6 weeks. Continuous passive motion applied and incrementally increased until full range of motion (ROM) at week 6. Weight-bearing as tolerated was allowed with the knee in extension. Routine clinical follow-up after 3, 6 and 12 months.

Clinical examination at the latest follow-up revealed a Kujala score of 90 +/- 12 points and Lysholm score of 95 +/- 5 points. MRI showed filled cartilage defects in all patients. Mocart score was 63 +/- 7 points. Cartilage was inhomogeneous and hyperintense at the repaired site. Quantitative measurement of the patella mobility of the operated knee under a translating force of 10 N showed medial and lateral displacements of 21 +/- 5 and 15 +/- 2 mm and on the healthy side 22 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 3 mm, respectively.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2021.07.010,The “BioHumi” Humeral Head Elliptical Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Cartilage defects of the humeral head in young, active patients provide a challenge to treating surgeons. The causes of humeral head osteochondral lesions are variable, but these lesions most commonly result from trauma and recurrent glenohumeral instability. Palliative and reparative techniques such as arthroscopic debridement and microfracture have traditionally been used as surgical treatment but have high failure rates. Similarly to surgical trends in the knee, cartilage restoration in the shoulder is becoming more prevalent in younger patients. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OAT) has been used as a joint-preserving surgical option to restore hyaline cartilage in multiple joints for decades. Although OAT is more commonly used to re-establish the subchondral bony architecture in the treatment of recurrent shoulder instability, the procedure may also be indicated in young, active patients with focal humeral head chondral defects. OAT has been shown in early studies to provide improvement in functional outcome scores and good long-term graft survival with relatively low rates of complications. This report describes our straightforward, reproducible technique for the treatment of large, oblong chondral defects of the humeral head using OAT.",0

Treatment of symptomatic chondral defects is challenging due to the limited healing capacity of articular cartilage. Microfracture is the most common surgical technique used to treat chondral defects in the knee and utilizes marrow stimulation to generate a fibrocartilage repair. Microfracture has demonstrated good short-term postoperative outcomes. Long-term outcomes following microfracture are variable, with loss of improvement attributed to the poor mechanical qualities of the fibrous repair tissue. Current research is focusing on ways to optimize the repair environment after microfracture using biological scaffolds (enhanced microfracture) to facilitate chondrogenic differentiation and proliferation to improve the quality of repair tissue.",0

Indications Localized partial or full-thickness cartilage defects in the knee or osteochondral lesions (osteochondritis dissecans (OD]). Contraindications Generalized cartilage defects, osteoarthritis, bacterial and rheumatoid arthritis, uncorrected axis deformities, ligament instability, patella instability, meniscectomy. Surgical Technique Two-step procedure. 1. Diagnostic arthroscopy and cartilage biopsy for cell cultivation. 2. Minimalized arthrotomy. Defect debridement. Autologous cancellous bone grafting in OD. Glueing of the cell-loaded scaffold into the defect. Postoperative Management Early functional rehabilitation with knee orthosis. Partial weight bearing (20 kg) for 6 weeks. Results 50 patients (24 female, 26 male, age 14-44years, mean 30.3 years) with 58 focal cartilage defects (III-IV degrees) of the knee in the medial (n = 32) or lateral condyle (n = 5), patella (n = 14) and/or trochlea (n = 7) underwent matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI (R)). The mean follow-up was 24 months (21-29 months). The mean defect size was 4.1 cm(2) (1.6-6.1 cm(2)).

Two authors reviewed the articles, the study exclusion criteria were applied, and articles were determined to be relevant (or not) to the research question. All studies with a minimum of 2 years' clinical follow-up were reviewed for all reported reoperations. The reasons for reoperations were recorded.We reviewed 66 articles from the 301 articles identified in the original systematic search. There were 60 articles on matrix-assisted cartilage transplantation and 6 articles on matrix-induced chondrogenesis. The matrix-assisted cartilage transplantation studies reported on a total of 1,380 patients at 2 to 5 years' follow-up. Among these, there were 72 reoperations (5%) including 46 treatment failures (3%). These numbers increased to an 11% reoperation rate and 9% treatment failure rate at minimum 5-year follow-up of 961 patients. The most common procedures performed other than revision cartilage surgery or arthroplasty were manipulation under anesthesia for arthrofibrosis (0.7%) and debridement for graft hypertrophy (1.2%). The matrix-induced chondrogenesis studies reported on 163 patients. Among these, there were 15 reoperations (9%) that included 4 treatment failures (2%), 9 manipulations under anesthesia (6%), and 2 debridements for graft hypertrophy (1%).Treatment failure rates for matrix-assisted cartilage repair increase from short-term to midterm follow-up, with 11% of patients having undergone further surgery at a minimum of 5 years' follow-up. These data can be used to counsel patients on the potential need for further operative intervention after this emerging cartilage repair technique.",0

The operative management of these focal chondral lesions continues to be a regenerative challenge. The microfracture (MFx) procedure has become a first-line arthroscopic treatment method for small, symptomatic chondral lesions, and it frequently serves as the standard technique against which other cartilage repair procedures are compared. Over time, outcome studies have defined the weaknesses and limitations of first-generation MFx. The second iteration of MFx seeks to optimize regeneration using the trilogy of cells, scaffolds, and growth factors. As surgeons, we are only as strong as our weakest link.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/art.23124,Cell-based resurfacing of large cartilage defects: Long-term evaluation of grafts from autologous transgene-activated periosteal cells in a porcine model of osteoarthritis,"To investigate the potential of transgene-activated periosteal cells for permanently resurfacing large partial-thickness cartilage defects.In miniature pigs, autologous periosteal cells stimulated ex vivo by bone morphogenetic protein 2 gene transfer, using liposomes or a combination of adeno-associated virus (AAV) and adenovirus (Ad) vectors, were applied on a bioresorbable scaffold to chondral lesions comprising the entire medial half of the patella. The resulting repair tissue was assessed, 6 and 26 weeks after transplantation, by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. The biomechanical properties of the repair tissue were characterized by nanoindentation measurements. Implants of unstimulated cells and untreated lesions served as controls.All grafts showed satisfactory integration into the preexisting cartilage. Six weeks after transplantation, AAV/Ad-stimulated periosteal cells had adopted a chondrocyte-like phenotype in all layers; the newly formed matrix was rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, and its contact stiffness was close to that of healthy hyaline cartilage. Unstimulated periosteal cells and cells activated by liposomal gene transfer formed only fibrocartilaginous repair tissue with minor contact stiffness. However, within 6 months following transplantation, the AAV/Ad-stimulated cells in the superficial zone tended to dedifferentiate, as indicated by a switch from type II to type I collagen synthesis and reduced contact stiffness. In deeper zones, these cells retained their chondrocytic phenotype, coinciding with positive staining for type II collagen in the matrix.Large partial-thickness cartilage defects can be resurfaced efficiently with hyaline-like cartilage formed by transgene-activated periosteal cells. The long-term stability of the cartilage seems to depend on physicobiochemical factors that are active only in deeper zones of the cartilaginous tissue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-012-2031-5,Microfracture combined with osteochondral paste implantation was more effective than microfracture alone for full-thickness cartilage repair,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the microfracture combined with osteochondral paste implantation could promote the quality of the regenerated tissue in the knee joints of rabbits. METHODS: Sixty-six New Zealand white rabbits were used. Bilateral knee joints from the same rabbit were randomly divided into experimental group and microfracture group. An articular cartilage defect was established in the femoral trochlear groove. In the experimental group, the defect was microfractured and covered with osteochondral paste harvested from the intercondylar notch. The regenerated tissues were harvested for gross morphology, histology, biochemistry and gene expression analysis at 4, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: The regenerated tissue had a slowly mature process in both groups. At 12 weeks, the regenerated tissue in the experimental group appeared much more thicker and white with higher percentages of defect filling macroscopically. In histology, the experimental group found a majority of hyaline-like regenerate tissue with intense Safranin-O and collagen type II staining, while fibrocartilage-like tissue was mostly seen in the microfracture group with poor Safranin-O and collagen type II staining. The experimental group had higher Wakitani scores and narrower acellular zones than those in the microfracture group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). For biochemical analysis, both the GAG content and the DNA-normalized GAG content saw a time-dependent increase with a much higher value found in the experimental group at 8 and 12 weeks (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). On the contrary, the total DNA content decreased with time in both groups, and the difference between the two groups was only found at 4 and 8 weeks (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). For gene expression analysis, the experimental group had much higher expression levels than the microfracture group as for collagen type II and aggrecan, but not for collagen type I. CONCLUSION: Microfracture combined with paste implantation can result in improved quality of the reparative tissue and may have a positive effect on the integration to the surrounding cartilage in the rabbit model. The technique offers a promising treatment option for cartilage defects and improves the regeneration of articular cartilage for patients with painful chondral lesions.",1

Group A (n = 73) comprised patients who did not undergo reoperation, group B (n = 61) comprised patients who underwent reoperation and had findings unrelated to the repair, and group C (n = 36) comprised patients who underwent reoperation and had isolated graft hypertrophy. The International Knee Documentation Committee, modified Cincinnati knee rating, and Short Form 36 physical component scores for the 3 groups were compared. Of the repairs debrided because of graft hypertrophy, 41 were longitudinally assessed with arthroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging.The mean follow-up was 42.2 months. Patch-related problems were seen in 73.7% of cases undergoing reoperation less than 2 years after implantation, whereas cartilage-related problems were the dominant finding more than 2 years after implantation (70.2%). Group A patients fared significantly better than group B or C patients with regard to all 3 parameters measured, with no difference between groups B and C. Longitudinal assessment of 41 hypertrophied repairs revealed 18 with signs of pathology after graft debridement.This study shows that reoperation is frequent after ACI and is associated with a less satisfying outcome. Furthermore, debridement of a hypertrophied ACI graft appears to be detrimental as shown by longitudinal assessment of repairs.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0

Methods Eight human cadaveric limbs were strapped to a continuous passive motion device and exposed to extension-flexion cycles (0 degrees-90 degrees). Chondral lesions (1.8 cm diameter) were prepared on condyles, patella and trochlea for the implant of a bi-layer collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold. The first set-up compared four fixation techniques: press-fit (PF) vs. fibrin glue (FG) vs. pins vs. sutures; the second compared circular and square implants; the third investigated stability in a weight-bearing simulation. The scaffolds were evaluated using semi-quantitative Drobnic and modified Bekkers scores. Results FG presented higher total Drobnic and Bekkers scores compared to PF (both p = 0.002), pins (p = 0.013 and 0.001) and sutures (p = 0.001 and \textbackslashtextless 0.0005). Pins offered better total Drobnic and Bekkers scores than PF in the anterior femoral condyles (p = 0.007 and 0.065), similar to FG. The comparison of round and square implants applied by FG showed worst results for square lesions (Drobnic score p = 0.049, Bekkers score p = 0.037). Finally, load caused worst overall results (Drobnic p = 0.018). Conclusions FG improves the fixation of this collagen-HA scaffold regardless of lesion location, improving implant stability while preserving its integrity. Pins represent a suitable option only for lesions of the anterior condyles. Square scaffolds present weak corners, therefore, round implants should be preferred. Finally, partial weight-bearing simulation significantly affected the scaffold. These findings may be useful to improve surgical technique and post-operative management of patients, to optimize the outcome of chondral scaffold implantation.",0

Human osteoarthritic chondrocytes were harvest from nine different patients (mean +/- A SD age 68 +/- A 8 years) who underwent total knee replacement. The chondrocytes were embedded after a precultivation phase into a collagen I hydrogel. Mid-term intermitted mechanostimulation on matrix-embedded dedifferentiated human osteoarthritic chondrocytes was performed by intermittently applying a cyclic sinusoid compression regime for 4 days (cycles of 1 h of sinusoidal stimulation (1 Hz) and 4 h of break; maximum compression 2.5 %). Stimulated (Flex) and non-stimulated (No Flex) cell matrix constructs were analysed concerning the expression of genes involved in tissue metabolism, the content of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and the morphology of the chondrocytes. Gene expression analysis showed a high significant increase in collagen type II expression (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001), a significant increase in aggrecan expression (p \textbackslashtextless 0.04) and a high significant decrease in MMP-13 expression (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001) under stimulation condition compared with unstimulated controls. No significant changes were found in the gene expression rate of MMP-3. This positive effect of the mechanostimulation was confirmed by the analyses of sGAG. Mechanically stimulated cell-matrix constructs had nearly tripled sGAG content than the non-stimulated control (p \textbackslashtextless 0.002). In addition, histological examination showed that morphology of chondrocytes was altered from a spindle-shaped to a chondrocyte-characteristic rounded phenotype. Mid-term intermitted mechanical stimulation in vitro has the potential to improve the cell quality of cell matrix constructs prepared from dedifferentiated osteoarthritic chondrocytes. This observation may extend the inclusion criteria for matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) and confirms the importance of moderate dynamic compression in clinical rehabilitation after MACI.",0

A pilot study,"Different single-stage surgical approaches are currently under evaluation to repair cartilage focal lesions. To date, only little is known on even short-term clinical follow-up and almost no knowledge exists on histological results of such treatments. The present paper aims to analyze the clinical and histological results of the collagen-covered microfracture and bone marrow concentrate (C-CMBMC) technique in the treatment of focal condylar lesions of knee articular cartilage.Nine patients with focal lesions of the condylar articular cartilage were consecutively treated with arthroscopic microfractures (MFX) covered with a collagen membrane immersed in autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMC) from the iliac crest. Patients were retrospectively assessed using several standardized outcome assessment tools and MRI scans. Four patients consented to undergo second look arthroscopy and biopsy harvest.Every patient was arthroscopically treated for a focal condylar lesion (mean area 2.5 SD(0.4) cm(2)). All the patients (mean age 43 SD(9) years) but one experienced a significant clinical improvement from the pre-operative condition to the latest follow-up (mean 29 SD(11) months). Cartilage macroscopic assessment at 12 months revealed that all the repairs appeared almost normal. Histological analysis showed a hyaline-like cartilage repair in one lesion, a fibrocartilaginous repair in two lesions and a mixture of both in one lesion.The first clinical experience with single-stage C-CMBMC for focal cartilage defects in the knee suggests that it is safe, it improves the short-term knee function and that it has the potential to recreate hyaline-like cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/term.2173,Repair of large osteochondritis dissecans lesions using a novel multilayered tissue engineered construct in an equine athlete,"Osteochondral lesions resulting from osteochondritis dissecans are problematic to treat and present a significant challenge for clinicians. The aims of this study were to investigate the use of a scaffold-assisted microfracture approach, employing a novel, multilayered, collagen-based, osteochondral graft substitute in the treatment of severe osteochondritis dissecans of both lateral femoral trochlear ridges in an equine athlete, and to assess the potential of this novel scaffold to enhance repair of the osteochondral unit. A 15 month-old female filly presented with large osteochondritis dissecans lesions involving both femoral lateral trochlear ridges. After routine arthroscopic debridement and microfracture of the subchondral bone, multilayered osteochondral defect repair scaffolds were implanted into the fragmentation beds in both left and right femoropatellar joints via mini-arthrotomies. Exploratory arthroscopy 5 months postimplantation revealed smooth cartilaginous repair tissue, contiguous with the adjacent cartilage, covering the defect. At 22-month follow up, the filly had no signs of lameness and was exercising at her intended level. Radiographically, although still slightly flattened, the femoral trochlear ridges were smooth, with no evidence of osteoarthritis. Ultrasonographically, the defects were filled with bone and covered with an overlying cartilaginous layer, with the trochlear ridge contour almost entirely restored. This report demonstrates the effective clinical use of this novel, multilayered, osteochondral defect repair scaffold in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of an equine athlete. The successful repair achieved here using this novel scaffold in an equine patient with large bilateral lesions shows the potential for clinical translation in the treatment of human patients presenting with osteochondral defects.

Purpose: To characterize the survivorship, predictors of failure, and clinical outcomes of osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) of the knee among patients aged ≥40 years. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Prospectively collected data were reviewed for 54 consecutive patients aged ≥40 years who were treated with OCA. Preoperative levels of osteoarthritis (according to Kellgren-Lawrence classification) and meniscal volume and quality were graded from review of radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Complications, reoperations, and patient responses to validated outcome measures were reviewed. A minimum follow-up of 2 years was required for analysis. Failure was defined by any removal or revision of the allograft or conversion to arthroplasty. Results: Among 51 patients (mean age, 48 years; range, 40-63 years; 65% male), a total of 52 knees had symptomatic focal cartilage lesions (up to 2 affected areas) that were classified as Outerbridge grade 4 at the time of OCA and did not involve substantial bone loss requiring shell allografts or additional bone grafting. Mean duration of follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 2-11 years). After OCA, 21 knees (40%) underwent reoperation, including 14 failures (27%) consisting of revision OCA (n = 1), unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (n = 5), and total knee arthroplasty (n = 8). Mean time to failure was 33 months, and 2- and 4-year survivorship rates were 88% and 73%, respectively. Male sex (hazard ratio = 4.18, 95% CI = 1.12-27.13) and a higher number of previous ipsilateral knee operations (hazard ratio = 1.70 per increase in 1 surgical procedure, 95% CI = 1.03-2.83) were predictors of failure. A higher Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis grade on preoperative radiographs was associated with higher failure rates in the Kaplan-Meier analysis but not the multivariate model. At final follow-up, clinically significant improvements were noted in the pain (mean score, 47.8 to 67.6) and physical functioning (56.8 to 79.1) subscales of the Short Form-36, as well as the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective form (45.0 to 63.6), Knee Outcome Survey–Activities of Daily Living (64.5 to 80.1), and overall condition statement (4.5 to 6.8) ( P &lt; .001). No significant changes were noted for the Marx Activity Rating Scale (5.1 to 3.9, P = .789). Conclusion: A higher failure rate was found in this series of patients aged ≥40 years who were treated with OCA as compared with other studies of younger populations. However, for select older patients, OCA can be a good midterm treatment option for cartilage defects of the knee.",0
,[Aseptic necrosis of the capitulum of the humerus (Panner's disease) treated by solid chondrograft implantation].,"The authors present the case of aseptic necrosis of the humeral capitulum in a top female gymnast. She was referred to our department with the diagnosis of aseptic necrosis already made and after repeated arthroscopic treatment of the elbow including removal of a loose body in another institution. Exercise-related pain and swelling of the elbow became permanent and did not allow her to pursue her sports activities. After thorough examination, the treatment by implantation of autologous cultured chondrocytes, as a solid chondrograft, was chosen. At the first stage of arthroscopic surgery, a loose body was removed and a sample of healthy cartilage from an articular region not subject to strain was collected. The sample was sent to the Tissue Bank for cultivation and chondrocyte formation into a solid chondrograft, a procedure taking 4 to 5 weeks. At the second stage, the chondrograft was implanted into the lesion site and fixed with tissue glue (Tissucol). The arm was immobilised in a plaster cast for 4 weeks. The patient was followed up clinically and examined with magnetic resonance imaging at 6 month after implantation. The examination showed full graft integration and the arm's return to full mobility without pain at exercise. Even with this rare lesion site within the elbow joint, the implantation of a solid chondrograft proved to be a method achieving very good outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.4081/or.2013.e36,Reconstruction of osteochondral defects by combined bone grafting and a bilayer collagen membrane as a sandwich technique,"Treatment of osteochondral lesions of the knee remains a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. Recently established procedures like autologous chondrocyte implantation or matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation yield good results, but include the disadvantage of two-step procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcome of repairs of osteochondral defects of the knee by a combined procedure of bone grafting and covering with a bilayer collagen membrane in a sandwich technique. Seven male patients with a mean age of 42 (range 30-55) years and symptomatic focal osteochondral lesions of the knee grade IV according to the International Cartilage Repair Society classification were included. The mean diameter of defects was 28.6 (range 15-40) mm. Results were evaluated at a minimum of 24 months after surgery by International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm-score, visual analogue scale, and magnetic resonance imaging with specific cartilage sequences, evaluating the ICRS score and the Magnetic Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score. All patients judged the operation as successful. Among the patients available for the long-term follow-up, mean visual analogue scale value was 1.3 (range 0-3) out of 10 points. Mean International Knee Documentation Committee score was 80.8 (range 63.2-88.5) out of 100 points. Mean Lysholm score was 85 (range 55-95) out of 100 points. None of the patients had to be reoperated until today. Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging using the MOCART score revealed a good correlation to the clinical outcome. This is the first study reporting results after reconstruction of osteochondral defects of the knee joint by bone grafting and a bilayer collagen membrane. This new method offers the advantage of a one-step-procedure and yields both good clinical and magnetic resonance findings. We conclude that this procedure can be a valuable tool to improve joint function after osteochondral defects, trauma, and in joints with local arthritic lesions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.33225,Osteochondral interface regeneration of the rabbit knee with macroscopic gradients of bioactive signals,"To date, most interfacial tissue engineering approaches have used stratified designs, in which there are two or more discrete layers comprising the interface. Continuously graded interfacial designs, where there is no discrete transition from one tissue type to another, are gaining attention as an alternative to stratified designs. Given that osteochondral regeneration holds the potential to enhance cartilage regeneration by leveraging the healing capacity of the underlying bone, we endeavored to introduce a continuously-graded approach to osteochondral regeneration. The purpose of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of a novel gradient-based scaffolding approach to regenerate osteochondral defects in the New Zealand White rabbit femoral condyle. Bioactive plugs were constructed from poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres with a continuous gradient transition between cartilage-promoting and bone-promoting growth factors. At 6 and 12 weeks of healing, results suggested that the implants provided support for the neo-synthesized tissue, and the gradient in bioactive signaling may have been beneficial for bone and cartilage regeneration compared to the blank control implant, as evidenced by histology. In addition, the effects of preseeding gradient scaffolds with umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) from the Wharton's jelly of New Zealand White rabbits were evaluated. Results indicated that there may be regenerative benefits to prelocalizing UCMSCs within scaffold interiors. The inclusion of bioactive factors in a gradient-based scaffolding design is a promising new treatment strategy for defect repair in the femoral condyle. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546513485931,Correlation Between Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Outcomes After Cartilage Repair Surgery in the Knee,"Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to assess cartilage after surgical repair. The correlation between MRI and clinical outcomes is not well understood. Hypothesis: Postoperative MRI findings correlate with clinical outcome measures in patients after articular cartilage surgery of the knee. Study Design: Meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies in which MRI and clinical outcomes were correlated after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS), or microfracture. Studies that reported correlation coefficients ( r) for different MRI parameters were then included in a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 26 studies were identified for inclusion in this systematic review, 15 of which were included in the meta-analysis. Most of the studies (n = 19) involved ACI, although studies were available for OATS (n = 5) and microfracture (n = 4). The strongest MRI correlates with clinical outcomes after ACI were graft hypertrophy ( r = 0.72) and repair tissue signal ( r = 0.71). After microfracture, the strongest MRI correlates were the Henderson score ( r = 0.97), subchondral edema ( r = 0.77), and repair tissue signal ( r = 0.76). Correlations after OATS were not as strong, with defect fill ( r = 0.53) and repair tissue structure ( r = 0.51) being the strongest. Conclusion: The MRI findings do correlate with clinical outcomes after cartilage repair surgery in the knee, although the specific parameters that correlate best vary by the type of procedure performed. No current MRI classification system has been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes after all types of cartilage repair surgery.",0

The cartilage repair site was assessed at 6 weeks and 6 months after implantation by histology, immunohistochemistry, and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation.NC-based grafts, independently of their composition, induced partial hyaline cartilage repair with stable integrity in surrounding healthy tissue at 6 months after treatment. The SCA repaired cartilage to a similar degree to that of NC-based grafts.Kissing lesion repair, as evidenced in this sheep study, demonstrated the feasibility of the treatment of complex cartilage injuries with advanced biological methods. However, the potential advantages of an NC-based approach over a cell-free approach warrant further investigations in a more relevant preclinical model.NC-based grafts currently undergoing phase II clinical trials have a high potential to replace existing cartilage therapies that show significant limitations in the quality and reproducibility of the repair method. We have brought this innovative concept to the next level by addressing a new clinical indication.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2013.05.014,Treatment of Large Cystic Medial Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus With Autologous Osteoperiosteal Cylinder Grafts,"To investigate the clinical, radiologic, and second-look arthroscopic outcomes of autologous iliac crest osteoperiosteal cylinder graft transplantation for medial osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) with large subchondral cysts.Between January 2008 and December 2010, 17 consecutive cases of medial OLT with a subchondral cyst larger than 10 mm in diameter received transplantation of autologous osteoperiosteal cylinder graft, which was harvested from the ipsilateral iliac crest. The visual analog scale score for pain during daily activities, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot and ankle scores, and subjective satisfaction survey rating were obtained. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the ankle were obtained before and after surgery. In 13 cases second-look arthroscopy was performed 12 months postoperatively and the cartilage repair was assessed with the criteria of the International Cartilage Repair Society.Sixteen patients were available for follow-up at a mean of 32.6 months (range, 24 to 48 months). The mean visual analog scale score decreased from 5.51 ± 0.83 preoperatively to 0.98 ± 0.98 at the latest follow-up, and the median American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score improved from 75 preoperatively to 90 at the latest follow-up. Seven patients resumed sporting activities. Overall, 7 patients rated the result as excellent, 8 as good, and 1 as fair. The radiolucent area of the cysts disappeared on the plain radiographs in all cases. The mean Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score was 60 ± 9.4 points, whereas subchondral bone edema persisted on the postoperative magnetic resonance images in 16 cases. The mean International Cartilage Repair Society arthroscopic score for cartilage repair at second-look arthroscopy was 9 ± 1.4 points.Autologous iliac crest osteoperiosteal cylinder graft transplantation with supplemental bone grafting is a simple, safe, and effective procedure for treatment of large cystic medial OLT. It can successfully fill the subchondral cyst and repair the cartilage defect.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0

This study evaluates an alternative, using surgical angiogenesis from implanted autogenous vessels to maintain viability without long-term immunotherapy.Vascularized knee joints were transplanted from Dutch Belted donors to New Zealand White rabbit recipients. Once positioned and revascularized microsurgically, a recipient-derived superficial inferior epigastric fascial flap and a saphenous arteriovenous bundle were placed within the transplanted femur and tibia, respectively, to develop a neoangiogenic, autogenous circulation. There were 10 transplants in group 1. Group 2 (n = 9) consisted of no-angiogenesis controls with ligated flaps and arteriovenous bundles. Group 3 rabbits (n = 10) were autotransplants with patent implants. Tacrolimus was used for 3 weeks to maintain nutrient flow during angiogenesis. At 16 weeks, the authors assessed bone healing, joint function, bone and cartilage mechanical properties, and histology.Group 1 allotransplants had more robust angiogenesis, better healing, improved mechanical properties, and better osteocyte viability than ligated controls (group 2). All three groups developed knee joint contractures and arthritic changes. Cartilage thickness and quality were poorer in allograft groups than in autotransplant controls.Surgical angiogenesis from implanted autogenous tissue improves bone viability, healing, and material properties in rabbit allogenic knee transplants. However, joint contractures and degenerative changes occurred in all transplants, regardless of antigenicity or blood supply. Experimental studies in a larger animal model with improved methods to maintain joint mobility are needed before the merit of living joint allotransplantation can be judged.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2015.02.018,Editorial Commentary: Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation Versus Microfracture,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) shows greater durability, lower failure rates, and is effective for larger lesions, compared with microfracture. In addition, membrane-ACI (M-ACI) is technically simpler with fewer complications of cartilage hypertrophy than first-generation ACI using periosteum. However, second-generation, M-ACI is not yet approved for general use in the United States.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0711,Hyaluronic Acid-Binding Scaffold for Articular Cartilage Repair,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an extracellular matrix molecule with multiple physical and biological functions found in many tissues, including cartilage. HA has been incorporated in a number of biomaterial and scaffold systems. However, HA in the material may be difficult to control if it is not chemically modified and chemical modification of HA may negatively impact biological function. In this study, we developed a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel with noncovalent HA-binding capabilities and evaluated its ability to support cartilage formation in vitro and in an articular defect model. Chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in the HA-interactive scaffolds containing various amounts of exogenous HA was evaluated. The HA-binding hydrogel without exogenous HA produced the best cartilage as determined by biochemical content (glysocaminoglycan and collagen), histology (Safranin O and type II collagen staining), and gene expression analysis for aggrecan, type I collagen, type II collagen, and sox-9. This HA-binding formulation was then translated to an osteochondral defect model in the rat knee. After 6 weeks, histological analysis demonstrated improved cartilage tissue production in defects treated with the HA-interactive hydrogel compared to noninteractive control scaffolds and untreated defects. In addition to the tissue repair in the defect space, the Safranin O staining in cartilage tissue surrounding the defect was greater in treatment groups where the HA-binding scaffold was applied. In sum, incorporation of a noncovalent HA-binding functionality into biomaterials provides an ability to interact with local or exogenous HA, which can then impact tissue remodeling and ultimately new tissue production.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.595932,A Novel Strategy to Enhance Microfracture Treatment With Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1 in a Rat Model,"Microfracture is one of the most widely used techniques for the repair of articular cartilage. However, microfracture often results in filling of the chondral defect with fibrocartilage, which exhibits poor durability and sub-optimal mechanical properties. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a potent chemoattractant for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and is expressed at high levels in bone marrow adjacent to developing cartilage during endochondral bone formation. Integrating SDF-1 into an implantable collagen scaffold may provide a chondro-conductive and chondro-inductive milieu via chemotaxis of MSCs and promotion of chondrogenic differentiation, facilitating more robust hyaline cartilage formation following microfracture.This work aimed to confirm the chemoattractive properties of SDF-1 in vitro and develop a one-step method for incorporating SDF-1 in vivo to enhance cartilage repair using a rat osteochondral defect model.Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) were harvested from the femurs of Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, with the medium changed every 3 days. Passage 1 MSCs were analyzed by flow cytometry with an S3 Cell Sorter (Bio-Rad). In vitro cell migration assays were performed on MSCs by labeling cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE; Bio-Rad). For the microfracture model, a 1.6-mm-diameter osteochondral defect was created in the femoral trochleae of 20 Sprague-Dawley rats bilaterally until bone marrow spillage was seen under saline irrigation. One knee was chosen at random to receive implantation of the scaffold, and the contralateral knee was left unfilled as an empty control. Type I collagen scaffolds (Kensey Nash) were coated with either gelatin only or gelatin and SDF-1 using a dip coating process. The rats received implantation of either a gelatin-only scaffold (N = 10) or gelatin-and-SDF-1 scaffold (N = 10) at the site of the microfracture. Femurs were collected for histological analyses at 4- and 8-week time points post-operatively, and sections were stained with Safranin O/Fast Green. The samples were graded blindly by two observers using the Modified O'Driscoll score, a validated scoring system for chondral repair. A minimum of 10 separate grading scores were made per sample and averaged. Quantitative comparisons of cell migration in vitro were performed with one-way ANOVA. Cartilage repair in vivo was also compared among groups with one-way ANOVA, and the results were presented as mean ± standard deviation, with P-values < 0.05 considered as statistically significant.MSC migration showed a dose-response relationship with SDF-1, with an optimal dosage for chemotaxis between 10 and 100 ng/ml. After scaffold implantation, the SDF-1-treated group demonstrated complete filling of the cartilage defect with mature cartilage tissue, exhibiting strong proteoglycan content, smooth borders, and good incorporation into marginal cartilage. Modified O'Driscoll scores after 8 weeks showed a significant improvement of cartilage repair in the SDF-1 group relative to the empty control group (P < 0.01), with a trend toward improvement when compared with the gelatin-only-scaffold group (P < 0.1). No significant differences in scores were found between the empty defect group and gelatin-only group.In this study, we demonstrated a simple method for improving the quality of cartilage defect repair in a rat model of microfracture. We confirmed the chemotactic properties of SDF-1 on rat MSCs and found an optimized dosage range for chemotaxis between 10 and 100 ng/ml. Furthermore, we demonstrated a strategy to incorporate SDF-1 into gelatin-collagen I scaffolds in vivo at the site of an osteochondral defect. SDF-1-treated defects displayed robust hyaline cartilage resurfacing of the defect with minimal fibrous tissue, in contrast to the empty control group. The results of the in vitro and in vivo studies together suggest that SDF-1-mediated signaling may significantly improve the quality of cartilage regeneration in an osteochondral defect.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.21114,Injectable gellan gum hydrogels with autologous cells for the treatment of rabbit articular cartilage defects,"In this work, the ability of gellan gum hydrogels coupled with autologous cells to regenerate rabbit full-thickness articular cartilage defects was tested. Five study groups were defined: (a) gellan gum with encapsulated chondrogenic predifferentiated rabbit adipose stem cells (ASC + GF); (b) gellan gum with encapsulated nonchondrogenic predifferentiated rabbit adipose stem cells (ASC); (c) gellan gum with encapsulated rabbit articular chondrocytes (AC) (standard control); (d) gellan gum alone (control); (e) empty defect (control). Full-thickness articular cartilage defects were created and the gellan gum constructs were injected and left for 8 weeks. The macroscopic aspect of the explants showed a progressive increase of similarity with the lateral native cartilage, stable integration at the defect site, more pronouncedly in the cell-loaded constructs. Tissue scoring showed that ASC + GF exhibited the best results regarding tissue quality progression. Alcian blue retrieved similar results with a better outcome for the cell-loaded constructs. Regarding real-time PCR analyses, ASC + GF had the best progression with an upregulation of collagen type II and aggrecan, and a downregulation of collagen type I. Gellan gum hydrogels combined with autologous cells constitute a promising approach for the treatment of articular cartilage defects, and adipose derived cells may constitute a valid alternative to currently used articular chondrocytes.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2016.00003,Chondrogenesis of Human Infrapatellar Fat Pad Stem Cells on Acellular Dermal Matrix,"Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been in clinical use for decades in numerous surgical applications. The ability for ADM to promote cellular repopulation, revascularisation and tissue regeneration is well documented. Adipose stem cells have the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissue types, including bone and cartilage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential interaction between ADM and adipose stem cells in vitro using TGFβ3 and BMP6. Human infrapatellar fat pad-derived adipose stem cells (IPFP-ASC) were cultured with ADM derived from rat dermis in chondrogenic (TGFβ3 and BMP6) medium in vitro for 2 and 4 weeks. Histology, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess for markers of chondrogenesis (collagen Type II, SOX9 and proteoglycans). At 4 weeks, cell-scaffold constructs displayed cellular changes consistent with chondrogenesis, with evidence of stratification of cell layers and development of a hyaline-like cartilage layer superficially, which stained positively for collagen Type II and proteoglycans. Significant cell-matrix interaction was seen between the cartilage layer and the ADM itself with seamless integration between each layer. Real time qPCR showed significantly increased COL2A1, SOX9, and ACAN gene expression over 4 weeks when compared to control. COL1A2 gene expression remained unchanged over 4 weeks. We believe that the principles that make ADM versatile and successful for tissue regeneration are applicable to cartilage regeneration. This study demonstrates in vitro the ability for IPFP-ASCs to undergo chondrogenesis, infiltrate, and interact with ADM. These outcomes serve as a platform for in vivo modelling of ADM for cartilage repair.",0

The standard algorithm uses clinical information, conventional radiographs, MRI and CT scan, while the trial algorithm uses the same information but SPECT/CT in addition.MethodsIn a diagnostic comparative trial three experienced surgeons evaluated 23 consecutive patients with persistent symptoms after ACL reconstruction using first standard and second the trial algorithm with a time interval. Each rater had to establish a diagnosis and therapeutic decision with each algorithm. On MRI, graft continuity, bone marrow edema, chondral and meniscal lesions, femoral notch osteophytes were evaluated. Bone tracer uptake in SPECT/CT was anatomically analyzed and compared with MRI findings. MRI findings and SPECT/CT tracer uptake were correlated using Spearman's rho test.ResultsAdditional SPECT/CT analysis did not change diagnosis in any case and did not correlate with clinical graft integrity. Treatment decisions remained unchanged as well. Chondral lesions, arthritic changes, meniscal lesions, graft impingement are best visualized in MRI and showed correspondent tracer uptake in SPECT/CT. Tunnel position was well classified with standard CT scan and showed no correlation with SPECT/CT tracer uptake.ConclusionInformation derived by SPECT/CT in addition to the standard algorithm using clinical information, X-rays, MRI, and CT scan did not change the diagnosis or treatment plan. There is currently no justification to implement SPECT/CT for patients with persistent symptoms after anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions.Level of evidenceLevel II: diagnostic comparative study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1247779,Donor-Site Giant Cell Reaction Following Backfill with Synthetic Bone Material During Osteochondral Plug Transfer,"Osteochondral defects are common in younger, active patients. Multiple strategies have been used to treat these lesions, including microfracture and osteochondral plug transfer. We describe a patient experiencing chronic knee pain and a full-thickness cartilage defect on the lateral femoral condyle. After failing conservative management and microfracture surgery, the patient underwent osteochondral autograft plug transfer, with backfilling of the donor sites using synthetic bone graft substitute. Initial recovery was uncomplicated until the patient experienced pain following a twist of the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging for the subsequent knee injury revealed poor healing at the donor sites. The donor sites were debrided, and specimens revealed a foreign body giant cell reaction. Donor-site morbidity is of primary concern during osteochondral plug transfer; however, insufficient data exist to support the use of synthetic bone graft material. Our results indicate that off-label use of synthetic bone graft substitute during a primary procedure requires further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546508322131,Characteristic Complications after Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation for Cartilage Defects of the Knee Joint,"Background Although autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a well-established therapy for the treatment of isolated cartilage defects of the knee joint, little is known about typical complications and their treatment after ACI. Hypothesis Unsatisfactory outcome after ACI is associated with technique-related typical complications. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods A total of 309 consecutive patients with 349 ACI procedures of the knee joint were analyzed. Three different ACI techniques were used: periosteum-covered ACI in 52 cases (14.9%), Chondrogide (Geistlich Biomaterials, Wolhusen, Switzerland) membrane-covered ACI in 215 cases (61.6%), and a 3-dimensional matrix-associated ACI (BioSeed-C, Biotissue Technologies, Freiburg, Germany) in 82 cases (23.5%). In 52 patients, revision surgery was performed for persistent clinical problems. These patients were analyzed for defect size and location, technique of ACI, and intraoperative findings during revision surgery. The mean time of follow-up for patients after ACI was 4.5 years (standard deviation, ±1.5). Results Four typical major complications were identified: hypertrophy of the transplant, disturbed fusion of the regenerative cartilage and the healthy surrounding cartilage, insufficient regenerative cartilage, and delamination. These diagnoses covered a total of 88.5% of the patients who underwent revision surgery. The overall complication rate was highest in the group of patients treated with periosteum-covered ACI ( P = .008). The incidence of symptomatic hypertrophy was 5.2% for all techniques and defect locations; the highest incidence was in patients treated with periosteum-covered ACI (15.4%) ( P = .001). The incidence of disturbed fusion was highest in the Chondrogide-covered ACI (3.7%) and the matrix-associated ACI group (4.8%). Concerning the incidence of complications by defect location, there was a tendency for increased complications in patellar defects ( P = .095). Within the patellar defects group, no correlation was found for the occurrence of delamination, insufficient regeneration, and disturbed fusion. As a statistical trend, an increased rate of hypertrophy was found for patellar defects ( P = .091). Conclusion A major proportion of complications after ACI can be summarized by 4 major diagnoses (symptomatic hypertrophy, disturbed fusion, delamination, and graft failure). Among those, the overall complication rate and incidence of hypertrophy of the transplant were higher for periosteum-covered ACI. Furthermore, an increased rate of symptomatic hypertrophy was found for patellar defects. Therapeutic concepts need to be developed to treat these typical complications of ACI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/230949901302100104,Medium-Term Outcome of Mosaicplasty for Grade III-IV Cartilage Defects of the Knee,"Purpose. To evaluate the medium-term outcome of mosaicplasty for full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee joint in 17 patients. Methods. Records of 12 men and 5 women aged 16 to 57 (mean, 35) years who underwent mosaicplasty for grade III/IV osteochondral defects in the lateral (n=14) or medial (n=3) femoral condyle were reviewed. 12 of the patients had undergone knee surgeries. The mean size of the defects was 3.4 (range, 1–4) cm2. Three patients had defects of &gt;2 cm2. All operations were performed by a single surgeon using mini-arthrotomy. The lateral edge of the trochlea was the donor site. Graft integration and the presence of any abnormality at the articular surface were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, patients were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating scale, the SF-36 health questionnaire, visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain. Results. Two of the 17 patients developed necrosis and cystic degeneration of the grafts and underwent conversion to unicompartmental knee arthroplasty within 2 years. They were older than 45 years and had defects of &gt;2 cm2. Respectively in years 4 and 7, one and 4 patients were lost to follow-up, the mean IKDC score was 75% and 88%, the SF-36 score was 83% and 90%, and the VAS score was ≤3 in 13 of 14 patients at year 4 and in all 11 patients at year 7. At the 7-year follow-up, patient satisfaction with mosaicplasty was excellent in 8 patients, good in 3, and poor in 2 (who underwent unicompartmental knee arthroplasty). At year 4, MRI showed integration of the cartilage repair tissue and incorporation of the osseous portion of the graft into the bone in 13 of the 14 patients. The remaining patient had osteoarthritis at the graft donor site. At year 7, MRI showed good integration of the implant in all 11 available patients, but fissures were seen on the cartilage surface in 3 patients. Conclusion. The medium-term outcome of autologous mosaicplasty for symptomatic osteochondral defects in the femoral condyle is good.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and histological outcomes of these two techniques.We performed a prospective clinical study to investigate the two-year outcomes in forty patients with an articular cartilage lesion of the femoral condyle who had been randomly treated with either transplantation of an autologous osteochondral cylinder or implantation of autologous chondrocytes. Biopsy specimens from representative patients of both groups were evaluated with histological staining, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy.According to the postoperative Lysholm score, the recovery after autologous chondrocyte implantation was slower than that after osteochondral transplantation at six months (p < or = 0.015), twelve months (p < or = 0.001), and twenty-four months (p < or = 0.012). On the basis of the Meyers score and the Tegner activity score, the results were equally good with the two methods two years after treatment. Histomorphological evaluation of biopsy specimens within two years after autologous chondrocyte implantation demonstrated a complete, mechanically stable resurfacing of the defect in all patients. The tissue consisted mainly of fibrocartilage, while localized areas of hyaline-like regenerative cartilage could be detected close to the subchondral bone. Although a gap remained at the site of the transplantation in all five biopsy specimens examined as long as two years after osteochondral cylinder transplantation, histomorphological analysis and scanning electron microscopy revealed no differences between the osteochondral transplants and the surrounding original cartilage.Both treatments resulted in a decrease in symptoms. However, the improvement provided by the autologous chondrocyte implantation lagged behind that provided by the osteochondral cylinder transplantation. Histologically, the defects treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation were primarily filled with fibrocartilage, whereas the osteochondral cylinder transplants retained their hyaline character, although there was a persistent interface between the transplant and the surrounding original cartilage. Limitations of our study included the small number of patients, the relatively short (two-year) follow-up, and the absence of a control group.",1

Our unit has shown promising early results for the repair of small articular cartilage defects within the knee. Other series have reported ""failures"" in which patients have complained of persistent symptoms and joint effusion at 6 months after plug insertion and arthroplasty has been undertaken. We report a case of delayed incorporation of an articular cartilage defect of the lateral femoral condyle treated with 3 TruFit plugs. The patient eventually reported symptom alleviation and resumption of functional activity after 24 months of continued rehabilitation. We recommend that patients with continued symptoms persevere with rehabilitation and allow the regenerating articular cartilage time to mature fully before considering undertaking irreversible arthroplasty procedures.",0

Materials and methods Fresh epiphyses of 11-day-old embryos were collected from 24 animals and transplanted into defects created in the weight-bearing areas of tibiotarsal joint cartilage of 2-year-old chicks. Upon sacrifice, samples were examined macroscopically and microsections were prepared for histology. Results Macroscopically, control defects remained empty at all the time intervals. Defects of the experimental group were, on the other hand, filled with cartilaginous tissue as early as 2 weeks posttransplantation, although individual epiphyses could still be noted in the implant tissue. At 4 weeks and later, defects were filled with cartilaginous material indistinguishable from hyaline cartilage. Histologically, all grafts remained within the defect's pits, showing mitotic and metabolic activity typical to proliferating hyaline cartilage. The engrafted epiphyses showed a partial incorporation and integration with the surrounding host tissues already at 2 weeks. At 4 weeks and later, the integration was complete. Conclusion It is concluded that a chick embryonic epiphyseal cartilage is suitable as a graft source for articular cartilage transplantation. The embryonic epiphyses provide immediate inherent stability to the graft and supply a good mix of mesenchymal progenitor cells responsible for the high rate of cell proliferation and adhesion to the differentiated committed chondrocytes of the host that create the typical favorable chondrogenic milieu. Based on the present findings, it is postulated that human embryonic epiphyses may, in the future, represent an alternative source to the commonly used techniques of hyaline cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.2006.12.1151,Review of Injectable Cartilage Engineering Using Fibrin Gel in Mice and Swine Models,"More than a decade of work has been devoted to engineering cartilage for articular surface repair. This review covers the use of fibrin gel polymer as an injectable scaffold for generating new cartilage matrix from isolated articular chondrocytes beginning with studies in mice and culminating in an applied study in swine joints. These studies began with developing a formulation of fibrin that was injectable and promoted cartilage matrix formation. Subsequent studies addressed the problems of volume loss after the scaffolds were placed in vivo by adding lyophilized cartilage matrix. Additional studies focused on the ability of isolated chondrocytes to heal and repair cartilage in a model that could be biomechanically tested. In conclusion, this series of studies demonstrated that fibrin gel is a suitable polymer gel for generating new cartilage matrix from articular chondrocytes. The new matrix is capable of forming mechanical bonds between cartilage disks and can lead to healing and integration. Armed with these results, implantation of fibrin-cell constructs into defects in swine knees showed new cartilage formation and filling of the defects. Continuing work in these models with fibrin and other polymerizable hydrogels could result in a suitable cell-based therapy for articular cartilage lesions.",0

The hypothesis was that graft hypertrophy would not be associated with clinical outcome at 24 months.Case series, Level of evidence, 4.This study was undertaken in 180 consecutive patients (113 male, 67 female) after MACI in the knee. All patients were assessed clinically using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The incidence of hypertrophy relevant to anatomic graft site was investigated, as was the progressive change in hypertrophic studies postoperatively. The degree of tissue overgrowth in hypertrophic cases was investigated, as was its association with patient clinical outcome at 24 months after surgery.Of the 180 patients, 50 demonstrated a hypertrophic graft at 1 or more postoperative time points. This included 9 grafts (5.0%) at 3 months and 32 grafts (18.7%) at 12 months. At 24 months, 47 grafts (26.1%)-43 (32.1%) tibiofemoral and 4 (8.7%) patellofemoral-were hypertrophic. Patients with hypertrophic grafts at 24 months (n = 47) were younger (P = .051), they had a lower body mass index (BMI; P = .069), and significantly fewer of them had patellofemoral grafts (P = .007) compared with patients who had grafts with full (100%) tissue infill (n = 61). There were no significant differences in any of the KOOS subscales between patients with graft hypertrophy or full (100%) tissue infill at 24 months after surgery, while the severity of graft hypertrophy was not associated with KOOS subscales at 24 months.Hypertrophic grafts after MACI were common and continued to develop through to 24 months after surgery. Hypertrophic growth was associated with being younger and having a lower BMI, was more common on the femoral condyles, and overall was not associated with clinical outcome at 24 months after surgery. However, further research with longer term follow-up is required to evaluate the effect of persistent hypertrophy on graft stability and to assess the use of early surgical intervention to prevent such failure.",0

A secondary aim was to analyze the association between physeal closure status and outcomes. Methods Consecutive patients aged 18 years or younger who underwent OCA transplantation with a minimum 2-year follow-up were identified from a prospectively collected database. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those aged 16 years or younger (group 1) and those aged 17 to 18 years (group 2). Outcomes included patient-reported outcomes (PROs), complications, reoperations, and cartilage revision surgery. Outcomes were compared between groups, and physeal status was analyzed as a prognostic indicator. Results A total of 36 patients met the inclusion criteria: 18 in group 1 and 18 in group 2. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of demographic characteristics, prior surgical procedures, and surgical details, including concomitant procedures. The mean overall follow-up period was 4.6 ± 2.5 years (range, 2-10.3 years), with no significant difference between the groups (P = .21). There were 10 reoperations (28.8%), 4 in group 1 and 6 in group 2 (P = .47). The overall time to reoperation was 2.8 years and did not significantly differ between groups (P = .75). The failure rate was 5.6%, with 1 patient in each group undergoing either graft debridement or revision OCA transplantation. All PROs were significantly improved postoperatively (P Conclusions OCA transplantation in adolescents results in significant PRO score improvement and a low failure rate, albeit reoperations are not uncommon. Patients with closed physes show greater PRO score improvement than those with open physes. Level of Evidence Level III, retrospective comparative study.",1

The rabbits were either left untreated (control group), treated with intra-articularly injected ADSCs (injected group), or treated by adhering ADSCs (adherent group). The 3 groups were compared at 4, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively using the International Cartilage Repair Society macroscopic scoring system and a modified Wakitani histologic grading system to quantitatively evaluate the regenerated cartilage. The degree of defect repair, integration to the border zone, macroscopic appearance, cell morphology, matrix staining, surface regularity, cartilage thickness, and integration of the donor with the host were evaluated.The mean International Cartilage Repair Society scores in the control, injected, and adherent groups were 6.4 ± 2.9, 7.6 ± 0.8, and 7.6 ± 1.4, respectively, at 4 weeks; 6.2 ± 2.4, 8.2 ± 1.5, and 9.6 ± 1.0, respectively, at 8 weeks; and 7.6 ± 1.0, 8.4 ± 1.4, and 10.2 ± 1.7, respectively, at 24 weeks. Although the scores were higher in the adherent group, no significant difference was noted. The mean modified Wakitani scores in the control, injected, and adherent groups were 3.8 ± 2.0, 5.1 ± 1.8, and 7.8 ± 1.3, respectively, at 4 weeks (P = .041); 5.1 ± 1.0, 5.4 ± 2.7, and 9.6 ± 1.4, respectively, at 12 weeks (P = .016); and 5.4 ± 1.0, 5.9 ± 1.5, and 9.8 ± 1.8, respectively, at 24 weeks (P = .007).The histologic modified Wakitani scores showed that adhering ADSCs to osteochondral cartilage defects was more effective than intra-articular injection for promoting cartilage regeneration.Local adhesion of ADSCs can promote cartilage regeneration and may be a treatment option for cartilage repair.",0

Arthroplasty, the main clinical option to treat osteoarticular lesions, has limitations and drawbacks. In this manuscript, we test the preclinical safety of the innovative implant ARTiCAR for the treatment of osteoarticular lesions. Thanks to the combination of two advanced therapy medicinal products, a polymeric nanofibrous bone wound dressing and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, the ARTiCAR promotes both subchondral bone and cartilage regeneration. In this work, the ARTiCAR shows 1) the feasibility in treating osteochondral defects in a large animal model, 2) the possibility to monitor non-invasively the healing process and 3) the overall safety in two animal models under GLP preclinical standards. Our data indicate the preclinical safety of ARTiCAR according to the international regulatory guidelines; the ARTiCAR could therefore undergo phase I clinical trial.",0

Thus, the authors thought that ""how can this indication regarding age be extended?,"" and tried to find a way to use this technique effectively over 40 years of age. The aim of this study was the first to report the results regarding the PRP as an adjunct for arthroscopic microfracture in the early osteoarthritic (OA) knee with cartilage lesion over 40 years of age. 49 patients who underwent arthroscopic microfracture for cartilage lesion sized less than 4 cm(2) with early OA, aged 40-50 years, were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups: a control group with only arthroscopic microfracture (25 patients) and a study group with arthroscopic microfracture and PRP (24 patients). The patients were prospectively evaluated with VAS, IKDC score at preoperative and postoperative 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. And we perform second arthroscopies in 10 patients of each group to identify the extent of cartilage restoration at 4-6 months postoperatively. There were significant improvements in clinical results between preoperative evaluation and postoperative 2 years in both groups (p = 0.017). In the postoperative 2 years, clinical results showed significantly better in the study group than in the control group (p = 0.012). In post-arthroscopic finding, hardness and elasticity degree was better in the study group.

Outcomes are required to validate the efficacy of MACI as a suitable surgical treatment option for articular cartilage defects in the knee. Hypothesis: A significant improvement in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging–based (MRI-based) outcomes after MACI will exist throughout the postoperative timeline to 5 years after surgery. Furthermore, patient demographics, cartilage defect parameters, and injury/surgery history will be associated with patient and graft outcome, whereas a significant correlation will exist between clinical and MRI-based outcomes at 5 years after surgery. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A prospective evaluation was undertaken to assess clinical and MRI-based outcomes to 5 years in 41 patients (53 grafts) after MACI to the knee. After MACI surgery and a 12-week structured rehabilitation program, patients underwent clinical assessments (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, SF-36, 6-minute walk test, knee range of motion) and MRI assessments at 3, 12, and 24 months, as well as 5 years after surgery. The MRI evaluation assessed 8 previously defined pertinent parameters of graft repair, as well as a combined MRI composite score. Results: A significant improvement ( P &lt; .05) was demonstrated for all Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and SF-36 subscales over the postoperative timeline, as well as the 6-minute walk test and active knee extension. A significant improvement ( P &lt; .0001) was observed for the MRI composite score, as well as several individual graft scoring parameters. At 5 years after surgery, 67% of MACI grafts demonstrated complete infill, whereas 89% demonstrated good to excellent filling of the chondral defect. Patient demographics, cartilage defect parameters, and injury/surgery history demonstrated no significant pertinent correlations with clinical or MRI-based outcomes at 5 years, and no significant correlations existed between clinical and MRI-based outcome measures. At 5 years after surgery, 98% of patients were satisfied with the ability of MACI surgery to relieve knee pain; 86%, with improvement in their ability to perform normal daily tasks; and 73%, with their ability to participate in sport 5 years after MACI. Conclusion: These results suggest that MACI provides a suitable midterm treatment option for articular cartilage defects in the knee. Long-term follow-up is essential to confirm whether the repair tissue has the durability required to maintain long-term patient quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-010-1391-y,The effects of the synovium on chondrocyte growth: an experimental study,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of synovium on the proliferation of the cartilage tissue and chondrocytes using a rabbit knee model as an in vivo synovial culture medium. Twelve New Zealand rabbits were used as the animal model in this investigation. Standard size chondral and osteochondral cartilage grafts were taken from, respectively, the left and right knees of all the animals. Two groups of 6 animals were formed: in Group I (synovium group), grafts were placed into the synovial tissue and in group II (patellar tendon group) behind the patellar tendon of the corresponding knees. After 4 months, samples were collected and evaluated macroscopically by measuring their dimensions (vertical = D1, horizontal = D2, and depth = D3) and volumes, and histologically by counting the chondrocyte number using camera lucida method. Macroscopically, the increase in average D1, D2, and D3 measurements and volume in the osteochondral specimens were significantly higher compared to the chondral specimens in both groups (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of macroscopic values. Histologically, the mean chondrocyte counts in osteochondral and chondral specimens for Group I (synovium) were 20.2 and 18.1, and for Group II (patellar tendon) were 18.7 and 15.6, respectively. The mean number of chondrocytes was found to be significantly higher in osteochondral specimens than that of chondral specimens in either group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Overall average chondrocyte count was significantly higher for Group I compared to Group II (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Transplantation of the cartilage grafts into the synovial tissue in rabbit knees significantly enhanced the chondrocyte production compared with the group where the grafts were transplanted into intra-articular patellar tendon. The results of this study indicate that native synovial tissue may have the potential to be used as an in vivo culture medium for osteochondral tissue growth.",0

Purpose: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of MACI versus MFX in the treatment of patients with symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients enrolled in the SUMMIT (Demonstrate the Superiority of MACI implant to Microfracture Treatment) trial had ≥1 symptomatic focal cartilage defect (Outerbridge grade III or IV; ≥3 cm 2 ) of the femoral condyles or trochlea, with a baseline Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain value &lt;55. The co–primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the KOOS pain and function subscores from baseline to 2 years. Histological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of structural repair tissue, treatment failure, the remaining 3 KOOS subscales, and safety were also assessed. Results: Of the 144 patients treated, 137 (95%) completed the 2-year assessment. Patients had a mean age of 33.8 years and a mean lesion size of 4.8 cm 2 . The mean KOOS pain and function subscores from baseline to 2 years were significantly more improved with MACI than with MFX (pain: MACI, 37.0 to 82.5 vs MFX, 35.5 to 70.9; function: MACI, 14.9 to 60.9 vs MFX, 12.6 to 48.7; P = .001). A significant improvement in scores was also observed on the KOOS subscales of activities of daily living (MACI, 43.5 to 87.2 vs MFX, 42.6 to 75.8; P &lt; .001), knee-related quality of life (MACI, 18.8 to 56.2 vs MFX, 17.2 to 47.3; P = .029), and other symptoms (MACI, 48.3 to 83.7 vs MFX, 44.4 to 72.2; P &lt; .001) for patients treated with MACI compared with MFX. Repair tissue quality was good as assessed by histology/MRI, but no difference was shown between treatments. A low number of treatment failures (nonresponders: MACI, 12.5% vs MFX, 31.9%; P = .016) and no unexpected safety findings were reported. Conclusion: The treatment of symptomatic cartilage knee defects ≥3 cm 2 in size using MACI was clinically and statistically significantly better than with MFX, with similar structural repair tissue and safety, in this heterogeneous patient population. Moreover, MACI offers a more efficacious alternative than MFX with a similar safety profile for the treatment of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the knee.",1
https://doi.org/10.1097/00006416-200509000-00012,Treatment Options for Articular Cartilage Defects of the Knee,"The treatment of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the knee has evolved tremendously in the past decade. Previously, there were limited treatment options available to patients who suffered from either partial-thickness or full-thickness cartilage lesions. Because articular cartilage has a limited capacity for healing, patients were often treated symptomatically until they became candidates for osteotomy or total joint replacement. Recently, both reparative and restorative procedures have been developed to address this significant source of morbidity in young active patients. Microfracture is a reparative technique that induces a healing response to occur in an area of articular cartilage damage. Osteochondral autografts and allografts in addition to autologous chondrocyte implantation are restorative techniques aimed at recreating a more normal articular surface. Both types of procedures have been developed to alleviate the symptoms associated with focal chondral defects, as well as limit their potential to progress to a diffuse degenerative arthritis. Treatment can vary depending on both cartilage defect and patient factors. This article summarizes the various treatment options that have recently become available.",0

The best way to face the challenge is to develop a biomimetic construct to mimic the multilayered gradient from cartilage, to calcified cartilage and subchondral bone. In this study, bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) were cultured on electrospun fibrous meshes and cell sheets were incubated. The fibrous meshes were composed of 50% poly(L-lactide) and 50% gelatin, displaying excellent biocompatibility, cell affinity and degradability. Differentiation of BMSC sheets on fibrous meshes was induced chondrogenically or osteogenically. In particular, the BMSC sheets were able to be efficiently induced differentiating towards calcified cartilage by using a 1:1 (v/v) mixed medium of chondrogenic and osteogenic inductive media. Thus, a gradient 3D construct was built by stacking the differently pre-differentiated cell/mesh complexes layer by layer from top to bottom to mimic the cartilage-to-bone transition. With this gradient construct being implanted in the rabbit knee osteochondral defect, it was confirmed that it could promote the tissue regeneration with intact cartilage layer formation in comparison with the multilayered construct without a gradient. The strategy of using properly pre-differentiated BMSC sheet on fibrous mesh to build the osteochondral interface was thus suggested as being feasible and effective in mimicking its hierarchical complexity, and favored the repairing of injured joint cartilage.",0

Cell-based therapies represent an appealing alternative strategy for cartilage regeneration, and interesting results have been recently reported after intra-articular injections of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results of hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and intra-articular injections of autologous expanded bone marrow - MSCs (BM-MSCs) are reported in this retrospective study.Twenty patients (29 hips) received hip arthroscopy for FAI and focal cartilage injuries or mild to moderate osteoarthrosis (OA). Three intra-articular injections of 20×106 BM-MSCs were injected from 4 to 6 weeks postoperative. The modified Harris Hip score (mHHS), the WOMAC score, the VAIL score and VAS score were administered to all patients.The mean age of the patients was 51.8 years, and the mean follow-up was 24 months. The median preoperative mHHS, WOMAC and VAIL scores were 64.3, 73 and 56.5 respectively, and they increased to 91, 97 and 83 at final follow up (p<0.05). The VAS score also improved from a median of 6 to 2. Four patients received a THA (13% of the hips) at the median of 9 months post intervention (range 6-36 months). Six patients referred pain after the injection of MSCs, which improved with oral pain killers. No major complications were reported.BM-MSCc injections in combination with hip arthroscopy may improve the quality of life and functional score in patient with FAI and cartilage injuries which are still not candidate to a THA.IV case series.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/ar613,,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation is being used increasingly for the treatment of cartilage defects. In spite of this, there has been a paucity of objective, standardised assessment of the outcome and quality of repair tissue formed.

Results indicate repair tissue to be on average 2.5 mm thick. It was of varying morphology ranging from predominantly hyaline in 22% of biopsy specimens, mixed in 48%, through to predominantly fibrocartilage, in 30%, apparently improving with increasing time postgraft. Repair tissue was well integrated with the host tissue in all aspects viewed. MRI scans provide a useful assessment of properties of the whole graft area and adjacent tissue and is a noninvasive technique for long-term follow-up.

,[Osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyles: report of 892 cases].,"Osteochondritis rarely involves the femoral condyles. Discovery in this localization raises several questions concerning the nature of the articular cartilage, the potential for spontaneous healing, and, in the event of a free fragment, the outcome after its loss or repair.This multicentric study included 892 pediatric and adult cases, the cutoff between two series being defined by fusion of the inferior growth plate. We excluded medical or surgical osteochondritis, cases involving the patella, osteochondral fractures, juvenile polyosteochondrosis, adult osteonecrosis, and osteochondritis beginning after the age of 50 years.Mean age at diagnosis was 16.5 years. Mean age at treatment onset was 22 years. Pain was the predominant symptom. 80% of cases were unilateral and 70% involved the medial condyle. The anatomic lesions were different in adults, showing more advanced degradation. At diagnosis, Bedouelle stages Ia and IIb constituted 80% of the cases observed among children while in adults, 66% were Bedouelle stages IIb to IV. Outcome was very good for the majority of children with Hughston clinical stage 4 while half of the x-rays were Hughston stage 3 and 4. There were thus a large percentage of children with abnormal xrays whose disease history was not yet terminated. In the adult series, the percentages of Hughston 3 and 4 was about the same as clinically. The x-rays were rarely perfectly normal since half of the clinical stage 3 patients were noted in stage 4. An abnormal x-ray with a very good clinical presentation was observed in a very large proportion of patients.It is difficult to interpret the plain x-ray and identify patients with a potentially unfavorable prognosis. We defined three radiographic classes: defect, nodule and empty notch. The Bedouelle classification uses information from all available explorations, particularly MRI and arthroscopy. Numerous therapeutic methods are used. Interruption of sports activities is the first intention treatment for children. Data in the literature and the findings of this symposium do not demonstrate any beneficial effect of immobilization on healing compared with simple abstention from sports activities. Transchondral perforation is a simple operation with low morbidity. In 85% of cases, it was used for lesions with an intact joint cartilage considered stable in 96% of cases. Healing was achieved in six months for 48% if the growth plate had not fused. The fragment was fixed in 43% of the cases with a loose cartilage fragment. Outcome was fair but degraded with the state of the joint cartilage and thus the stability of the fragment. Fixation must stabilize the fragment but not prevent further consolidation via osteogenesis. This is why deep perforations are drilled beyond the ossified area and additional osteochondral grafts are used. The Wagner operation gives less satisfactory results than more complicated procedures. Removal of a sequestrum is a simple, minimally invasive procedure with an uneventful postoperative period, but in the long term it favors osteoarthritic degradation, especially when performed in adults. Mosaic grafts give good mid term results. Morbidity is low especially if the grafts are harvested above the notch. The question of chondrolysis around the grafts was beyond the scope of this study. Chondrocyte grafting is difficult to accomplish and is expensive. The mid term results are good for large lesions. Osteotomy is logical only in the event of early stage osteoarthritic degradation. DECISION ALGORITHM IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: If the plain x-ray reveals a defect (class I), simple interruption of sports activities should be proposed. Two situations can then develop. First, in a certain number of patients, the pain disappears as the defective zone ossifies progressively. Complete cure is frequent before the age of 12 years. In the second situation, the knee remains painful and the x-ray does not change or worsens to a class II nodular formation. In this case an MRI must be obtained to determine whether the joint cartilage is normal. There are two possibilities. First, the osteochondral fragment is viable and most probably will become completely re-integrated, particularly if the lesion is far from the growth plate. Necrosis is the other possibility. Transchondral perforations are needed in this case. If on the contrary the cartilage is altered, there is little hope for spontaneous cure. Arthroscopy may be needed to complete the exploration. Fragments, especially if there is a large surface area, must be fixed. Perforations to favor revascularization are certainly useful here. In the last situation (class III), the fragment wobbles on a thin attachment or has already fallen into the joint space. This is the type of problem generally observed in adults. The decision algorithm in adults is the same as in children for the rare nodular aspects (class II). There could be a discussion between transcartilage perforation and fixation. If there are a large number of fragments, fixation may not be fully successful and the lesion might be considered class III. For class III lesions, three operations can be used: removal of the sequestrum, mosaic bone-cartilage grafts, or autologous chondrocyte grafts. At the same follow-up, mosaic grafts give better results than excision of sequestra. It may be useful to remove sequestra in a limited number of situations: if there is just a small area of osteochondritis, the lesion is old and partially healed, or the zone is non weight-bearing. For other lesions, we favor mosaic grafts. We still do not have enough follow-up to assess the long-term outcome with these mosaic grafts, but simple excision clearly favors osteoarthritic degradation. Can chondrocytes grafts be compared with mosaic grafts? Chondrocyte grafts have been used for very large lesions and have given results similar to mosaic grafts. It might also be possible to combine fixation of a loose fragment and a mosaic graft. LESSONS FROM THIS STUDY: 1) The prognosis of osteochondritis is better before than after fusion of the growth plate but the lesion does not always heal in children. 2) Presence of osteochondritis requires complementary anatomic and functional exploration to determine the stability and the vitality of the fragment. 3) Attention must be taken to perform transchondral perforations early enough, particularly in children. 4) Screw fixation is not always sufficient. The trophicity of the fragment and its blood supply must be improved. 5) Mosaic grafts are preferable to excision of the fragment. 6) Chondrocyte grafts will be more widely used in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603520918630,Arthroscopic Matrix-Encapsulated Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation: A Pilot Multicenter Investigation in Latin America,"Objective. To evaluate minimum biosecurity parameters (MBP) for arthroscopic matrix-encapsulated autologous chondrocyte implantation (AMECI) based on patients’ clinical outcomes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-mapping, Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score, and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) second-look arthroscopic evaluation, laying the basis for a future multicenter study. Design. Pilot clinical study. We analyzed the logistics to perform AMECI to treat focal chondral lesions in different hospitals following strict biosecurity parameters related to tissue and construct transportation, chondrocyte isolation, and cell expansion. Patient progress was analyzed with patient-reported outcome measures, MRI T2-mapping, MOCART, and ICRS arthroscopic second-look evaluation. Results. Thirty-five lesions in 30 patients treated in 7 different hospitals were evaluated. Cell viability before implantation was &gt;90%. Cell viability in construct remnants was 87% ± 11% at 24 hours, 75% ± 17.1% at 48 hours, and 60% ± 8% at 72 hours after implantation. Mean final follow-up was 37 months (12-72 months). Patients showed statistically significant improvement in all clinical scores and MOCART evaluations. MRI T2-mapping evaluation showed significant decrease in relaxation time from 61.2 ± 14.3 to 42.9 ± 7.2 ms ( P &lt; 0.05). Arthroscopic second-look evaluation showed grade II “near normal” tissue in 83% of patients. Two treatment failures were documented. Conclusions. It was feasible to perform AMECI in 7 different institutions in a large metropolitan area following our biosecurity measures without any implant-related complication. Treated patients showed improvement in clinical, MRI T2-mapping, and MOCART scores, as well as a low failure rate and a favorable ICRS arthroscopic evaluation at a mid-term follow-up.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-05884-y,Articular cartilage repair using autologous collagen-induced chondrogenesis (ACIC): a pragmatic and cost-effective enhancement of a traditional technique,"PURPOSE: The autologous collagen-induced chondrogenesis technique is described, and the results of a 6-year follow-up clinical study using this technique are presented. METHODS: 30 patients with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Grade III/IVa symptomatic chondral defects of the knee treated with enhanced microdrilling using atelocollagen were prospectively examined in this clinical series. The median age of the patients was 39.0 years (range 19-61 years). Patients were followed up to 72 months. Clinical evaluation was performed using functional knee scores and radiologically. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments were performed. RESULTS: Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement was observed in 2 years and was sustained for the 6 years of the study observation. At 6 years, the mean Lysholm score was 79.7 (SD 6.8) compared to 52.6 (SD 10.7) pre-operatively (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). The symptomatic Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) improved from 68.3 (SD 11.4) to 90.2 (SD 4.3) (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). The subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) also showed improvement from 39.1 (SD 4.1) to 81.6 (SD 7.8) (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). The calculated T2* relaxation times were 26.0 (SD 4.2) seconds and 30.3 (SD 6.2) seconds for the repair tissue and native cartilage, respectively. The average magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was 78.5 (SD 9.6) for all lesions. CONCLUSION: The enhanced microdrilling using atelocollagen is an enhancement of the traditional microfracture method using an off-the-shelf product. When used to treat moderate to severe chondral lesions, this enhancement produces hyaline-like cartilage with a corresponding improvement in symptoms. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546508328415,The Efficacy of Intra-Articular Hyaluronan Injection after the Microfracture Technique for the Treatment of Articular Cartilage Lesions,"Background Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated, recent animal studies have demonstrated chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of hyaluronic acid viscosupplementation. Hypothesis Intra-articular hyaluronic acid after microfracture improves the quality of the repair leading to a more hyaline-like repair tissue with better defect fill and adjacent area integration. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Full-thickness cartilage defects were created in the weightbearing area of the medial femoral condyle in 36 female New Zealand White rabbits. The defects were then treated with surgical microfracture. Eighteen rabbits formed the 3-month cohort and the other 18 formed the 6-month cohort. Within each cohort, 6 rabbits were randomly assigned to receive 3 weekly injections of hyaluronic acid (group A), 5 weekly injections (group B), or control injections of normal saline (group C). At 3 and 6 months postmicrofracture, the animals were sacrificed and the operative knee harvested. Repair tissue was assessed blinded— both grossly, using a modified component of the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment scoring scale, and histologically, using the modified O'Driscoll histological cartilage scoring system. Comparisons were made with respect to gross and histologic findings between treatment groups at each time point. Effects of each treatment type were also evaluated longitudinally by comparing the 3-month results with the 6-month results. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student t tests with significance defined as P &lt; .05. Results At 3 months, gross and histologic evaluation of the repair tissue demonstrated that the 3-injection group had significantly better fill of the defects and more normal appearing, hyaline-like tissue than controls (a mean ICRS score of 1.92 vs 1.26; P &lt; .05 and a mean modified O'Driscoll score of 10.3 vs 7.6; P &lt; .02). Specimens treated with 5 weekly injections were not significantly improved compared with controls. At 6 months, the mean gross appearance and histologic scores between the 3 specimen cohorts were not significantly different. However, examination of the entire operative knee demonstrated a significantly greater extent of degenerative changes (synovial inflammation and osteophyte formation) in the control group than in both hyaluronic acid treatment groups (P &lt; .05). Conclusion Supplementing the microfracture technique with 3 weekly injections of intra-articular hyaluronic acid had a positive effect on the repair tissue that formed within the chondral defect at the early follow-up time point. This improvement was not found for the 3-injection group at 6 months or for the 5-injection group at either time point. Additionally, hyaluronic acid supplementation had a possible chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect, limiting the development of degenerative changes within the knee joint. Clinical Relevance The adjunctive use of hyaluronic acid appears to hold promise in the treatment of chondral injuries and warrants further investigation.",0

Here, we report two first-in-man cases (patient A and B) treated with combined autologous chondrocyte and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell implantation (CACAMI), with 8-year follow up. Two patients with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III–IV cartilage lesions underwent a co-implantation of autologous chondrocytes and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) between February 2008 and October 2009. In brief, chondrocytes and BM-MSCs were separately isolated and culture-expanded in a good manufacturing practice laboratory for a period of 2–4 weeks. Cells were then implanted in combination into cartilage defects and patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, using the self-reported Lysholm knee score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Postoperative Lysholm scores were compared with the Oswestry risk of knee arthroplasty (ORKA) scores. Patient A also had a second-look arthroscopy, at which time a biopsy of the repair site was taken. Both patients demonstrated a significant long-term improvement in knee function, with postoperative Lysholm scores being consistently higher than ORKA predictions. The most recent Lysholm scores, 8 years after surgery were 100/100 (Patient A) and 88/100 (Patient B), where 100 represents a fully functioning knee joint. Bone marrow lesion (BML) volume was shown to decrease on postoperative MRIs in both patients. Cartilage defect area increased in patient A, but declined initially for patient B, slightly increasing again 2 years after treatment. The repair site biopsy taken from patient A at 14 months postoperatively, demonstrated a thin layer of fibrocartilage covering the treated defect site. The use of a combination of cultured autologous chondrocytes and BM-MSCs appears to confer long-term benefit in this two-patient case study. Improvements in knee function perhaps relate to the observed reduction in the size of the BML.",0
,[Surgical treatment options for weight bearing articular surface defect].,"Treatment of full thickness defects of weight bearing articular surfaces is one of the most challenging problem of the daily orthopaedic practice. Recently published statistical evaluations of different arthroscopic findings support that 80% of full thickness defects of weight bearing areas leads to early osteoarthritis in a 5-10 years period. Beside traditional resurfacing procedures in the last two decades several new techniques have been developed to promote a hyaline or hyaline-like repair of the defected area. Basic science data, experimental results and preclinical evaluations supported wide clinical use of microfracture technique and autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty. Insurance company data confirm that yearly more, than 200 000 resurfacing procedures are performed according to the above mentioned two techniques all over the world. Beside these two popular resurfacing options autologous chondrocyte implantation may be a promising future alternative to treat extended defect areas. Beside basic science information and experimental data clinical experiences of more, than 8000 human implantations support such an application of cell therapy. This paper gives an outline of actual clinical resurfacing options and summarizes recent advances of cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603516670708,Evaluation and Management of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common injuries that affect a wide variety of active patients. The majority of these lesions are associated with ankle sprains and fractures though several nontraumatic etiologies have also been recognized. Patients normally present with a history of prior ankle injury and/or instability. In addition to standard ankle radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are used to characterize the extent of the lesion and involvement of the subchondral bone. Symptomatic nondisplaced lesions can often be treated conservatively within the pediatric population though this treatment is less successful in adults. Bone marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture have yielded favorable results for the treatment of small (&lt;15 mm) lesions. Osteochondral autograft can be harvested most commonly from the ipsilateral knee and carries the benefit of repairing defects with native hyaline cartilage. Osteochondral allograft transplant is reserved for large cystic lesions that lack subchondral bone integrity. Cell-based repair techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation have been increasingly used in an attempt to repair the lesion with hyaline cartilage though these techniques require adequate subchondral bone. Biological agents such as platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow aspirate have been more recently studied as an adjunct to operative treatment but their use remains theoretical. The present article reviews the current concepts in the evaluation and management of osteochondral lesions of the talus, with a focus on the available surgical treatment options.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546512445167,A Randomized Trial Comparing Accelerated and Traditional Approaches to Postoperative Weightbearing Rehabilitation After Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: While structured postoperative rehabilitation after matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) is considered critical, very little has been made available on how best to progressively increase weightbearing and exercise after surgery. Hypothesis: A significant improvement will exist in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based scoring measures to 5 years after surgery. Furthermore, there will be no significant differences in outcomes in MACI patients at 5 years when comparing a traditional and an accelerated postoperative weightbearing regimen. Finally, patient demographics, cartilage defect parameters, and injury/surgery history will be associated with graft outcome. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Clinical and radiological outcomes were studied in 70 patients who underwent MACI to the medial or lateral femoral condyle, in conjunction with either an “accelerated” or a “traditional” approach to postoperative weightbearing rehabilitation. Under the accelerated protocol, patients reached full weightbearing at 8 weeks after surgery, compared with 11 weeks for the traditional group. Clinical measures (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36], visual analog scale [VAS], 6-minute walk test, and knee range of motion) were assessed before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months and 5 years after surgery. High-resolution MRI was undertaken at 3, 12, and 24 months and 5 years after surgery and assessed 8 previously defined pertinent parameters of graft repair as well as a combined MRI composite score. The association between clinical and MRI-based outcomes, patient demographics, chondral defect parameters, and injury/surgery history was investigated. Results: Of the 70 patients recruited, 63 (31 accelerated, 32 traditional) underwent clinical follow-up at 5 years; 58 (29 accelerated, 29 traditional) also underwent radiological assessment. A significant time effect ( P &lt; .05) was demonstrated for all clinical and MRI-based scores over the 5-year period. While the VAS demonstrated significantly less frequent pain at 5 years in the accelerated group, there were no other significant differences between the 2 groups. Between 24 months and 5 years, a significant improvement ( P &lt; .05) in both groups was observed for the sport and recreation subscale of the KOOS as well as a significant decrease ( P &lt; .05) in active knee extension for the traditional group. There were no significant differences ( P &gt; .05) in the MRI-based scores between 24 months and 5 years after surgery. Patient age and defect size exhibited significant negative correlations ( P &lt; .05) with several MRI-based outcomes at 5 years, while there were no significant correlations ( P &gt; .05) between clinical and MRI-based outcomes. At 5 years after surgery, 94% and 95% were satisfied with the ability of MACI to relieve their knee pain and improve their ability to undertake daily activities, respectively. Conclusion: The outcomes of this randomized trial demonstrate a safe and effective accelerated rehabilitation protocol as well as a regimen that provides comparable, if not superior, clinical outcomes to patients throughout the postoperative timeline.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967118776944,Outcomes of Joint Preservation Procedures for Cartilage Injuries in the Hip: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: The detection and management of chondral injuries of the hip, especially in a younger patient population, may preempt joint degeneration. Although the outcomes of preservation techniques have been well described for other weightbearing joints, such as the knee, evidence for hip joint preservation after procedures such as microfracture and autologous chondrocyte implantation remains in its infancy. Purpose: To evaluate outcomes of joint preservation procedures in the hip, including the success rate and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This review was performed using the terms “hip arthroscopy,” “microfracture,” “autologous chondrocyte implantation,” “fibrin glue,” “osteochondral transfer,” and variations thereof in 5 electronic databases, yielding 325 abstracts. After the application of eligibility criteria, 19 articles were included. Weighted means were calculated for PROs, and pooled estimates were calculated for age, follow-up, chondral lesion size, and success of hip preservation procedures with a random-effects proportion meta-analysis. Results: A total of 1484 patients (1502 hips) were identified across 19 studies (mean age, 38.0 ± 1.3 years; mean follow-up, 31.8 ± 9.6 months). Hip joint preservation techniques demonstrated a high success rate, ranging from 85.6% to 99.7%. The mean pooled chondral lesion size was 2.5 ± 0.3 cm 2 (95% CI, 1.9-3.0 cm 2 ). Microfracture was the most frequent technique, utilized by 11 studies, and demonstrated an 89.6% success rate (95% CI, 82.4%-96.7%). The highest pooled success rate was exhibited by autologous membrane-induced chondrogenesis in 3 studies (99.7% [95% CI, 99.0%-100.0%]). All PROs demonstrated a statistically significant increase postoperatively, including the modified Harris Hip Score, Nonarthritic Hip Score, and Hip Outcome Score–Activities of Daily Living and Hip Outcome Score–Sports-Specific Subscale (all P &lt; .05). The visual analog scale for pain also demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of 37.2% ( P &lt; .05). Conclusion: Hip preservation procedures demonstrate a high success rate, with microfracture representing the most frequently utilized cartilage preservation technique in the peer-reviewed literature. PROs significantly improved after surgery. Further investigation of hip preservation modalities with long-term follow-up is required to create evidence-based clinical recommendations and treatment algorithms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.02.022,PLGA-based microcarriers induce mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis and stimulate cartilage repair in osteoarthritis,"In the present study, we aimed at evaluating the ability of novel PLGA-P188-PLGA-based microspheres to induce the differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) into chondrocytes. To this aim, we tested microspheres releasing TGFβ3 (PAM-T) in vitro and in situ, in a pathological osteoarthritic (OA) environment. We first evaluated the chondrogenic differentiation of human MSCs seeded onto PAM-T in vitro and confirmed the up-regulation of chondrogenic markers while the secretome of the cells was not changed by the 3D environment. We then injected human MSC seeded onto PAM-T in the knee joints of mice with collagenase-induced OA. After 6 weeks, histological analysis revealed that formation of a cartilage-like tissue occurred at the vicinity of PAM-T that was not observed when MSCs were seeded onto PAM. We also noticed that the endogenous articular cartilage was less degraded. The extent of cartilage protection was further analysed by confocal laser microscopy. When MSCs seeded onto PAM-T were injected early after OA induction, protection of cartilage against degradation was evidenced and this effect was associated to a higher survival of MSCs in presence of TGFβ3. This study points to the interest of using MSCs seeded onto PAM for cartilage repair and stimulation of endogenous cartilage regeneration.",0

Patients were prospectively evaluated for 4 years. All patients were evaluated with MRI, KOOS, IKDC, VAS and Tegner scores preoperatively and at two-year and final follow-up.At final follow-up, all scores significantly improved (P < 0.001) as follows: all KOOS score categories; Tegner 2 (range 0-4) to 6 (range 4-8) and 3 (range 0-6) to 6 (range 3-10); IKDC subjective (39.2 ± 16.5 to 82.2 ± 8.9) and (40.8 ± 13.9 to 79.4 ± 14.6), in the study and control group respectively. In addition, we show that results are affected by lesion size and number but not from concomitant surgical procedures. MRI showed complete filling in 80 % of patients in the study group and 71 % of patients in the control group. Histological analysis conducted in three patients from the study and two patients from the control group revealed good tissue repair with a variable amount of hyaline-like tissue.Treatment of cartilage lesions with BMAC and Hyalofast is a viable and effective option that is mainly affected by lesion size and number and not by age. In particular, it allows to address the >45 years population with functional outcomes that are comparable to younger patients at final follow-up.Prospective cohort study, Level II.",1
https://doi.org/10.5435/jaaos-d-20-00266,Cartilage Injury in the Knee: Assessment and Treatment Options,"Cartilage injuries in the knee are common and can occur in isolation or in combination with limb malalignment, meniscus, ligament, and bone deficiencies. Each of these problems must be addressed to achieve a successful outcome for any cartilage restoration procedure. If nonsurgical management fails, surgical treatment is largely based on the size and location of the cartilage defect. Preservation of the patient's native cartilage is preferred if an osteochondral fragment can be salvaged. Chondroplasty and osteochondral autograft transfer are typically used to treat small (<2 cm) cartilage defects. Microfracture has not been shown to be superior to chondroplasty alone and has potential adverse effects, including cyst and intralesional osteophyte formation. Osteochondral allograft transfer and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation are often used for larger cartilage defects. Particulated juvenile allograft cartilage is another treatment option for cartilage lesions that has good to excellent short-term results but long-term outcomes are lacking.",0

Levels I-IV evidence were included. Generations of ACI and complications after ACI were explicitly defined. All subject and defect demographic data were analyzed. Modified Coleman Methodology Scores (MCMSs) were calculated for all studies.82 studies were identified for inclusion (5276 subjects were analyzed; 6080 defects). Ninety percent of the studies in this review were rated poor according to the MCMS. There were 305 failures overall (5.8% subjects; mean time to failure 22 months). Failure rate was highest with periosteal ACI (PACI). Failure rates after PACI, collagen-membrane cover ACI (CACI), second generation, and all-arthroscopic, second-generation ACI were 7.7%, 1.5%, 3.3%, and 0.83%, respectively. The failure rate of arthrotomy-based ACI was 6.1% vs 0.83% for all-arthroscopic ACI. Overall rate of re-operation was 33%. Re-operation rate after PACI, CACI, and second-generation ACI was 36%, 40%, and 18%, respectively. However, upon exclusion of planned second-look arthroscopy, re-operation rate was highest after PACI. Unplanned re-operation rates after PACI, CACI, second-generation, and all-arthroscopic second-generation ACI were 27%, 5%, 5%, and 1.4%, respectively. Low numbers of patients undergoing third-generation ACI precluded comparative analysis of this group.Failure rate after all ACI generations is low (1.5-7.7%). Failure rate is highest with PACI, and lower with CACI and second-generation techniques. One out of three ACI patients underwent a re-operation. Unplanned re-operations are seen most often following PACI. Hypertrophy and delamination is most commonly seen after PACI. Arthrofibrosis is most commonly seen after arthrotomy-based ACI. Use of a collagen-membrane cover, second-generation techniques, and all-arthroscopic, second-generation approaches have reduced the failure, complication, and re-operation rate after ACI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2018.12.005,Optimization strategies for ACI: A step-chronicle review,"Bearing compression from adjacent joints, the articular cartilage is cumulatively pressured in daily life, thus making it prone to injuries; however, once damaged, the self-healing capacity of articular cartilage is limited owing to its low metabolic property. Autologous chondrocyte implantation, a three-step repairing technique for articular lesions, has received satisfactory short-term clinical outcomes, whereas its long-term effect remains controversial. Currently, improved stem-cell therapies and novel biomaterials have shed new lights on autologous chondrocyte implantation. We would, therefore, synthesize these optimization strategies in order of their presences in the three-step protocol, seeking to find and amplify synergic effects between these strategies.Autologous chondrocytes implantation serves as an alternative for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions to avoid potentially detrimental effects of applying microfracture. The optimized ACI should improve the cost-effectiveness of repairing articular cartilage while circumventing latent complications like osteophyte. This article synthesized optimization strategies for ACI and provided appropriate applying approaches to maximize their synergic effects. It will be a pioneering trial for combinedly using stem cells and nanotechnology to regenerate cartilage.",0

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12], Tegner, and Marx) and custom RTP surveys were administered. All subsequent reoperations were documented.Thirteen athletes (4 intercollegiate, 9 high-school) were identified with an average follow-up of 5.9 ± 2.5 years. Seven athletes (54%) returned to competitive sport at an average of 7.9 ± 3.5 months, 5 of whom returned to preinjury functional levels. Of the 8 athletes who either did not return to competitive sport or failed to sustain their high level of play, the most common reasons cited were graduation from high school or college (4 patients, 50%) or fear of reinjury (3 patients, 38%). All 4 patients citing graduation as the primary factor preventing return to preinjury level of competitive sport resumed recreational sport without limitations, yielding an adjusted RTP rate of 10 patients (77%) who either returned to competitive play or believed they could return if they had not graduated. At final follow-up, athletes reported significant improvements in all PRO scores except for KOOS-Sport, WOMAC-Stiffness, and SF-12 Mental subscales. There were 3 reoperations at an average of 3.8 ± 3.3 years after the index OCA. There were no instances of graft failure.OCAs provide an adjusted RTP rate of 77% for high-level adolescent athletes. Social factors may be more likely than persistent pain to prevent return to sport.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0
,Penehyclidine hydrochloride postconditioning ameliorates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury: critical role of mitochondrial ATP sensitive potassium channel.,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) leads to disability and death worldwide. However, limited approaches have been made in developing therapies to decrease the detrimental effects of CI/R. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) postconditioning on CI/R injury and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In CI/R rats, we showed that PHC postconditioning could effectively inhibit I/R-induced brain infarction and edema, and deficit of neurological function. In addition, PHC postconditioning significantly inhibited I/R-induced increase of proinflammatory cytokines and TUNEL-positive cell numbers. Moreover, the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and oxidative stress resulting from I/R were suppressed notably by PHC postconditioning, as evidenced by increased absorbance at 540 nm in Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling test and increased SOD activity and decreased ROS and MDA level. 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), a specific inhibitor of MitoKATP, was used to evaluate the role of MitoKATP in the neuroprotective effect of PHC postconditioning. The results showed that 5-HD could markedly suppress PHC postconditioning-caused inhibition of brain infarction and edema, deficit of neurological function, inflammation, apoptosis, opening of mPTP and oxidative stress induced by CI/R. The results demonstrated that PHC postconditioning could protect against I/R injury in brain through the inhibition of oxidative stress, mPTP opening, apoptosis and inflammation. Activation of MitoKATP was critical for PHC postconditioning-exhibited neuro-protective effects against I/R injury. These findings may provide a novel foundation for therapeutic strategies targeting cerebral protection against I/R damage.",1

Magnetic resonance imaging also assessed the interface between the repaired and native cartilage, changes in the subchondral bone, and the appearance of cartilage over the opposite and adjacent (native) surfaces. One hundred eighty magnetic resonance imaging examinations were obtained in 112 patients who had cartilage-resurfacing procedures, including 86 microfractures and 35 autologous chondrocyte implantations, at a mean of 15 and 13 months after surgery, respectively. Autologous chondrocyte implantations showed consistently better fill of the defects at all times compared with microfracture. The graft hypertrophied in 63% of surgeries. The repair cartilage over the microfracture generally was depressed with respect to native cartilage. Propensity for bony overgrowth was most marked in the microfracture group, with loss of adjacent cartilage evident with progressive followup.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.1100170404,Enhanced repair of extensive articular defects by insulin-like growth factor-I-laden fibrin composites,"Stem cells indigenous to the cancellous spaces of the bone bed in an acute injury provide an important source of pluripotent cells for cartilage repair. Insulin-like growth factor-I facilitates chondrogenesis of bone marrow-derived stem cells in long-term culture and may enhance chondrogenesis in healing cartilage lesions in vivo. This study examined the impact of insulin-like growth factor-I, gradually released from fibrin clots polymerized in situ, on the recruitable stem-cell pool in a full-thickness critical cartilage defect model. Twelve full-thickness 15-mm cartilage lesions in the femoropatellar articulations of six young mature horses were repaired by an injection of autogenous fibrin containing 25 microg of human recombinant insulin-like growth factor-I or, in control joints, fibrin without the growth factor. All horses were killed at 6 months, and cartilage repair tissue and surrounding cartilage were assessed by histology, histochemistry, types I and II collagen immunohistochemistry, types I and II collagen in situ hybridization, and matrix biochemical determinations. White tissue filled grafted and control lesions, with the growth factor-treated defects being more completely filled and securely attached to the subchondral bone. A moderately improved chondrocyte population, more columnar cellular organization, and better attachment to the underlying bone were evident on histological evaluation of growth factor-treated defects. Type-II procollagen mRNA was abundantly present in the deeper half of the treated sections compared with moderate message expression in control tissues. Immunolocalization of type-II collagen showed a preponderance of the collagen in growth factor-treated lesions, confirming translation of type-II message to protein. Composite histologic healing scores for treated defects were significantly improved over those for control defects. DNA content in the cartilage defects was similar in treated and control joints. Matrix proteoglycan content was similar in treated and control defects and lower in the defects than in the intact surrounding and remote cartilage of the treated and control joints. The proportion of type-II collagen significantly increased in growth factor-treated tissues. Fibrin polymers laden with insulin-like growth factor-I improved the histologic appearance and the proportion of type-II collagen in healing, full-thickness cartilage lesions. However, none of the biochemical or morphologic features were consistent with those of normal articular cartilage.",0

The challenge of translating initial successes in small laboratory animals into the clinics involves pilot studies in large animal models, where safety and efficacy should be investigated during prolonged follow-up periods. Here we present, in a single study, the long-term (up to 1 year) effect of biocompatible porous scaffolds non-seeded and seeded with fresh ex vivo expanded autologous progenitor cells that were derived from three different cell sources [cartilage, fat and bone marrow (BM)] in order to evaluate their advantages as cartilage resurfacing agents. An ovine model of critical size osteochondral focal defect was used and the test items were implanted arthroscopically into the knees. Evidence of regeneration of hyaline quality tissue was observed at 6 and 12 months post-treatment with variable success depending on the cell source. Cartilage and BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), but not those derived from fat, resulted in the best quality of new cartilage, as judged qualitatively by magnetic resonance imaging and macroscopic assessment, and by histological quantitative scores. Given the limitations in sourcing cartilage tissue and the risk of donor site morbidity, BM emerges as a preferential source of MSC for novel cartilage resurfacing therapies of osteochondral defects using copolymeric poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide scaffolds.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-018-3800-7,Application of combined porous tantalum scaffolds loaded with bone morphogenetic protein 7 to repair of osteochondral defect in rabbits*,"Purpose Porous tantalum (PT) has been widely used in orthopaedic applications for low modulus of elasticity, excellent biocompatibility, and the microstructures similar to cancellous bone. In order to improve the biological activity of PT, biologically active factors can be combined with the material. The purpose of this study was to investigate if bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) modifications could enhance the repairing of cartilage of PT in osteochondral defect in medial femoral condyle of rabbits. Methods A cylindrical osteochondral defect model was created on the animal medial femoral condyle of and filled as fol lows: PT modified with BMP-7 for MPT group, non-modified PT for the PT group, while no implants were used for the blank group. The regenerated osteochondral tissue was assessed and analyzed by histological observations at four, eight and 16 weeks post-operation and evaluated in an independent and blinded manner by five different observers using a histological score. Osteochondral and subchondral bone defect repair was assessed by micro-CT scan at 16 weeks post-operation, while the biomechanical test was performed at 16 weeks post-operation. Results Briefly, higher overall histological score was observed in the MPT group compared to PT group. Furthermore, more new osteochondral tissue and bone formed at the interface and inside the inner pores of scaffolds of the MPT group compared to PT group. Additionally, the micro-CT data suggested that the new bone volume fractions and the quantity and quality of trabecular bone, as well as the maximum release force of the bone, were higher in the MPT group compared to PT group. Conclusions We demonstrated that the applied modified PT with BMP-7 promotes excellent subchondral bone regeneration and may serve as a novel approach for osteochondral defects repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-022-05380-7,Results of the osteochondral autologous transplantation for treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus with harvesting from the ipsilateral talar articular facets,"Purpose There are few studies on the clinical outcomes of osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) harvesting from local talar non-weight-bearing articular facets for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). The purpose of this study was to review the short- to midterm outcomes of our patients who were treated with OAT harvesting from ipsilateral talar articular facets for OLTs. Methods Between December 2010 and November 2018, 24 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 16 males and eight females with an average age of 39.1 years and a follow-up period of 50.9 months. The clinical results were evaluated according to the American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score and the visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Pre-operative plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, post-operative radiographs, and X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans at the last follow-up were observed. Results There was a significant improvement in the AOFAS score from 61.3 +/- 19.0 pre-operatively to 84.9 +/- 9.2 post-operatively (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). The VAS score improved from 6.1 +/- 2.3 to 2.0 +/- 1.4 at the last follow-up (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). Twenty-one patients (87.5%) were satisfied with their clinical results. By the last follow-up CT scan, there was bone cyst formation at the donor sites in three patients, at the recipient sites in five patients and at both sites in five patients. Two patients (8.3%) underwent re-operation with arthroscopic debridement because of medial gutter hypertrophic soft tissue impingement. Conclusion OAT harvesting from the ipsilateral talar articular facet showed satisfactory results. The mean post-operative VAS score and AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score improved significantly. Post-operative impingement around the osteotomy site was the main complication and reason for re-operation after the index procedure. In addition, bone cysts at the recipient and/or donor site(s) were found with a large percentage under CT. Therefore, longer follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term clinical results for this technique.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214107,Iron nanoparticle-labeled murine mesenchymal stromal cells in an osteoarthritic model persists and suggests anti-inflammatory mechanism of action,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage degradation and chronic joint inflammation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results in OA, but their mechanism of action is not fully understood. We hypothesize that MSCs polarize macrophages, which are strongly associated with joint inflammation to more homeostatic sub-types. We tracked ferumoxytol (Feraheme™, iron oxide nanoparticle)-labeled murine MSCs (Fe-MSCs) in murine OA joints, and quantified changes to joint inflammation and fibrosis. 10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 5/group) were induced to undergo osteoarthritis by destabilization of medical meniscus (DMM) or sham surgery. 3 weeks post-surgery, mice were injected intra-articularly with either fluorescent dye-(DiR) labeled or DiR-Fe-MSC or saline to yield 4 groups (n = 5 per group for each timepoint [1, 2 and 4weeks]). 4 weeks after injection, mice were imaged by MRI, and scored for i) OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) to determine cartilage damage; ii) immunohistochemical changes in iNOS, CD206, F4/80 and Prussian Blue/Sca-1 to detect pro-inflammatory, homeostatic and total macrophages and ferumoxytol -labeled MSCs respectively, and iii) Masson's Trichrome to detect changes in fibrosis. Ferumoxytol-labeled MSCs persisted at greater levels in DMM vs. SHAM-knee joints. We observed no difference in OARSI scores between MSC and vehicle groups. Sca-1 and Prussian Blue co-staining confirmed the ferumoxytol label resides in MSCs, although some ferumoxytol label was detected in proximity to MSCs in macrophages, likely due to phagocytosis of apoptotic MSCs, increasing functionality of these macrophages through MSC efferocytosis. MRI hypertintensity scores related to fluid edema decreased in MSC-treated vs. control animals. For the first time, we show that MSC-treated mice had increased ratios of %CD206+: %F4/80+ (homeostatic macrophages) (p<0.05), and decreased ratios of %iNOS+: %F4/80+ macrophages (p<0.01), supporting our hypothesis that MSCs may modulate synovial inflammation.",0
https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.916481,Evaluation of an Autologous Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Matrix Scaffold in a Rabbit and Minipig Model of Cartilage Repair,"BACKGROUND:This study aimed to evaluate an autologous bone mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold in two animal models of cartilage repair. MATERIAL AND METHODS:A rabbit model (n=16) and a minipig model (n=8) of cartilage repair were created with cartilage defects of the knee joints treated with bone marrow stimulation (BMS). In the ECM group, autologous bone MSC-derived ECM scaffolds were implanted into the cartilage defects after bone marrow stimulation. In the BMS group, the cartilage defects were treated by bone marrow stimulation only. The renewal capacity of bone MSCs was measured with a colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) in vitro assay. The extent of cartilage repair was as-sessed at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS:In the rabbit model, the macroscopic appearance of the exudate of the healing wounds in the ECM group showed less fibrosis, and the histology showed more evenly distributed chondrocytes compared with the BMS group. The CFU-F assay showed that the number of bone MSCs in the ECM group was approximately was twice that of the BMS group. In the minipig model, the macroscopic appearance and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the ECM group were improved when compared with the BMS group. The repaired tissue in ECM group had similar histological characteristics and biochemical content to normal hyaline cartilage. CONCLUSIONS:In two animal models of knee joint cartilage repair, the use of an ECM scaffold increased the number of bone MSCs and improved the extent of cartilage repair.",0

Hypothesis: A novel graft preservation method combined with surgical technique and patient management improvements would lead to consistently successful outcomes after osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: With institutional review board approval and informed consent, patients were prospectively enrolled into a registry to follow outcomes after OCA transplantation. Patients were included when ≥1-year follow-up data were available, including complications and reoperations, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), compliance with rehabilitation, revisions, and failures. Results: For patients meeting inclusion criteria (N = 194), mean ± SD age was 37.9 ± 12.2 years and mean BMI was 28.9 ± 5; 38% received unipolar transplants (44% multisurface) and 62% received bipolar transplants. OCAs were preserved by standard tissue bank methods (standard preservation [SP]; 29%) or the novel method (Missouri Osteochondral Preservation System [MOPS]; 71%). Initial success rates were 79% for all cases combined, 60% for SP, and 84% for MOPS. MOPS cases were significantly ( P = .028) more likely to be associated with successful outcomes when compared with SP cases. PROMs improved significantly ( P &lt; .05) for all cohorts through 3 to 4 years of follow-up. Revisions were performed in 19 cases (10%). MOPS grafts were associated with a significantly ( P = .0014) lower revision rate (5%) than SP grafts (21%). Failures occurred in 26 patients (13%), with all undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Bipolar cases were significantly ( P = .008) more likely to be associated with failure. MOPS grafts were associated with a significantly ( P = .048) lower failure rate (11%) than were SP grafts (19%). Noncompliance with the prescribed rehabilitation protocol was significantly ( P = .00008) more likely to be associated with failure. Conclusion: Prospective data for 194 cases revealed that OCA transplantation for unipolar, multisurface, and bipolar cartilage restoration can be associated with consistently successful outcomes. The 5% revision rate, 11% failure rate, 82%-94% survival probability estimates, and continually improving PROMs through postoperative 3 to 4 years underscore major advances in outcomes as compared with previous reports. These encouraging results were realized with the use of a novel graft preservation method; autogenous bone marrow concentrate pretreatment of donor bone; advancements in graft cutting, implantation, and stabilization techniques; and procedure-specific rehabilitation protocols.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-018-3916-9,Subchondral stem cell therapy versus contralateral total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis following secondary osteonecrosis of the knee,"PURPOSE: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implanted in patients with secondary osteonecrosis (ON) related to corticosteroids have relatively poor outcome (20% revision rate) at a mean follow-up of only eight years. With the hypothesis that subchondral bone marrow injection might improve knees in these patients, we evaluated 30 patients who had bilateral knee osteoarthritis with severe joint space narrowing and received TKA in one knee and subchondral bone marrow concentrate injection in the contralateral knee. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out in 60 knees of 30 patients (mean age 28 years, 18-41) who presented bilateral osteoarthritis secondary to knee ON related to corticosteroids in relation with different severe medical conditions. During the same anesthesia, one knee received TKA; for the other knee, a bone marrow graft containing an average of 6500 MSCs/mL (counted as CFU-F, range 3420 to 9830) was delivered to the subchondral bone of the femur and tibia. The length of anesthesia related to each procedure (bone marrow aspiration and subchondral injection of concentrated bone marrow versus total knee arthroplasty) was measured. Peri-operative outcomes, morbidity, complications, and safety of the two procedures were compared. Subsequent admissions for revision surgery were identified. At the most recent follow-up (average of 12 years, range 8 to 16 years), clinical outcomes of the patient (Knee Society score) were obtained along with radiological imaging outcomes (MRIs for knees with subchondral bone marrow injection). RESULTS: Anesthesia related to the TKA side was longer than for the cell therapy group. Medical and surgical complications were more frequent after TKA. A higher number of thrombophlebitis was observed on the side with TKA (15%) versus none on the side with cell therapy (0%). At the most recent follow-up (average of 12 years, range 8 to 16 years), six (out of 30) TKA knees needed subsequent surgery versus only one with cell therapy. The Knee Score had improved and remained similar in the TKA and cell therapy groups (respectively 80.3 points ± 11 versus 78.3 ± 23); 21 patients preferred the knee with cell therapy and 9 preferred the knee with TKA. Knees with cell therapy had improvement on cartilage and bone marrow lesions observed at the site of bone marrow subchondral injection. CONCLUSIONS: Subchondral autologous bone marrow concentrate was an effective procedure for treating young patients with knee osteoarthritis following secondary ON of the knee related to corticosteroids with a lower complication rate and a quicker recovery as compared with TKA.",0

In nine of these patients, five MRI examinations were performed at 4, 12, 24, 52 and 104 weeks after HyalograftC implant. The repair tissue was described with separate variables: degree of defect repair in width and length, signal intensity of the repair tissue and status of the subchondral bone. For these variables a grading system with point scale evaluation was applied.High-resolution MRI provides a non-invasive tool for monitoring the development of cartilage repair tissue following HyalograftC technology, shows a good correlation with clinical outcome and may help to differentiate abnormal repair tissue from a normal maturation process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546509350704,Treatment of Full-Thickness Chondral Defects with Hyalograft C in the Knee,"Background Tissue engineering has become available for cartilage repair in clinical practice. Hypothesis The treatment of full-thickness chondral defects in the knee with a hyaluronan-based scaffold seeded with autolo-gous chondrocytes provides stable improvement of clinical outcome up to 7 years. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Fifty-three patients with deep osteochondral defects in the knee were treated with Hyalograft C. The mean age at implantation was 32 6 12 years, the mean defect size was 4.4 6 1.9 cm2, and the mean body mass index was 24.5 6 3.8 kg/m2. Implantations were performed with miniarthrotomy or arthroscopy. The primary indications for implantation with Hyalograft C included young patients with a stable joint, normal knee alignment, and isolated chondral defects with otherwise healthy adjacent cartilage. The secondary indications were patients who did not meet the primary indication criteria or were salvage procedures. Forty-two patients with primary indications and 11 patients with secondary indications were evaluated. Outcome was evaluated with the International Cartilage Repair Society and International Knee Documentation Committee scales, the Lysholm score, the modified Cincinnati score, and with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Statistical analysis consisted of bivariate correlation analysis and unpaired, 2-tailed t tests. Results A highly significant increase (P&lt;001) in all knee scores was found in patients treated for the primary indications. Nine of 11 secondary indication cases underwent total knee arthroplasty due to persisting pain between 2 and 5 years after implantation. Graft failure occurred in 3 of 42 patients with primary indication between 6 months and 5 years after implantation. Kaplan-Meier survival demonstrated significantly different chances for survival between primary and secondary outcome and between simple, complex, and salvage cases, respectively (P &lt;.001). Conclusion Hyalograft C autograft provides clinical improvement in healthy young patients with single cartilage defects. Less complicated surgery and lower morbidity are considered advantages of the technique. The results of treatment with Hyalograft C as a salvage procedure or in patients with osteoarthritis are poor.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/1983025,Evaluation of the Curative Effect of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Knee Arthritis in Dogs Using Imaging Technology,"The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of canine umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) on the treatment of knee osteoarthritis in dogs.Eight dogs were evenly assigned to two groups. The canine model of knee osteoarthritis was established by surgical manipulation of knee articular cartilage on these eight dogs. UC-MSCs were isolated from umbilical cord Wharton's jelly by 0.1% type collagenase I and identified by immunofluorescence staining and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. A suspension of allogeneic UC-MSCs (1 × 106) and an equal amount of physiological saline was injected into the cavitas articularis in the treated and untreated control groups, respectively, on days 1 and 3 posttreatment. The structure of the canine knee joint was observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), B-mode ultrasonography, and X-ray imaging at the 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 28th days after treatment. Concurrently, the levels of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α in the blood of the examined dogs were measured. Moreover, the recovery of cartilage and patella surface in the treated group and untreated group was compared using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) after a 35-day treatment.Results revealed that the isolated cells were UC-MSCs, because they were positive for CD44 and negative for CD34 surface markers, and the cells were differentiated into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Imaging technology showed that as treatment time increased, the high signal in the MRI T2-weighted images decreased, the echo-free space in B ultrasonography images disappeared basically, and the continuous linear hypoechoic region at the trochlear sulcus thickened. On X-ray images, the serrate defect at the ventral cortex of the patella improved, and the low-density gap of the ventral patella and trochlear crest gradually increased in the treated group. On the contrary, the high signal in the MRI T2-weighted images and the echo-free space in B ultrasonography images still increased after a 14-day treatment in the untreated control group, and the linear hypoechoic region was discontinuous. On the X-ray images, there was no improvement in the serrate defect of the ventral cortex of the patella. Results for inflammatory factors showed that the blood levels of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α of the untreated control group were significantly higher than those of the treated group (P < 0.05) 7-14 days posttreatment. The result of SEM showed that the cartilage neogenesis in the treated group had visible neonatal tissue and more irregular arrangement of new tissue fibers than that of the untreated control group. Furthermore, more vacuoles but without collagen fibers were observed in the cartilage of the untreated control group, and the thickness of the neogenetic cartilage in the treated group (65.13 ± 5.29, 65.30 ± 5.83) and the untreated control group (34.27 ± 5.42) showed a significant difference (P < 0.01).Significantly higher improvement in cartilage neogenesis and recovery was observed in the treated group compared to the untreated control group. The joint fluid and the inflammatory response in the treated group decreased. Moreover, improved recovery in the neogenetic cartilage, damaged skin fascia, and muscle tissue around the joints was more significant in the treated group than in the untreated control group. In conclusion, canine UC-MSCs promote the repair of cartilage and patella injury in osteoarthritis, improve the healing of the surrounding tissues, and reduce the inflammatory response.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-009-0828-7,Cell quality affects clinical outcome after MACI procedure for cartilage injury of the knee,"The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that in early follow up after matrix guided autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI), clinical results do not correlate with radiological and histological results, and that MACI as first line procedure and treatment of traumatic cartilage defects leads to better results compared to second line treatment and treatment of degenerative defects. Six and twelve months after MACI, patients IKDC-score was analysed, as well as the results of MRI-examinations. Specimens of the scaffold were histologically assessed at the time of implantation. The IKDC-score as well as the MRI-score improved significantly during follow up. The number of morphological abnormal cells was correlated with a poor clinical outcome. Defect aetiology proved to be a decisive factor for good clinical outcome. Patients with a short history of trauma (\textbackslashtextless 1 year) and an osteochondritis dissecans were found to have better scores 1 year after MACI than patients with a trauma more than 1 year ago. Defect-size, patients age and -gender did not significantly influence the clinical outcome. No differences were seen when MACI was used as first- or second-line procedure. Defect aetiology and quality of the cells are decisive for the clinical outcome. MACI can produce good and very good clinical results even when used as second-line procedure.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.20775,Effect of risedronate in a minipig cartilage defect model with allograft,"Cartilage/chondrocyte transplantation is frequently utilized in the repair of focal chondral defects. It has been proposed that failure of subchondral bone maintenance or restoration is a factor contributing to the failure of cartilage-forming transplants. Some studies reveal that the transplant is associated with subchondral bone resorption, often leading to deep pits beneath the presumptive cartilage repair site. Thus, the question is raised as to the utility of agents, such as bisphosphonates, to inhibit bone remodeling at the transplant site. In the present study we show that oral administration (three times weekly) of the bisphosphonate, risedronate, inhibited the subchondral bone loss deep to the cultured allogeneic graft tissue site in attempted repair of surgically created chondral defects in a minipig model. In addition, the graft tissue, characterized by type II collagen, was retained in the majority of treated animals. Untreated minipigs displayed a deep bone resorption pit, beneath the graft region, filled with type I collagen tissue as determined through immunohistochemical staining. This fibrous tissue appeared well integrated with the host tissue in the majority of cases. In the transplanted cartilage region, the overall histological score for tissue quality was significantly (p < 0.05) better for the treated animals which displayed better matrix staining, cell clustering, tidemark integrity, and subchondral bone integrity (p < 0.05 in each category). However, the integration of allograft with host tissue did not always occur completely. Thus, bisphosphonates might be considered in clinical treatment strategies for such procedures.",0

Il s’agit d’une étude prospective, avec validation par un comité d’éthique et consentement éclairé des patients. Vingt-huit patients d’âge moyen 28 ans ont été opérés dans 7 hôpitaux. Les étiologies étaient : ostéochondrites, 14 cas ; chondropathies post-traumatiques isolées, 8 cas ; chondropathies et rupture du LCA, 6 cas. Toutes les lésions concernaient les condyles et étaient profondes (grades 3 et 4 de l’ICRS). La surface moyenne après débridement lésionnel était de 490 mm 2 (150 à 1050 mm 2 ). Les patients ont été suivis au recul minimum de 2 ans post-greffe avec un bilan fonctionnel, une IRM, une arthroscopie de contrôle avec biopsie (histologie et immunohistochimie). Vingt-six patients ont été évalués à plus de 2 ans. Il n’y a eu aucune complication générale, 3 patients ont eu une avulsion partielle de la greffe traitée par arthroscopie et un a fait l’objet d’une arthrolyse à 6 mois. Tous les patients sauf 4 s’estimaient très nettement améliorés fonctionnellement, un seul est resté douloureux. Le score de l’ICRS est passé de 41 points (19 à 55) à 74 points (54 à 86) soit un gain de 80 %. Seize IRM ont été réalisées, la greffe était hypertrophique dans 11 cas, de niveau dans 3 cas et insuffisante dans 2 cas ; l’intégration marginale était bonne dans 11 cas et partielle dans 5 cas ; l’intégration sous-chondrale était complète dans 10 cas et médiocre dans 6 cas. Le score arthroscopique était presque normal (de 8 à 11) dans 8 cas et anormal (de 4 à 7) dans 5 cas. Les histologies ont été classées en 4 groupes selon la richesse en cartilage hyalin : groupe 1(> 60 % de cartilage hyalin) 1 cas, groupe 2 (> 40 %) 3 cas, groupe 3 (< 40 %) 4 cas et groupe 4 (tissu osseux ou fibreux) 1 cas. Les scores fonctionnels (r = 0,80) et les scores IRM (r = 0,76) sont corrélés aux scores arthroscopiques. Les résultats cliniques démontrent une amélioration dans plus de 80 % des cas, ce qui est similaire aux séries des promoteurs de la méthode. Les résultats arthroscopiques et histologiques sont équivalents à ceux de Knutsen, mais inférieurs à ceux de Bentley ou Peterson. The knee has little capacity for spontaneous regeneration of deep cartilage defects. In 1999, the French Society of Arthroscopy initiated a multicentric clinical trial on autologous chondrocyte transplantation using the technique described by Brittberg and Peterson. The protocol of this prospective study was validated by the ethics committee and all patients provided the informed consent for participation. Patients underwent surgery in seven hospitals: 28 patients (7 female, 21 male, mean age 28 years, age range 18-45 years). The underlying condition was: osteochondritis (n=14), isolated posttraumatic chondropathy (n=8), chondropathy plus ACL tear (n=6). All patients presented deep condylar cartilage defects (ICRS grades 3 and 4). Mean surface area involved after debridement was 490 mm 2 (range 150-1050 mm 2 ). Patients were reviewed two years at least after transplantation for functional assessment and an MRI performed 2 to 3 years after transplantation. Control arthroscopy was also performed in 13 patients with biopsy for histology and immunohistochemistry for 10. Twenty-six patients were reviewed with more than two years follow-up (mean 2 years 9 months). There were no general complications; three patients presented a partial avulsion of the autograft treated arthroscopically and one arthrolysis was performed at six months. Function was improved in all patients but four, but pain persisted in one patient. The mean ICRS score improved from 41 points (19-55 points) to 74 points (54-86 points), for an 80% gain. Follow-up MRI was available for 16 knees: the graft was hypertrophied in 11, at level in 3 and insufficient in 2; marginal integration was good in 10 knees and fair in 6. Items of marginal and subchondral integration had a very high positive predictive value for good clinical outcome. The arthroscopic score was nearly normal (range 8-11) in 8 knees and abnormal (range 4-7) in 5. The Knutsen histological groups according to richness of hyaline cartilage were: group 1 (>60%) (n=1); group 2 (>40%) (n=3), group 3 (<40%) n(=4) and group 4 (bone or fibrous tissue) (n=1). The function scores (r=0.80) and the MRI scores (r=0.76) were correlated with the arthroscopy scores. There was no correlation between the histological findings but the sample size was too small for meaningful analysis. The clinical results demonstrate an improvement in more than 80% of knees, findings similar to earlier reports. The arthroscopic and histological results were equivalent to those reported by Knutsen, but less satisfactory than those reported by Bentley or Peterson. Cell injections under a periosteal patch constitute the first generation of autologous chondrocyte grafts. Resorbable matrices loaded with chondrocytes before implantation are under development and have provided promising early results.",0

Storage temperature and nutrient medium composition are the most critical factors for sustained biological activity of grafts before implantation. In this study, we performed a time-dependent in vitro experiment to investigate the effect of various storage conditions on electromechanical, histological and histochemical properties of articular cartilage.Osteochondral grafts derived from goat femoral condyles were frozen at -70 °C or stored at 4 °C and 37 °C in the medium supplemented with or without insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). After 14 and 28 days the cartilage samples were quantitatively analysed for electromechanical properties, glycosaminoglycan distribution, histological structure, chondrocyte viability and apoptosis. The results were compared between the experimental groups and correlations among different evaluation methods were determined.Storage at -70 °C and 37 °C significantly deteriorated cartilage electromechanical, histological and histochemical properties. Storage at 4 °C maintained the electromechanical quantitative parameter (QP) and glycosaminoglycan expression near the normal levels for 14 days. Although hypothermic storage revealed reduced chondrocyte viability and increased apoptosis, these parameters were superior compared with the storage at -70 °C and 37 °C. IGF-1 supplementation improved the electromechanical QP, chondrocyte viability and histological properties at 37 °C, but the effect lasted only 14 days. Electromechanical properties correlated with the histological grading score (r = 0.673, p < 0.001), chondrocyte viability (r = -0.654, p < 0.001) and apoptosis (r = 0.416, p < 0.02). In addition, apoptosis correlated with glycosaminoglycan distribution (r = -0.644, p < 0.001) and the histological grading score (r = 0.493, p = 0.006).Our results indicate that quality of allografts is better preserved at currently established 4 °C storage temperature. Storage at -70 °C or at 37 °C is unable to maintain cartilage function and metabolic activity. IGF-1 supplementation at 37 °C can enhance chondrocyte viability and improve electromechanical and histological properties of the cartilage, but the impact persists only 14 days. The correlations between cartilage electromechanical quantitative parameter (QP) and metabolic activity were detected. Our findings indicate that non-destructive assessment of cartilage by Arthro-BST is a simple and reliable method to evaluate allograft quality, and could be routinely used before implantation.",0

However, the menisci have limited healing potential due to the paucity of vascularity . The purpose of the present study was to test the feasibility of a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to repair incurable meniscal lesions. Porcine synovial MSCs were cultured in monolayers at high density in the presence of ascorbic acid followed by the suspension culture to develop a three-dimensional cell/matrix construct (TEC). A 4-mm cylindrical defect was created bilaterally in the medial meniscus of skeletally mature miniature pigs . The defects were implanted with an allogenic TEC or were left empty. After 6 months, the TEC-treated defects were consistently repaired by a fibro-cartilaginous tissue with good tissue integration to the adjacent host meniscal tissue, while the untreated were either partially or not repaired. The ratio of Safranin O positive area within the central body of the meniscus adjacent to the original defect was significantly higher in the TEC-treated group than in the control group. Moreover, TEC treatment significantly reduced the size and severity of post-traumatic chondral lesions on the tibial plateau. These results suggest that the TEC could be a promising stem cell-based implant to repair meniscal lesions with preventive effects from meniscal body degeneration and the development of post-traumatic arthritis.",0
,[Double-sided juvenile osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle in a 15-year-old boy].,"A 15-year-old boy of Turkish origin presented with a painful swollen left knee. An X-ray revealed osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle. Arthrotomy was performed and the fragment was fixated with tissue glue and 2 absorbable pins. Eight months later, a large recurrent osteochondral fragment of the lateral femoral condyle was seen on X-ray. The patient was re-operated, during which operation the fragment was found and fixated with three compression screws. One year after the first operation the patient developed similar complaints in the contralateral knee; this knee also contained osteochondral fragments necessitating surgery. Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee is a multifactorial disease in which part of the cartilage of the femoral condyle becomes unattached from the subchondral stratum, usually on the lateral side of the medial femoral condyle. Initially, an inflammatory reaction was thought to be the cause of osteochondritis dissecans. Because of the lack of white blood cells, a previous trauma is a better explanation for the ultimate loosening of the cartilage. The treatments that are described for osteochondritis dissecans are conservative treatment, operative fixation, with or without subsequent chondrocyte transplantation or osteochondral autograft transplantation, and finally microfracturing.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/272481,Evolution of Autologous Chondrocyte Repair and Comparison to Other Cartilage Repair Techniques,"Articular cartilage defects have been addressed using microfracture, abrasion chondroplasty, or osteochondral grafting, but these strategies do not generate tissue that adequately recapitulates native cartilage. During the past 25 years, promising new strategies using assorted scaffolds and cell sources to induce chondrocyte expansion have emerged. We reviewed the evolution of autologous chondrocyte implantation and compared it to other cartilage repair techniques. Methods . We searched PubMed from 1949 to 2014 for the keywords “autologous chondrocyte implantation” (ACI) and “cartilage repair” in clinical trials, meta-analyses, and review articles. We analyzed these articles, their bibliographies, our experience, and cartilage regeneration textbooks. Results . Microfracture, abrasion chondroplasty, osteochondral grafting, ACI, and autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis are distinguishable by cell source (including chondrocytes and stem cells) and associated scaffolds (natural or synthetic, hydrogels or membranes). ACI seems to be as good as, if not better than, microfracture for repairing large chondral defects in a young patient’s knee as evaluated by multiple clinical indices and the quality of regenerated tissue. Conclusion . Although there is not enough evidence to determine the best repair technique, ACI is the most established cell-based treatment for full-thickness chondral defects in young patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546510392711,Novel Nano-composite Multilayered Biomaterial for Osteochondral Regeneration,"Background: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in and awareness of the importance of subchondral bone, for its role in the pathogenesis of articular surface damage and for the care that should be taken when treating such damage. Purpose: The objective of this pilot clinical study was to test the safety and performance of a newly developed type I collagen-hydroxyapatite nanostructured biomimetic osteochondral scaffold that aims to regenerate cartilage and subchondral bone. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A multilayer gradient nano-composite scaffold was obtained by nucleating collagen type I fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. Thirty patients (9 female, 21 male; mean age, 29.3 years) with knee chondral or osteochondral lesions were treated with scaffold implantation. Lesion size varied from 1.5 cm 2 to 6.0 cm 2 . Twenty-eight patients were followed for 2 years and were clinically evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee and Tegner scores. At final follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging evaluation was performed in 24 patients, and they were evaluated with the MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) score. Results: The Tegner and International Knee Documentation Committee objective and subjective scores improved significantly from the baseline evaluation to the 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. Further analysis showed a slower recovery but the same results for patients who presented with adverse events, for older patients, for patients who underwent previous surgery, and for those with patellar lesions. In contrast, a faster recovery was observed in active patients. At magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, complete filling of the cartilage and complete integration of the graft was shown in 70% of the lesions. However, the subchondral lamina and bone were considered intact in a minority of cases (7% and 47%, respectively). Conclusion: This open 1-step procedure was used for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral knee defects. The present pilot study highlighted the safety and potential clinical benefit of the graded biomimetic osteochondral scaffold in promoting bone and cartilage tissue restoration by itself and with good clinical and magnetic resonance imaging results at the 2-year follow-up.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-010-0057-2,Comparison of two different matrix-based autologous chondrocyte transplantation systems: 1 year follow-up results,"Purpose The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee is a common problem in orthopaedic surgery. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is one of the few reliable treatment options of cartilage defects with good long-term outcomes. The improvement of ACT led to the matrix-based ACT (MACT). The purpose of the study was to compare two different commercially available MACT systems. Methods Eleven patients with a cartilage defect of the knee were treated with the MACI(A (R)) system and another nine patients with the CaRes(A (R)) implant. The patients were prospectively followed and re-examined after one year. Results One year after surgery all but one patient have significantly improved in their clinical outcome. Both types of MACT revealed similar results in terms of increase in level of activity, pain relief and knee function. Conclusion The study showed that MACT is a good therapeutic option for full-size defects of the femoral condyle. The MACI(A (R)) implant seems to be easier to handle which is reflected by smaller incisions and a shorter operation time.",1

Purpose: To evaluate clinical outcomes after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for the treatment of bipolar chondral lesions in the TF compartment. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We evaluated 57 patients who underwent ACI for the treatment of symptomatic bipolar chondral lesions in the TF compartment by a single surgeon between October 1995 and June 2014. One patient did not return for follow-up. Thus, 56 patients (58 knees) were included with a minimum of 2 years’ follow-up. A mean of 3.1 lesions per knee were treated, representing a mean total surface area of 16.1 cm 2 (range, 3.2-44.5 cm 2 ) per knee. Bipolar lesions were present in the medial compartment (32 knees) and in the lateral compartment (26 knees). Patients were evaluated with the modified Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale, visual analog scale for pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and Short Form–36. Patients also answered questions regarding self-rated knee function and satisfaction with the procedure. Standard radiographs were evaluated with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. Results: The survival rate was 80% at 5 years and 76% at 10 years. A significantly better survival rate was found in patients with the use of a collagen membrane than periosteum (97% vs 61% at 5 years, respectively; P = .0014). Of 46 knees with retained grafts, all functional scores significantly improved postoperatively, with a very high satisfaction rate (91%) at a mean of 8.3 ± 5.1 years (range, 2-20 years) after ACI. At last follow-up, 24 of 46 successful knees were radiographically assessed (mean, 5.5 ± 4.0 years [range, 2.0-18.7 years]) and showed no significant osteoarthritis progression ( P = .3173). Outcomes for 12 patients were considered as failures at a mean of 4.1 years. Of these, 9 patients were converted to partial or total knee arthroplasty at a mean of 4.4 years. Two patients underwent revision ACI at 5 and 17 months. The other 1 patient did not require revision surgery. Conclusion: Our study showed that ACI for the treatment of bipolar chondral lesions in the TF compartment provided successful clinical outcomes in patients with retained grafts and possibly prevented or delayed osteoarthritis progression at midterm to long-term follow-up. A collagen membrane is more encouraging than periosteum for bipolar lesions in the TF compartment. While addressing the predisposing factors affecting cartilage repair, ACI could be an adequate salvage procedure for bipolar chondral lesions in the TF compartment for the relatively young arthritic patient who wishes to avoid arthroplasty.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546518793405,Clinical Outcomes of Multifocal Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation of the Knee: An Analysis of Overlapping Grafts and Multifocal Lesions,"Background: There is a paucity of literature regarding the outcomes of adjacent-plug osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) for irregular or ovoid lesions and multifocal OCA for multicompartmental, focal lesions. Purpose: To quantify the survival of multiplug OCA for larger, high-grade chondral lesions with the “snowman” technique versus that of multicompartmental or bipolar OCA. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: All patients who underwent primary, multiplug OCA for large unicondylar, multicompartmental (eg, bipolar patellofemoral and condylar, bicondylar), or bipolar chondral defects (ie, patellofemoral) with a minimum 2-year follow-up by a single surgeon from April 1, 2003, to April 1, 2015, were analyzed. Failure was defined as revision OCA, conversion to arthroplasty, or gross appearance of graft degeneration on second-look arthroscopic surgery. Results: Twenty-six patients (28 knees) were identified, with 22 patients (24 knees; 50% female; mean age, 31.9 ± 9.1 years) having at least 2-year clinical follow-up (85.7%). Nine patients (9 knees) underwent isolated, condylar OCA with the snowman technique and had a mean follow-up of 7.4 ± 3.6 years (range, 1.38-11.14 years), while 13 additional patients (15 knees) underwent multifocal OCA and had a mean follow-up of 6.4 ± 3.9 years (range, 2.07-12.38 years). Reoperations were common, with 44.4% (n = 4) of the snowman group and 20.0% (n = 3) of the multifocal group undergoing at least 1 reoperation. There were 3 failures (33.3%) in the snowman group at a mean 7.7 ± 5.5 years and 1 failure (6.7%) in the multifocal group at 4.5 ± 0.0 years, with all undergoing secondary total knee arthroplasty. Patients who underwent snowman OCA demonstrated significant postoperative improvement in the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscore and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) overall score ( P &lt; .05 for both). Patients who underwent multifocal OCA demonstrated significant improvement in the International Knee Documentation Committee score; KOOS symptoms, activities of daily living, sport, and quality of life subscores; WOMAC stiffness, function, and overall subscores; and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey physical component summary score ( P &lt; .05 for all). Conclusion: Patients who underwent unicondylar, multiplug OCA using the snowman technique demonstrated inferior clinical outcomes, higher reoperation rates, and greater failure rates than those who underwent isolated single-graft transplantation. By contrast, multifocal OCA may be a viable knee preservation technique for young, active patients with multicompartmental chondral disease, leading to improved clinical outcomes and low reoperation and failure rates at midterm follow-up.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s001670100200,Autologous chondrocyte implantation: cells phenotype and proliferation analysis,"The phenotype and proliferation of human chondrocytes in culture were analyzed before they were implanted as autologous graft in cartilage lesions. During ten autologous chondrocyte implantations in articular cartilage lesions of the knee in ten patients, small amounts of cells to be implanted were collected and analyzed by morphology, cytochemistry (alcian blue, safranin-O), and immunocytochemistry (antibodies anti-S100 protein, anti-collagen types I and II, anti-chondroitin-S). In four cases the cells were also cultured for 3 weeks. At 1, 10, and 20 days of culture cells were incubated with 1 mu Ci/ml [H-3]thymidine for proliferation analysis. In all cases the cells showed the morphological appearance of mature chondrocytes, stained positively for alcian blue and safranin-O, and revealed a strong immunoreaction for S-100 protein, type II collagen, and chondroitin-S but not for type I collagen. Radioisotope assay of chondrocyte proliferation at 1, 10, and 20 days of culture revealed a progressive increase in [H-3]thymidine. incorporation. These findings indicate that the cells before autologous implantation maintain their differentiated phenotype of mature chondrocytes, and proliferate greatly. This analysis is an essential step preceding wider use of this treatment in humans. However, other biological aspects of the autologous, chondrocyte graft remain to be elucidated.",0

Purpose This study was conducted to assess the clinical efficacy, including biomechanical analyses, of BioSeed-C treatment for traumatic and degenerative cartilage defects of the knee. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods The authors evaluated the midterm clinical and biomechanical outcome of BioSeed-C, a cell-based fibrin-polymer graft for the treatment of cartilage defects. Clinical outcome at 4-year follow-up was assessed in 52 patients with full-thickness cartilage defects, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) stage III and IV. Clinical scoring was performed preoperatively and 48 months after implantation using the Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the ICRS score, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the Noyes score. Cartilage regeneration was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the Henderson-Kreuz score. Biomechanical evaluation was performed by isokinetic strength measurements, comparing healthy and operated knee of each patient. Results Clinical evaluation showed significant improvement in the Lysholm (from 51.8 preoperatively to 80.7 at 48 months postoperatively), IKDC (from 47.5 to 71.5), ICRS (from 3.8 to 2.0), KOOS (subcategory pain from 62 to 78, symptoms from 68 to 76, activities of daily living from 68 to 85, sports from 19 to 55, and quality of life from 30 to 55), and Noyes (from 31 to 59) scores ( P ≤ .001) 48 months after implantation of BioSeed-C compared with the preoperative situation. The MRI evaluations showed moderate to complete defect filling in 43 of 44 treated patients. Two patients without improvement in the clinical and MRI scores received a total knee endoprosthesis after 4 years. Isokinetic evaluation showed significantly reduced maximum strength capacities for knee flexion and extension at the operated knee compared with the healthy knee ( P &lt; .05). Conclusion The clinical outcomes 4 years after graft implantation are good despite a persisting strength deficit. Implanting Bio-Seed-C is a promising treatment option for cartilage defects of the knee. More emphasis should be put on the rehabilitation of muscular strength.",0
https://doi.org/10.1243/09544119jeim188,In-situ engineering of cartilage repair: a pre-clinical in-vivo exploration of a novel system,"This investigation explores a new cartilage repair technique that uses a novel method to secure a non-woven multifilamentous scaffold in the defect site after microfracture. The hypothesis is that a scaffold provides a larger surface area for attachment and proliferation of the mesenchymal stem cells that migrate from the bone marrow. Two in-vivo studies were undertaken in an ovine model. The first study, which lasted for 8 weeks, aimed to compare the new technique with microfracture. Chondral defects, 7 mm in diameter, were created in both femoral medial condyles of five ewes. One defect was treated with the new technique while the contralateral knee was treated with microfracture alone. The results revealed that the quantity of repair tissue was significantly greater in the defects treated with the new system. The second study had two time points, 3 and 6 months, and used 13 ewes. In this study, both defects were treated with the new technique but one received additional subchondral drilling in order to stimulate extra tissue growth. The majority of the implants had good tissue induction, filling 50-100 per cent of the defect volume, while the compressive modulus of the repairs was in the range of 40-70 per cent of that for the surrounding cartilage. In addition, hyaline-like cartilage was seen in all the repairs which had the additional drilling of the subchondral bone.",0
,[Experimental research of articular cartilage defect repair using micro-fracture and insulin-like growth factor 1 in rabbits].,"To investigate the effects of micro-fracture and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in treatment of articular cartilage defect in rabbits.Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits (aged, 4-6 months; weighing, 2.5-3.5 kg) were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 6): micro-fractures and recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) treatment group (group A), micro-fracture control group (group B), rhIGF-1 treatment control group (group C), and blank control group (group D). Full thickness articular cartilage defects of 8 mm x 6 mm in size were created in the bilateral femoral condyles of all rabbits. The micro-fracture surgery was performed in groups A and B. The 0.1 mL rhIGF-1 (0.01 microg/microL) was injected into the knee cavity in groups A and C at 3 times a week for 4 weeks after operation, while 0.1 mL saline was injected in groups B and D at the same time points. At 4, 12, and 24 weeks, the gross, histological, and immunohistochemical observations were performed, and histological score also was processed according to Wakitani's score criteria. The collagen contents in the repair tissues and normal patellofemoral cartilage were detected by the improved hydroxyproline (HPR) method at 24 weeks. Electron microscope was used to observe repair tissues of groups A and B at 24 weeks.All animals were survival at the end of experiment. At 24 weeks after operation, defect was repaired with time, and the repair tissue was similar to normal cartilage in group A; the repair tissue was even without boundary with normal cartilage in group B; and the repair tissue was uneven with clear boundary with normal cartilage in groups C and D. Histological staining showed that the repair tissues had no difference with normal cartilage in group A; many oval chondrocytes-like cells and light-colored matrix were seen in the repair tissues of group B; only a few small spindle-shaped fibroblasts were seen in groups C and D. Moreover, histological scores of group A were significantly better than those of groups B, C, and D (P < 0.05) at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Electron microscope observation showed that a large number of lacuna were seen on the surface of repair tissue in group A, and chondrocytes contained glycogen granules were located in lacunae, and were surrounded with the collagen fibers, which was better than that in group B. Collagen content of the repair tissue in group A was significantly higher than that in groups B, C, and D (P < 0.05), but it was significantly lower than that of normal cartilage (P < 0.05).Combination of micro-fracture and rhIGF-1 for the treatment of full thickness articular cartilage defects could promote the repair of defects by hyaline cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-010-1050-3,Autologous chondrocyte implantation for the treatment of cartilage lesions of the knee: a systematic review of randomized studies,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) techniques are becoming more popular for the treatment of full thickness cartilage lesions of the knee joint. However, there is no systematic information for the efficacy of the new generation ACI techniques compared to other treatment options. A systematic review of the existing evidence from randomized clinical trials of ACI treatment would contribute to understanding the advantages and limitations of this method and would inform the planning of future studies. Using pre-defined criteria, we searched a number of electronic databases to identify all the existing randomized control trials of any type of ACI treatment. Risk of bias was assessed and an analysis of the reported outcomes was performed. Information on the clinical efficacy and safety of ACI compared to other interventions was collected and presented. Nine trials were identified with 626 patients. Patients ranged from 15 to 52 years, and the size of treated lesions was between 1 and 22 cm(2). ACI was associated with improvement in clinical outcomes compared to baseline. However, the body of evidence did not suggest any superiority of ACI over other treatments. Complication rates were comparable between interventions except from an increased rate of graft hypertrophies after ACI with periosteum. ACI is an effective treatment for full thickness chondral defects of the knee, providing an improvement of clinical outcomes. However, there is insufficient data to say whether ACI is superior to other treatment strategies. More high quality studies and harmonization in the reported outcomes are needed before specific suggestions for practice can be made.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.10112,Behavior of graft and host cells in underlying subchondral bone after transplantation of osteochondral autograft,"Transplantation of osteochondral autograft is widely used as a therapeutic strategy for the defect of articular cartilage. In the repair process, although underlying subchondral bone becomes necrotic and then is followed by bone reconstruction, the fate of graft and host cells during remodeling of underlying subchondral bone has not been elucidated. The objectives of this study were to establish a method to follow graft and host cells after transplantation of osteochondral autograft, and to elucidate the fate of both graft and host cells during remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. For these purposes, autologous transplantation models employing transgenic rats and wild-type rats, which were genetically identical to each other except for transgenes, were used. Two transplantation models were designed so that either the graft or the host cells had transgenes. Model I: transgenic rats were the donor, and wild-type rats were the recipient; model II: conversely, wild-type rats were the donor, and transgenic rats were the recipient. The grafted bone marrow cells and osteocytes in the trabeculae survived in the graft at 3 weeks after transplantation. Invasion of the host bone marrow cells into the graft was also found. Thus, bone marrow cells in the host as well as both bone marrow cells and osteocytes in the graft could potentially participate in the remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. Furthermore, the interface between graft and host was consisted with both graft and host derived cells. Since new bone formation was found in this space, both graft and host cells could have the potential to contribute to remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. The two models of the transplantations using the transgenic rats were found to be beneficial in following graft cells as well as host cells and in understanding their function on healing after autologous transplantation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620x.91b8.21824,An overview of autologous chondrocyte implantation,"Chondral damage to the knee is common and, if left untreated, can proceed to degenerative osteoarthritis. In symptomatic patients established methods of management rely on the formation of fibrocartilage which has poor resistance to shear forces. The formation of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage may be induced by implanting autologous, cultured chondrocytes into the chondral or osteochondral defect. Autologous chondrocyte implantation may be used for full-thickness chondral or osteochondral injuries which are painful and debilitating with the aim of replacing damaged cartilage with hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage, leading to improved function. The intermediate and long-term functional and clinical results are promising. We provide a review of autologous chondrocyte implantation and describe our experience with the technique at our institution with a mean follow-up of 32 months (1 to 9 years). The procedure is shown to offer statistically significant improvement with advantages over other methods of management of chondral defects.",0

We have investigated the first case series of combined neutralising high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and Matrix-induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI) with MRI. Treatment goals were clinical improvement and delay of arthroplasty.Between 2002 and 2005 18 patients (Mean age 47 years) underwent surgery. Exclusion criteria were lateral compartment and advanced patellofemoral OA. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), six minute walk test (6MWT) and a validated MRI score were outcome measures.There were significant improvements (p<0.05) in all five KOOS domains. Four were significantly maintained to 5 years. The domain ""symptoms"" and results in the 6MWT dropped off at 5 years. MRI results were first significantly improved (24/12) but declined at 60 months. Good quality infill was found in 33% patients at the study endpoint (n=5/15). Histological investigation of one knee demonstrated full-thickness hyaline-like cartilage (20/12). After 2 early failures and one graft detachment graft fixation was changed (Smart nails instead of sutures in 14 cases). Graft hypertrophy requiring a chondroplasty occurred once. There were no other major complications. Specific minor complications included patellar tendinitis (n=8).This combined procedure provides a safe treatment option for younger patients with medial knee OA and varus alignment with significant clinical improvement at 5 years. However, overall graft survival and cartilage infill were poor. Larger studies are needed to statistically verify predictors for longer term cartilage repair in these patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/bco.0b013e328305bdee,Osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow,"Purpose of review Treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow remains challenging. Recently, several techniques for resurfacing a cartilaginous lesion with hyaline cartilage have been developed and applied to osteochondritis dissecans lesions. In this review, we mainly focus on the development of surgical management for osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow over the past year. Recent findings The surgical strategy for osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum (capitellar osteochondritis dissecans) has tended to shift from marrow-stimulating techniques to autologous osteochondral grafts as a cartilage-resurfacing technique. Osteochondral grafts for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans provide better outcomes than simple excision. Regarding the postoperative morbidity of the donor knee, no adverse effect on the donor site is found in young athletes with capitellar osteochondritis dissecans. Additionally, arthroscopic surgery for osteochondritis dissecans lesions has been expanded as well as for other elbow disorders. However, there has been no evidence that arthroscopic surgery for osteochondritis dissecans lesions results in any better prognosis for the patient. Summary The goal of treatment for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans is to return patients to their previous level of sport activities and to regenerate long-lasting hyaline cartilage tissue to replace cartilaginous lesions. For this treatment goal, an arthroscopic cartilage-resurfacing procedure may be an ideal treatment for capitellar osteochondritis dissecans.",0

To overcome this problem, various techniques have been developed and widely used, but the cost-effectiveness and resulting tissue regeneration have never achieved hyaline-like cartilage that has the best biomechanical properties. The idea of this experiment is to use a Biodegradable Porous Sponge Cartilage (BPSC) Scaffold to enhance the regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage combined with microfracture technique and Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ASCs) or secretome on an animal model. Methods A model defect was made on the femoral trochlea of a New Zealand white rabbit. Four groups were made to compare different treatment methods for osteochondral defects. The groups were: (1) Control group; (2) Scaffold Group; (3) Scaffold + ASCs Group; (4) Scaffold + Secretome Group. After 12 weeks, we terminate the animal models, then a macroscopic evaluation using the International Cartilage Research Society (ICRS) scoring system and Oswestry Arthroscopy Score (OAS) was done, followed by sectioning the specimen for microscopic evaluation using the O’Driscoll scoring system. Results The mean score for all treatment group were better compared to the control group grossly and histologically. The best mean score for macroscopic and microscopic evaluation was the group given Scaffold + ASCs. Conclusion The application of BPSC scaffold enhances cartilage regeneration in larger osteochondral defects. Furthermore, the addition of ASCs or secretome along with the scaffold implantation further enhances the cartilage regeneration, in which ASCs shows better results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00132-008-1210-z,[Autologous chondrocyte transplantation in the ankle joint. Rational or irrational?].,"Ankle sprains are one the most common injuries of the lower limb. Fractures, ligamentous lesions, and cartilaginous damage are often associated. Nevertheless the injury is often misjudged and concomitant chondral lesions are assessed late. In the case of a symptomatic osteocartilaginous lesion of the talus, which can be illustrated by MRI or X-ray, operative intervention is indicated. Methods such as microfracturing, mosaicplasty, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) are in clinical use. The latter is well known and being established as the treatment of choice for large cartilage defects in the knee. Due to the good results in the knee and the technological improvements (three-dimensional tissue constructs seeded with autologous chondrocytes) this method is being increasingly applied for cartilage lesions of the talus. In contrast to the mosaicplasty donor site morbidity is low and the size of the defect is not a limiting factor. The current studies about ACT of the talus show a stable repair of the defect with mostly hyaline-like cartilage and high patient satisfaction. Therefore, the procedure can be recommended for lesions\textbackslashtextgreater1 cm2. Concomitant treatment of posttraumatic deformities (malalignment), ligamentous instabilities, and especially the reconstruction of bony defects are compulsory.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5583815,Preclinical Testing of New Hydrogel Materials for Cartilage Repair: Overcoming Fixation Issues in a Large Animal Model,"Reinforced hydrogels represent a promising strategy for tissue engineering of articular cartilage. They can recreate mechanical and biological characteristics of native articular cartilage and promote cartilage regeneration in combination with mesenchymal stromal cells. One of the limitations of in vivo models for testing the outcome of tissue engineering approaches is implant fixation. The high mechanical stress within the knee joint, as well as the concave and convex cartilage surfaces, makes fixation of reinforced hydrogel challenging. Methods. Different fixation methods for full-thickness chondral defects in minipigs such as fibrin glue, BioGlue®, covering, and direct suturing of nonenforced and enforced constructs were compared. Because of insufficient fixation in chondral defects, superficial osteochondral defects in the femoral trochlea, as well as the femoral condyle, were examined using press-fit fixation. Two different hydrogels (starPEG and PAGE) were compared by 3D-micro-CT (μCT) analysis as well as histological analysis. Results. Our results showed fixation of below 50% for all methods in chondral defects. A superficial osteochondral defect of 1 mm depth was necessary for long-term fixation of a polycaprolactone (PCL)-reinforced hydrogel construct. Press-fit fixation seems to be adapted for a reliable fixation of 95% without confounding effects of glue or suture material. Despite the good integration of our constructs, especially in the starPEG group, visible bone lysis was detected in micro-CT analysis. There was no significant difference between the two hydrogels (starPEG and PAGE) and empty control defects regarding regeneration tissue and cell integration. However, in the starPEG group, more cell-containing hydrogel fragments were found within the defect area. Conclusion. Press-fit fixation in a superficial osteochondral defect in the medial trochlear groove of adult minipigs is a promising fixation method for reinforced hydrogels. To avoid bone lysis, future approaches should focus on multilayered constructs recreating the zonal cartilage as well as the calcified cartilage and the subchondral bone plate.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1615811,Bilayer Matrix Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation without Bone Graft for Knee Osteochondral Lesion Less than 8 mm Deep,"Abstract This article investigates the clinical and radiological results of bilayer matrix autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) membrane technique in the treatment of shallow osteochondral defects. An analysis was made of eight patients who were operated on using the bilayer MACI (Genzyme Biosurgery, Cambridge, MA) technique (mean age: 20.2 years, mean defect size: 3.8 cm2, mean defect depth: 6.2 ± 0.9 mm, and mean follow-up time: 22.1 ± 5.3 [14–26.1] months). According to the defect, the first membrane was secured to the base of the defect with the cells facing up, and the second membrane was implanted on top of the first membrane with the cells facing down using fibrin glue. Clinical assessment was performed with modified Cincinnati and Tegner Lysholm scores. Patients were evaluated using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) with a 15-channel transmit knee coil in the 6th, 12th, and 24th months postoperatively. Magnetic observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring was used to evaluate the cartilage tissue. The mean modified Cincinnati score was 36.4 (21–48) preoperatively and 84.2 (81–90) at 6 months postoperatively, 87.2 (82–92) at 12 months, and 89.6 (85–94) at 24 months (p &lt; 0.05). The postoperative results were evaluated as excellent. The mean Tegner Lysholm score was 36.4 (21–48) preoperatively and 88.2 (84–92), 90.2 (84–95), and 90.4 (86–95) at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively (p &lt; 0.05). According to the 3T MRI findings, the mean modified MOCART scores were 8 in the preimplantation period, 38 in the 6th postoperative month, 70 in the 12th postoperative month, and 79 in the 24th postoperative month (p &lt; 0.05). The 2-year follow-up MRI showed good regeneration, healing, and integration developing in time in cartilage tissue. In the treatment of shallow osteochondral defects, the bilayer MACI technique can be an alternative to filling the defect with bone graft.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.l.00773,Operative Treatment of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"➤ Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common injuries in recreational and professional athletes, with up to 50% of acute ankle sprains and fractures developing some form of chondral injury. Surgical treatment paradigms aim to restore the articular surface with a repair tissue similar to native cartilage and to provide long-term symptomatic relief.➤ Arthroscopic bone-marrow stimulation techniques, such as microfracture and drilling, perforate the subchondral plate with multiple openings to recruit mesenchymal stem cells from the underlying bone marrow to stimulate the differentiation of fibrocartilaginous repair tissue in the defect site. The ability of fibrocartilage to withstand mechanical loading and protect the subchondral bone over time is a concern.➤ Autologous osteochondral transplantation techniques replace the defect with a tubular unit of viable hyaline cartilage and bone from a donor site in the ipsilateral knee. In rare cases, a graft can also be harvested from the ipsilateral talus or contralateral knee. The limitations of donor site morbidity and the potential need for an osteotomy about the ankle should be considered. Some anterior or far posterior talar lesions can be accessed without arthrotomy or with a plafondplasty.➤ Osteochondral allograft transplantation allows an osteochondral lesion with a large surface area to be replaced with a single unit of viable articular cartilage and subchondral bone from a donor that is matched to size, shape, and surface curvature. The best available evidence suggests that this procedure should be limited to large-volume cystic lesions or salvage procedures.➤ Autologous chondrocyte implantation techniques require a two-stage procedure, the first for chondrocyte harvest and the second for implantation in a periosteum-covered or matrix-induced form after in vivo culture expansion. Theoretically, the transplantation of chondrocyte-like cells into the defect will result in hyaline-like repair tissue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-018-9820-2,Development of a Novel Large Animal Model to Evaluate Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells for Articular Cartilage Treatment,"Chondral lesion is a pathology with high prevalence, reaching as much as 63% of general population and 36% among athletes. The ability of human Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) to differentiate into chondroblasts in vitro suggests that this stem cell type may be useful for tissue bioengineering. However, we have yet to identify a study of large animal models in which DPSCs were used to repair articular cartilage. Therefore, this study aimed to describe a novel treatment for cartilage lesion with DPSCs on a large animal model.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were obtained from deciduous teeth and characterized by flow cytometry. DPSCs were cultured and added to a collagen type I/III biomaterial composite scaffold. Brazilian miniature pig (BR-1) was used. A 6-mm diameter, full-thickness chondral defect was created in each posterior medial condyle. The defects were covered with scaffold alone or scaffold + DPSCs on the contralateral side. Animals were euthanized 6 weeks post-surgery. Cartilage defects were analyzed macroscopically and histology according to modified O'Driscoll scoring system.Flow cytometry confirmed characterization of DPSCs as MSCs. Macroscopic and histological findings suggested that this time period was reasonable for evaluating cartilage repair. To our knowledge, this study provides the first description of an animal model using DPSCs to study the differentiation of hyaline articular cartilage in vivo.The animals tolerated the procedure well and did not show clinical or histological rejection of the DPSCs, reinforcing the feasibility of this descriptive miniature pig model for pre-clinical studies.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2019.12.004,Growth Factor Delivery to a Cartilage-Cartilage Interface Using Platelet-Rich Concentrates on a Hyaluronic Acid Scaffold,"To determine whether (1) human leukocyte-platelet-rich plasma (L-PRP) or (2) leukocyte-platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) delivered on a hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold at a bovine chondral defect, a simulated cartilage tear interface, in vitro would improve tissue formation based on biomechanical, histologic, and biochemical measures.L-PRF and L-PRP were prepared from 3 healthy volunteer donors and delivered in conjunction with HA scaffolds to defects created in full-thickness bovine cartilage plugs harvested from bovine femoral condyle and trochlea. Specimens were cultured in vitro for up to 42 days. Treatment groups included an HA scaffold alone and scaffolds containing L-PRF or L-PRP. Cartilage repair was assessed using biomechanical testing, histology, DNA quantification, and measurement of sulfated glycosaminoglycan and collagen content at 28 and 42 days.L-PRF elicited the greatest degree of defect filling and improvement in other histologic measures. L-PRF-treated specimens also had the greatest cellularity when compared with L-PRP and control at day 28 (560.4 μg vs 191.4 μg vs 124.2 μg, P = .15); at day 48, there remained a difference, although not significant, between L-PRF versus L-PRP (761.1 μg vs 589.3 μg, P = .219) . L-PRF had greater collagen deposition when compared with L-PRP at day 42 (40.1 μg vs 16.3 μg, P < .0001). L-PRF had significantly greater maximum interfacial strength compared with the control at day 42 (10.92 N vs 0.66 N, P = .015) but had no significant difference compared with L-PRP (10.92 N vs 6.58 N, P = .536). L-PRP facilitated a greater amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycan production at day 42 when compared with L-PRF (15.9 μg vs 4.3 μg, P = .009).Delivery of leukocyte-rich platelet concentrates in conjunction with a HA scaffold may allow for improvements in cartilage healing through different pathways. L-PRF was not superior to L-PRP in its biomechanical strength, suggesting that both treatments may be effective in improving biomechanical strength of healing cartilage through different pathways.The delivery of platelet-rich concentrates in conjunction HA scaffolds may augment healing cartilaginous injuries.",0

It was hypothesised that the increased number of autologous AD-MSCs after culture expansion is a safe and efficient cartilage repair procedure, which improves overtime chondrogenesis in cartilage lesions Methods Twenty-five consecutive patients treated for a symptomatic cartilage defect were prospectively followed for 3 years. The median age of patients was 30.5 (range 16-43) with a median BMI of 23.6 kg/m(2) (range 19-29) and an average size of the lesion of 3.5 cm(2) (range 2-6). All patients underwent a single-stage procedure consisting in filling each defect with autologous culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells embedded in a trimmed-to-fit commercially available biodegradable matrix. Pre-operative and post-operative evaluation included knee-related clinical and functional evaluation based on objective and subjective scores at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months and MRI evaluation of the repair tissue using the MOCART score at 12 and 24 months. Results Clinical outcomes recorded significant improvements (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) at the final follow-up compared with baseline as following: all subcategories of KOOS Score, the IKDC subjective from 40.9 (range 20.7-65.6) to 76.9 (range 42-90.3), Tegner Activity Score from 3 (range 2-4) to 4 (range 3-4), VAS for pain from 6 (range 4-8) to 1 (range 0-3). All patients improve significantly their IKDC objective scores. The MRI findings showed complete filling of the defect and integration to the border zone for 65% of the patients. Two patients underwent post-operative biopsies and the histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaline-like tissue. Conclusions Adipose-derived culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells were shown to be an efficient and safe single-stage cell-based procedure for symptomatic, full-thickness knee chondral lesions. The findings of the present study demonstrate that all patients presented significant mid-term clinical, functional and radiological improvement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546509346395,Cell Carriers as the Next Generation of Cell Therapy for Cartilage Repair,"Since the first patient was implanted with autologous cultured chondrocytes more than 20 years ago, new variations of cell therapies for cartilage repair have appeared. Autologous chondrocyte implantation, a first-generation cell therapy, uses suspended autologous cultured chondrocytes in combination with a periosteal patch. Collagen-covered autologous cultured chondrocyte implantation, a second-generation cell therapy, uses suspended cultured chondrocytes with a collagen type I/III membrane. Today's demand for transarthroscopic procedures has resulted in the development of third-generation cell therapies that deliver autologous cultured chondrocytes using cell carriers or cell-seeded scaffolds.To review the current evidence of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure, the most widely used carrier system to date. Also discussed are the characteristics of type I/III collagen membranes, behavior of cells associated with the membrane, surgical technique, rehabilitation, clinical outcomes, and quality of repair tissue.Systematic review.Relevant publications were identified by searching Medline from its inception (1949) to December 2007; peer-reviewed publications of preclinical and clinical cell behavior, manufacturing process, surgical technique, and rehabilitation protocols were identified. Preclinical and clinical studies were included if they contained primary data and used a type I/III collagen membrane.Data from these studies demonstrate that patients treated with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation have an overall improvement in clinical outcomes. Reduced visual analog scale pain levels (range, 1.7-5.32 points) and improvements in the modified Cincinnati (range, 3.8-34.2 points), Lysholm-Gillquist (range, 23.09-47.6 points), Tegner-Lysholm (range, 1.39-3.9 points), and International Knee Documentation Classification scale (P <.05) were observed. Patients had good-quality (hyaline-like) repair tissue as assessed by arthroscopic evaluation (including International Cartilage Repair Society score), magnetic resonance imaging, and histology, as well as a low incidence of postoperative complications.The findings suggest that matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation is a promising third-generation cell therapy for the repair of symptomatic, full-thickness articular cartilage defects.",0
,[Treatment of cartilaginous defects in the knee: recommendations from the Dutch Orthopaedic Association].,"Cartilaginous defects in the knee occur frequently and can cause the patient considerable limitations. They are diagnosed and classified by means of MRI and arthroscopy. The surgical options available to treat deep chondral lesions include bone marrow stimulation techniques (microfracture treatment), chondrocyte therapies (autologous chondrocyte implantation) and tissue replacement therapies (osteochondral autologous transplantation). Microfracture treatment and osteochondral autologous transplantation are suitable for treating chondral lesions that extend to the subchondral bone and are smaller than 2 and 4 cm2, respectively. Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a suitable method for treating single symptomatic chondral lesions larger than 2 cm2 in adults up to 50 years of age. There are no significant differences regarding the effectiveness of microfracture treatment, autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral autologous transplantation for small defects: all show good clinical and functional short- and medium-term results. New second- and third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation techniques seem to yield more sustainable tissue repair and better clinical long-term results for lesions larger than 4 cm2 in comparison to microfracture treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1071100715620423,Autologous Osteochondral Transplantation for Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"Autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) is used to treat osteochondral lesions (OCLs) of the talus, typically reserved for lesions greater than 150 mm(2). Few studies exist examining the functional and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes following this procedure. The purpose of this study was to investigate functional and MRI outcomes, including quantitative T2 mapping following AOT.Eighty-five consecutive patients who underwent AOT were identified. Functional outcomes were assessed pre- and postoperatively using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS). The Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score was used to assess cartilage incorporation. Quantitative T2 MRI relaxation time of graft tissue and adjacent normal cartilage values were recorded in a subset of 61 patients. The mean clinical follow-up was 47.2 months, with mean MRI follow-up of 24.8 months.Mean FAOS improved pre- to postoperatively from 50 to 81 (P < .001). The mean MOCART score was 85.8. Lesion size was negatively correlated with MOCART score (r = -0.36, P = .004). Superficial T2 values in graft tissue were higher than control tissue (42.0 vs 35.8, P < .001). Deep T2 values in graft tissue were similar to the control values (30.9 vs 30.0, P = .305). Functional outcomes were similar in patients irrespective of whether they had previous microfracture or concomitant procedures.AOT was an effective treatment for large OCLs of the talus in the current study. MOCART scoring indicated good structural integrity of the graft. Quantitative T2 mapping suggests that graft tissue may not always mirror native hyaline cartilage. The long-term implications of this are not yet known.Level IV, case series.",0

Matrix-guided autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI(R)) was compared with microfracture (MFX) to demonstrate the reconstitution of cartilage over a two-year period using the morphological capabilities of MRI. Patients and methods. 27 patients (9 females and 18 males, mean age 33 years) underwent MACI on the knee joint. The defects originated from trauma (15 cases), osteochondritis dissecans (8 cases) and chronic repetitive trauma (4 cases) and were localized at the condyles (24 cases) or patella (3 cases). All patients were examined postoperatively after 1, 3,6,12 and 24 months with a 1,5 T unit (Gyroscan, Philips) using proton- and T2w spinecho and T1w fatsuppressed 3D gradientecho sequences. We measured the signal intensities of the implant and neighbouring cartilage to calculate the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and the thickness of cartilage and implant layers to define the defect filling rate. Finally, partial and complete remission was defined on MRI and compared with clinical data and morphology on MRI. Additionally, 7 patients were treated with MFX and, subsequently examined on MRI with the same protocol. Results. After MACI, MRI showed a partial but no complete equilibration of signal intensities of implant and adjacent cartilage over the 1 and 2 year follow-up periods which was shown by reduction of CNR from 21 to 10 on 3D-GE and from 26 to 9 on T2w SE sequences. Continuous growth of the implants resulted in an increased filling of the defects starting at 40% after 0.5 year to 85% after 1 or 2 years. Complete remission was found on MRI in 17/27 cases, and remission rate was influenced by etiology of cartilage defect but not by age and gender of patients or size and location of defects. The Lysholm-Gillquist score improved from 49.7 to 97.3. After MFX equilibration of signal intensities and growth of the regenerating fibrous cartilage was less pronounced and complete remission was found in only 2/7 cases. In addition, the clinical score improved from 45.5 to 74.2. Conclusion. Direct imaging of cartilage with MRI and assessment of clinical scores allowed improved documentation of the outcome after MACI and MFX. MRI showed that MACI is superior to MFX concerning rate of complete remissions and filling of the defect with regenerating tissue. Clinical examinations showed better scores for MACI than for MFX.",1

Treatment consisted of surgical implantation of an autologous-based matrix of hyaline cartilage chips combined with a clot of plasma poor in platelets and intraarticular injection of plasma rich in growth factors. Outcome measures at 1, 3 and 6months included macroscopic International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, histological and immunohistochemical analysis for collagen expression, and transmission electron microscopy study.ResultsThe 6-month macroscopic evaluation showed nearly normal (11.10.7) cartilage repair assessment. The ICRS score was significantly higher at 6months compared to 3months (5.5 +/- 1.3; p\textbackslashtextless0.0001) and 1 (1.1 +/- 0.4; p\textbackslashtextless0.0001) month. At 6months, hyaline cartilage tissue filling the defect was observed with adequate integration of the regenerated cartilage at the surrounding healthy cartilage margin. At 6months, mature chondrons and cartilage matrix contained collagen fibers with masked fibrillary structure, and the expression of collagen in the newly formed cartilage was similar in intensity and distribution pattern compared to the healthy adjacent cartilage.Conclusions This novel treatment enhanced chondrogenesis and regenerated hyaline cartilage at 6 months with nearly normal macroscopic ICRS assessment. Histological analysis showed equivalent structure to mature cartilage tissue in the defect and a collagen expression pattern in the newly formed cartilage similar to that found in adjacent healthy articular cartilage. The present technique may have clinical application for chondral injuries in humans because this procedure is cheap (no need for allograft, or expensive instrumentation/biomaterials/techniques), easy and fast-performing through a small arthrotomy, and safe (no rejection possibility because the patients' own tissue, cells, and plasma are used).",0

There have been no comparative studies of the two techniques. This retrospective study assessed functional outcome of patients using the EQ-5D, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Modified Cincinnati scores at follow-up of 1-5 years. There were 66 patients in the study (35 TruFit and 31 Mosaicplasty): 44 males and 22 females with a mean age of 37.3 years (SD 12.6). The mean BMI was 26.8. Thirty-six articular cartilage lesions were due to trauma, twenty-six due to osteochondritis dissecans and three due to non-specific degenerative change or unknown. There was no difference between the two groups age (n.s.), sex (n.s.), BMI (n.s.), defect location (n.s.) or aetiology (n.s.). The median follow-up was 22 months for the TruFit cohort and 30 months for the mosaicplasty group. There was no significant difference in the requirement for re-operation (n.s). Patients undergoing autologous mosaicplasty had a higher rate of returning to sport (p = 0.006), lower EQ-5D pain scores (p = 0.048) and higher KOOS activities of daily living (p = 0.029) scores. Sub-group analysis showed no difference related to the number of cases the surgeon performed. Patients requiring re-operation had lower outcome scores regardless of their initial procedure. This study demonstrated significantly better outcomes using two validated outcome scores (KOOS, EQ-5D), and an ability to return to sport in those undergoing autologous mosaicplasty compared to those receiving TruFit plugs.

Purpose: To determine whether implantation of a composite of allogeneic umbilical cord blood–derived mesenchymal stem cells and 4% hyaluronate (UCB-MSC-HA) will result in reliable cartilage restoration in patients with large, full-thickness cartilage defects and whether any clinical improvements can be maintained up to 5 years postoperatively. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A randomized controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted for 48 weeks, and the participants then underwent extended 5-year observational follow-up. Enrolled were patients with large, full-thickness cartilage defects (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade 4) in a single compartment of the knee joint, as confirmed by arthroscopy. The defect was treated either with UCB-MSC-HA implantation through mini-arthrotomy or with microfracture. The primary outcome was proportion of participants who improved by ≥1 grade on the ICRS Macroscopic Cartilage Repair Assessment (blinded evaluation) at 48-week arthroscopy. Secondary outcomes included histologic assessment; changes in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score from baseline; and adverse events. Results: Among 114 randomized participants (mean age, 55.9 years; 67% female; body mass index, 26.2 kg/m 2 ), 89 completed the phase 3 clinical trial and 73 were enrolled in the 5-year follow-up study. The mean defect size was 4.9 cm 2 in the UCB-MSC-HA group and 4.0 cm 2 in the microfracture group ( P = .051). At 48 weeks, improvement by ≥1 ICRS grade was seen in 97.7% of the UCB-MSC-HA group versus 71.7% of the microfracture group ( P = .001); the overall histologic assessment score was also superior in the UCB-MSC-HA group ( P = .036). Improvement in VAS pain, WOMAC, and IKDC scores were not significantly different between the groups at 48 weeks, however the clinical results were significantly better in the UCB-MSC-HA group at 3- to 5-year follow-up ( P &lt; .05). There were no differences between the groups in adverse events. Conclusion: In older patients with symptomatic, large, full-thickness cartilage defects with or without osteoarthritis, UCB-MSC-HA implantation resulted in improved cartilage grade at second-look arthroscopy and provided more improvement in pain and function up to 5 years compared with microfracture.

Quantitative MR measurements were also obtained of the contralateral knee and the utility as reference standard was investigated.Both knees of 20 patients with Mega-OATS osteochondral repair at the medial femoral condyle (MFC) were studied using 3T MRI 9 years after the procedure. MR-sequences included morphological sequences and a 2D multislice multiecho (MSME) spin echo (SE) sequence for quantitative cartilage T2 mapping. Cartilage segmentation was performed at the cartilage repair site and six additional knee compartments. Semi-quantitative MR observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scores and clinical Lysholm scores were obtained. Paired t-tests and Spearman correlations were used for statistical analysis.Global T2-values were significantly higher at ipsilateral knees compared to contralateral knees (42.1 ± 3.0 ms vs 40.4 ± 2.6 ms, P = 0.018). T2-values of the Mega-OATS site correlated significantly with MOCART scores (R = -0.64, P = 0.006). The correlations between MOCART and Lysholm scores and between absolute T2-values and Lysholm scores were not significant (P > 0.05). However, higher T2 side-to-side differences at the femoral condyles correlated significantly with more severe clinical symptoms (medial, R = -0.53, P = 0.030; lateral, R = -0.51, P = 0.038).Despite long-term survival, 9 years after Mega-OATS procedures, T2-values of the grafts were increased compared to contralateral knees. Clinical scores correlated best with T2 side-to-side differences of the femoral condyles, indicating that intraindividual adjustment may be beneficial for outcome evaluation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.otsr.2011.09.007,Treatment of knee cartilage defect in 2010,"Treatment of knee cartilage defect, a true challenge, should not only reconstruct hyaline cartilage on a long-term basis, but also be able to prevent osteoarthritis. Osteochondral knee lesions occur in either traumatic lesions or in osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). These lesions can involve all the articular surfaces of the knee in its three compartments. In principle, this review article covers symptomatic ICRS grade C or D lesions, depth III and IV, excluding management of superficial lesions, asymptomatic lesions that are often discovered unexpectedly, and kissing lesions, which arise prior to or during osteoarthritis. For clarity sake, the international classifications used are reviewed, for both functional assessment (ICRS and functional IKDC for osteochondral fractures, Hughston for osteochondritis) and morphological lesion evaluations (the ICRS macroscopic evaluation for fractures, the Bedouelle or SOFCOT for osteochondritis, and MOCART for MRI). The therapeutic armamentarium to treat these lesions is vast, but accessibility varies greatly depending on the country and the legislation in effect. Many comparative studies have been conducted, but they are rarely of high scientific quality; the center effect is nearly constant because patients are often referred to certain centers for an expert opinion. The indications defined herein use algorithms that take into account the size of the cartilage defect and the patient's functional needs for cases of fracture and the vitality, stability, and size of the fragment for cases of osteochondritis dissecans. Fractures measuring less than 2 cm(2) are treated with either microfracturing or mosaic osteochondral grafting, between 2 and 4 cm(2) with microfractures covered with a membrane or a culture of second- or third-generation chondrocytes, and beyond this size, giant lesions are subject to an exceptional allografting procedure, harvesting from the posterior condyle, or chondrocyte culture on a 3D matrix to restore volume. Cases of stable osteochondritis dissecans with closed articular cartilage can be simply monitored or treated with perforation in cases of questionable vitality. Cases of open joint cartilage are treated with a PLUS fixation if their vitality is preserved; if not, they are treated comparably to osteochondral fractures, with the type of filling depending on the defect size.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.20958,Orderly osteochondral regeneration in a sheep model using a novel nano-composite multilayered biomaterial,"The objective of this article was to investigate the safety and regenerative potential of a newly developed biomimetic scaffold when applied to osteochondral defects in an animal model. A new multilayer gradient nano-composite scaffold was obtained by nucleating collagen fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. In the femoral condyles of 12 sheep, 24 osteochondral lesions were created. Animals were randomized into three treatment groups: scaffold alone, scaffold colonized in vitro with autologous chondrocytes and empty defects. Six months after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and the lesions were histologically evaluated. Histologic and gross evaluation of specimens showed good integration of the chondral surface in all groups except for the control group. Significantly better bone regeneration was observed both in the group receiving the scaffold alone and in the group with scaffold loaded with autologous chondrocytes. No difference in cartilage surface reconstruction and osteochondral defect filling was noted between cell-seeded and cell-free groups. In the control group, no bone or cartilage defect healing occurred, and the defects were filled with fibrous tissue. Quantitative macroscopic and histological score evaluations confirmed the qualitative trends observed. The results of the present study showed that this novel osteochondral scaffold is safe and easy to use, and may represent a suitable matrix to direct and coordinate the process of bone and hyaline-like cartilage regeneration. The comparable regeneration process observed with or without autologous chondrocytes suggests that the main mode of action of the scaffold is based on the recruitment of local cells.",0

However, cell fate and action after transplantation remain unclear. This study aimed at evaluating the biodistribution and efficacy of MSCs after IA injection. We used an immunocompetent, dual transgenic rat model, which is based on donor rats ubiquitously expressing heat stable human placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP), and recipient rats expressing a heat sensitive ALPP form. A focal cartilage defect was created in the patellofemoral groove of recipient rats. Bone marrow-derived MSCs isolated from donor rats were injected into the synovial cavity of recipients, and cell tracking was performed in distant organs and knees over 6 months post-injection. A few donor MSCs were observed in the lung of one of the recipients, 1 day post-injection. We failed to detect donor MSCs in any of the studied tissues at all later time points. IA-injected MSCs remained in the synovial cavity, engrafted within the cartilage lesion, and were detectable up to 1 month post-injection. Although the number of MSCs decreased over time, MSCs injection promoted cartilage regeneration as evidenced by histology and immunofluorescent collagen staining. Our study supports the safety and efficacy of using MSCs for cartilage repair via IA delivery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2007.04.020,Classification of graft hypertrophy after autologous chondrocyte implantation of full-thickness chondral defects in the knee,"Graft hypertrophy is a major complication seen in autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) with a periosteal flap. We present the first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification for periosteal hypertrophy including a grading of clinical symptoms and the surgical consequences.One hundred and two patients with isolated chondral defects underwent an ACI covered with periosteum and were evaluated preoperatively, 6, 18 and 36 months after surgery. Exclusion criteria were meniscal pathologies, axial malpositioning and ligament instabilities. Baseline clinical scores were compared with follow-up data by paired Wilcoxon-tests for the modified Cincinnati knee, the ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) and a new MRI score including the parameters defect filling, subchondral edema, effusion, cartilage signal and graft hypertrophy. Hypertrophic changes were graded from 1 (minimal) to 4 (severe).All scores showed significant improvement (P<0.001) over the entire study period. Patients with femoral lesions had significantly better results than patients with patella lesions after 18 and 36 months postoperative (P<0.03). Periosteal hypertrophy occurred in 28% of all patients. Fifty percent of all patella implants developed hypertrophic changes. No patient with grade 1, and all patients with grade 4 hypertrophy had to undergo revision surgery. The Pearson correlation between graft hypertrophy and ICRS score was 0.78 after 6 months, and 0.69 after 36 months (P<0.01). Inclusion of graft hypertrophy in the MRI score improves the correlation to clinical scores from 0.6 to 0.69.Grading graft hypertrophy helps to identify patients needing an early shaving of the graft. Its integration into an MRI score improves correlation with clinical scores. Re-operation depends on the grade of hypertrophy and clinical symptoms.",0
https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2016.60967,Incomplete defect filling after third generation autologous chondrocyte implantation,"Third generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a suitable method for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee joint. However, knowledge about the development of graft thickness and the clinical relevance of incomplete defect filling in the postoperative course is low. This prospective study analyses the graft integration into the surrounding cartilage, with special consideration of the graft thickness.A total of 71 consecutive patients with 79 cartilage defects were treated with third generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (NOVOCART 3D) in the knee. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 years. Graft thickness was measured compared to the surrounding healthy cartilage. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring system and the visual analogue scale (VAS) were used for clinical evaluation. Cartilage defect filling was classified as the percentage of the surrounding cartilage.The average graft thickness showed a significant increase between 3 and 6 months after autologous chondrocyte implantation. Incomplete defect filling occurred in 44 (55.7%) cases. Of these, 33 cases showed incomplete defect filling grade I (> 75%), 10 cases were grade II (> 50%) and one case grade III (> 25%). Incomplete defect filling grade IV (< 25%) was not observed. Incomplete defect filling occurred significantly more often in women (p = 0.021), without worse clinical results.Graft thickness after third generation autologous chondrocyte implantation shows increasing graft thickness over the period of 2 years postoperatively. A high rate of incomplete defect filling in the surrounding cartilage was observed, without worse clinical results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.11.022,Enhancing chondrogenesis and mechanical strength retention in physiologically relevant hydrogels with incorporation of hyaluronic acid and direct loading of TGF-β,"Cell-loaded hydrogels are frequently applied in cartilage tissue engineering for their biocompatibility, ease of application, and ability to conform to various defect sites. As a bioactive adjunct to the biomaterial, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) has been shown to be essential for cell differentiation into a chondrocyte phenotype and maintenance thereof, but the low amounts of endogenous TGF-β in the in vivo joint microenvironment necessitate a mechanism for controlled delivery and release of this growth factor. In this study, TGF-β3 was directly loaded with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into poly-d,l-lactic acid/polyethylene glycol/poly-d,l-lactic acid (PDLLA-PEG) hydrogel, or PDLLA-PEG with the addition of hyaluronic acid (PDLLA/HA), and cultured in vitro. We hypothesize that the inclusion of HA within PDLLA-PEG would result in a controlled release of the loaded TGF-β3 and lead to a robust cartilage formation without the use of TGF-β3 in the culture medium. ELISA analysis showed that TGF-β3 release was effectively slowed by HA incorporation, and retention of TGF-β3 in the PDLLA/HA scaffold was detected by immunohistochemistry for up to 3 weeks. By means of both in vitro culture and in vivo implantation, we found that sulfated glycosaminoglycan production was higher in PDLLA/HA groups with homogenous distribution throughout the scaffold than PDLLA groups. Finally, with an optimal loading of TGF-β3 at 10 μg/mL, as determined by RT-PCR and glycosaminoglycan production, an almost twofold increase in Young's modulus of the construct was seen over a 4-week period compared to TGF-β3 delivery in the culture medium. Taken together, our results indicate that the direct loading of TGF-β3 and stem cells in PDLLA/HA has the potential to be a one-step point-of-care treatment for cartilage injury. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Stem cell-seeded hydrogels are commonly used in cell-based cartilage tissue engineering, but they generally fail to possess physiologically relevant mechanical properties suitable for loading. Moreover, degradation of the hydrogel in vivo with time further decreases mechanical suitability of the hydrogel due in part to the lack of TGF-β3 signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that incorporation of hyaluronic acid (HA) into a physiologically stiff PDLLA-PEG hydrogel allowed for slow release of one-time preloaded TGF-β3, and when loaded with adult mesenchymal stem cells and cultured in vitro, it resulted in higher chondrogenic gene expression and constructs of significantly higher mechanical strength than constructs cultured in conventional TGF-β3-supplemented medium. Similar effects were also observed in constructs implanted in vivo. Our results indicate that direct loading of TGF-β3 combined with HA in the physiologically stiff PDLLA-PEG hydrogel has the potential to be used for one-step point-of-care treatment of cartilage injury.",0

Repair for massive meniscal defect remains a challenge owing to a lack of cell kinetics for the menisci precursors in knee joint. The synovium plays pivotal roles during the natural course of meniscal healing and contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with high chondrogenic potential. Here, we investigated whether intra-articular injected synovium-MSCs enhanced meniscal regeneration in rat massive meniscal defect. To track the injected cells, we developed transgenic rats expressing dual luciferase (Luc) and LacZ. The cells derived from synovium of the rats demonstrated colony-forming ability and multipotentiality, both characteristics of MSCs. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that gene expression of meniscal cells was closer to that of synovium-MSCs than to that of bone marrow-MSCs. Two to 8 weeks after five million Luc/LacZ+ synovium-MSCs were injected into massive meniscectomized knee of wild-type rat, macroscopically, the menisci regenerated much better than it did in the control group. After 12 weeks, the regenerated menisci were LacZ positive, produced type 2 collagen, and showed meniscal features by transmission electron microscopy. In in-vivo luminescence analysis, photons increased in the meniscus-resected knee over a 3-day period, then decreased without detection in all other organs. LacZ gene derived from MSCs could not be detected in other organs except in synovium by real-time PCR. Synovium-MSCs injected into the massive meniscectomized knee adhered to the lesion, differentiated into meniscal cells directly, and promoted meniscal regeneration without mobilization to distant organs. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546513498503,Restoration of the Meniscus,"Over the past 2 decades there has been a profound shift in our perception of the role of the meniscus in the knee joint. Orthopaedic opinion now favors salvaging and restoring the damaged meniscus where possible. Basic science is characterizing its form (anatomy) and functionality (biological and biomechanical) in an attempt to understand the effect of meniscal injury and repair on the knee joint as a whole. The meniscus is a complex tissue and has warranted extensive basic science, translational, and clinical research to identify techniques to augment healing and even replace the meniscus. The application of quantitative magnetic resonance image sequencing to the meniscus and articular cartilage of the affected compartment promises to add a quantifiable outcome measure to the body of clinical evidence that supports restoration of the meniscus. This article discusses the recent advances and outcomes in the pursuit of meniscal restoration with particular focus on the use of augmentation strategies in meniscal repair, meniscal imaging, and translational strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.2005.11.1789,Repair of Osteochondral Defects in Rabbits with Ectopically Produced Cartilage,"Cartilage has poor regenerative capacity. Donor site morbidity and interference with joint homeostasis should be considered when applying the autologous chondrocyte transplantation technique. The use of ectopically produced cartilage, derived from periosteum, might be a novel method to heal cartilage defects. Ectopic cartilage was produced by dissecting a piece of periosteum from the tibia of rabbits. After 14 days the reactive tissue at the dissection site was harvested and a graft was cored out and press-fit implanted in an osteochondral defect in the medial condyle of the femur with or without addition of hyaluronan. After 3 weeks and 3 months the repair reaction was evaluated by histology. Thionine- and collagen type II-stained sections were evaluated for graft viability, ingrowth of the graft, and joint surface repair. Empty defects remained empty 3 weeks after implantation, ectopic cartilage filled the defect to the level of the surrounding cartilage. Histologically, the grafts were viable, consisting mainly of cartilage, and showed a variable pattern of ingrowth. Three months after implantation empty defects with or without hyaluronan were filled primarily with fibrocartilaginous tissue. Defects treated with ectopic cartilage contained mixtures of fibrocartilaginous and hyaline cartilage. Sometimes a tidemark was observed in the new articular cartilage and the orientation of the cells resembled that of healthy articular cartilage. Subchondral bone repair was excellent. The modified O'Driscoll scores for empty defects without and with hyaluronan were 12.7 +/- 6.4 and 15.3 +/- 3.2; for treated defects scores were better (15.4 +/- 3.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.9). In this conceptual study the use of ectopic cartilage derived from periosteum appears to be a promising novel method for joint surface repair in rabbits.",0

Demographic variables and short-term (30-day) complications were analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance and post hoc analysis. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze trends over time.A total of 15,609 procedures performed between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed. On average, 342.2 ± 27.9 cartilage procedures were performed per 100,000 operations. There was a linear increase in the management of overall cartilage procedures per 100,000 operations (P = .002). There were also linear increases in arthroscopic osteochondral autograft transplantation, arthroscopic osteochondral allograft transplantation, open osteochondral autograft transplantation, open osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation (P < .001, P = .037, P = .001, P = .006, and P = .002, respectively). Meniscectomy was the most frequently performed concomitant procedure (9.7%-64.2% of cases). Chondroplasty and microfracture showed no change in frequency over time (P = .140 and P = .720, respectively). The overall complication rate was 2.1% for chondroplasty, 1.4% for microfracture, 1.8% for arthroscopic osteochondral autograft transplantation, 1.0% for arthroscopic osteochondral allograft transplantation, 1.4% for open osteochondral autograft transplantation, 1.1% for open osteochondral allograft transplantation, and 0.75% for autologous chondrocyte implantation. Deep vein thrombosis was the most common complication, occurring in 0.4% to 1.0% of cases. No statistically significant difference was found in complication rates between procedures (P = .105).Cartilage restoration is becoming an increasingly popular modality to address chondral defects. Minimal complication rates suggest that these procedures may be safely performed concomitantly with other interventions.Level IV, retrospective database analysis.",0

Here we reported a combined technique for articular cartilage repair, consisting of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) transfected with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene and NaOH-treated poly(lactic- co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) scaffolds. In the present study, BMMSCs or CTGF-modified BMMSCs seeded on PLGA or NaOH-treated PLGA scaffolds were incubated in vitro and NaOH-treated PLGA significantly stimulated proliferation of BMMSCs, while CTGF gene transfer promoted chondrogenic differentiation. The effects of the composite on the repair of cartilage defects were evaluated in rabbit knee joints in vivo. Full-thickness cartilage defects (diameter: 5 mm; depth: 3 mm) were created unilaterally in the patellar groove. Defects were either left empty ( n = 18) or implanted with BMMSCs/ PLGA ( n = 18), BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA ( n = 18), or CTGF-modified BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA ( n = 18). The defect area was examined grossly, histologically, and mechanically at 6, 12, and 24 weeks post-operatively. Implanted cells were tracked using adeno-LacZ labeling at 6 weeks after implantation. Overall, the CTGF-modified BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA group showed successful hyaline-like cartilage regeneration similar to normal cartilage, which was superior to the other groups using gross examination, qualitative and quantitative histology, and mechanical assessment. The in vivo viability of the implanted cells was demonstrated by their retention for 6 weeks after implantation. These findings suggested that a combination of CTGF-modified BMMSCs and NaOH-treated PLGA may be an alternative treatment for large osteochondral defects in high-loading sites.",0

An arthroscopic repair technique that transplants chondral osseous replacement plugs to fill the defect (the COR technique; Mitek Products, Westwood, MA) offers an immediate solution for these lesions. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical and radiographic results of femoral chondral osseous replacement for full-thickness articular cartilage lesions between 2.5 and 1.0 cm in diameter.Case series.A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients from 2 centers treated for full-thickness femoral articular cartilage lesions using a chondral osseous autograft transplantation technique was performed. All knees were evaluated both preoperatively and postoperatively by physical examination, radiographs, and Lysholm and Tegner knee scores. Inclusion criteria were full-thickness femoral condyle defects greater than 1 cm and less than 2.5 cm in diameter, and a minimum 24-month follow-up. Exclusion criteria were associated tibial defects, patellar defects, or generalized arthritic change. Grafts harvested from the superior, lateral femoral notch were press-fit into drilled holes to fill the femoral defects.Thirty-six patients met the inclusion criteria with an average follow-up of 48 months (range, 24 to 89 months). Their average age was 43 years and there were 20 men and 16 women. The medial femoral condyle was involved in 27 cases and the lateral femoral condyle in 9. The average Lysholm score increased from 44 preoperatively to 84 at follow-up. The average Tegner score at follow-up was 5. Repeat arthroscopy was performed in 14 patients and showed good incorporation of the grafts in all cases. Radiographic examinations revealed no arthritic changes at follow-up.This technique successfully transplants chondral osseous grafts within the knee that remain viable. No radiographic arthritic changes were observed and the midterm clinical result was favorable for these patients. Further investigation of the long-term results is required.Level 4, no or historical control.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-44855-3,Meniscus-Derived Matrix Scaffolds Promote the Integrative Repair of Meniscal Defects,"Abstract Meniscal tears have a poor healing capacity, and damage to the meniscus is associated with significant pain, disability, and progressive degenerative changes in the knee joint that lead to osteoarthritis. Therefore, strategies to promote meniscus repair and improve meniscus function are needed. The objective of this study was to generate porcine meniscus-derived matrix (MDM) scaffolds and test their effectiveness in promoting meniscus repair via migration of endogenous meniscus cells from the surrounding meniscus or exogenously seeded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Both endogenous meniscal cells and MSCs infiltrated the MDM scaffolds. In the absence of exogenous cells, the 8% MDM scaffolds promoted the integrative repair of an in vitro meniscal defect. Dehydrothermal crosslinking and concentration of the MDM influenced the biochemical content and shear strength of repair, demonstrating that the MDM can be tailored to promote tissue repair. These findings indicate that native meniscus cells can enhance meniscus healing if a scaffold is provided that promotes cellular infiltration and tissue growth. The high affinity of cells for the MDM and the ability to remodel the scaffold reveals the potential of MDM to integrate with native meniscal tissue to promote long-term repair without necessarily requiring exogenous cells.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-06099-x,Bone marrow aspirate concentration provided better results in cartilage regeneration to microfracture in knee of osteoarthritic patients,"PURPOSE: To determine whether microfracture with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) improves functional outcome and cartilage regeneration better than microfracture alone in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for medial unicompartmental osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Among 436 patients treated with HTO for medial unicompartmental OA with varus deformity between 2010 and 2016, clinical outcomes were retrospectively compared between the microfracture alone group (group I, 43 cases) and microfracture with BMAC augmentation group (group II, 48 cases). Of these, 64 patients underwent a second-look arthroscopic assessment. Clinical outcomes were compared based on the Knee Society Score (KSS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Cartilage regeneration was assessed according to Koshino's staging system and the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA) grading system. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, there were no significant intergroup differences in terms of KSS for pain and function (p \textbackslashtextgreater 0.05). Moreover, WOMAC scores were similar between the two groups (p \textbackslashtextgreater 0.05). Regarding second-look arthroscopy findings, according to Koshino's staging system, there was no significant intergroup difference in terms of defect coverage (p = 0.187). However, group II showed a significantly better mean CRA score than group I (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes and cartilage regeneration between the groups. However, the CRA score was significantly higher with BMAC augmentation and microfracture than microfracture alone. Therefore, BMAC augmentation had a synergistic effect for a better cartilage regeneration, although studies with a longer follow-up might help to confirm whether microfracture with BMAC augmentation would ensure better clinical outcomes than microfracture alone for the treatment of knee OA.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44785-8_10,Biomimetic Approaches for the Engineering of Osteochondral Tissues,"Osteochondral defects induced by trauma or pathology remain a big challenge in orthopedics. These defects comprise injuries in both the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone. Due to the limited regeneration ability of articular cartilage, this kind of defects is normally irreparable and would gradually deteriorate toward osteoarthritis which requires surgical intervention. The current clinical treatments for osteochondral defects, such as total joint replacement and osteochondral autograft transplantation, are not ideal long-term solutions for this problem. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine provides a possible and prospective curative strategy for this clinical hinder. Nevertheless, In order to successfully solve this problem, there are still many basic and critical questions must be answered. These include the optimization on scaffold’s composition and structure, selection of suitable cell source, modulation of primary/stem cell fate or engineered osteochondral tissue, incorporation of bioactive factors, and spatial regeneration of the chondral layer, subchondral layers and the interface. Biomimetic strategy has been employed to explore these fields and exciting progresses have been achieved. This chapter summarizes these interesting advances of the pre-clinical studies on engineering of osteochondral tissue in the last 5 years. Special attentions were given to the development of biomimetic layered scaffolds with dependences on composition, cell source, or bioactive factors. In addition, cell fate regulation, external stimuli and interface regeneration were discussed. New insights and promising directions for the future study in osteochondral regeneration were also provided.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0885328215575762,Three-dimensional polycaprolactone–hydroxyapatite scaffolds combined with bone marrow cells for cartilage tissue engineering,"The goal of this study was to investigate the chondrogenic potential of three-dimensional polycaprolactone–hydroxyapatite (PCL–HA) scaffolds loaded with bone marrow cells in vitro and the effect of PCL–HA scaffolds on osteochondral repair in vivo. Here, bone marrow was added to the prepared PCL–HA scaffolds and cultured in chondrogenic medium for 10 weeks. Osteochondral defects were created in the trochlear groove of 29 knees in 17 New Zealand white rabbits, which were then divided into four groups that underwent: implantation of PCL–HA scaffolds (left knee, n = 17; Group 1), microfracture (right knee, n = 6; Group 2), autologous osteochondral transplantation (right knee, n = 6; Group 3), and no treatment (right knee, n = 5; Control). Extracellular matrix produced by bone marrow cells covered the surface and filled the pores of PCL–HA scaffolds after 10 weeks in culture. Moreover, many cell-laden cartilage lacunae were observed, and cartilage matrix was concentrated in the PCL–HA scaffolds. After a 12-week repair period, Group 1 showed excellent vertical and lateral integration with host bone, but incomplete cartilage regeneration and matrix accumulation. An uneven surface of regenerated cartilage and reduced distribution of cartilage matrix were observed in Group 2. In addition, abnormal bone growth and unstable integration between repaired and host tissues were detected. For Group 3, the integration between transplanted and host cartilage was interrupted. Our findings indicate that the PCL–HA scaffolds loaded with bone marrow cells improved chondrogenesis in vitro and implantation of PCL–HA scaffolds for osteochondral repairenhanced integration with host bone. However, cartilage regeneration remained unsatisfactory. The addition of trophic factors or the use of precultured cell–PCL–HA constructs for accelerated osteochondral repair requires further investigation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/10763270260424187,Repair of Osteochondral Defect with Tissue-Engineered Two-Phase Composite Material of Injectable Calcium Phosphate and Hyaluronan Sponge,"Articular cartilage has limited capacity for repair. In the present study, tissue-engineered two-phase composite material was used for the repair of osteochondral defects in young adult rabbit knee. This composite material is composed of an injectable calcium phosphate (ICP) and a hyaluronan (HA) derivate of either ACP or HYAFF 11 sponge. The osteochondral defect, 3 mm in diameter and 3 mm deep, was created in the weight-bearing region of the medial femoral condyle. The bone portion of the defect was first filled with ICP to a level approximately 1 mm below the articular surface. HA sponge (3 mm in diameter and 1-1.2 mm thick), with or without loading of autologous bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (MPCs), was then inserted into the defect on top of the ICP as it hardened. Animals were allowed free cage activity postoperatively, and killed 4 or 12 weeks (for the HYAFF 11 sponge group) after the surgery. At 4 weeks, histological examination showed that the defect was filled up to 90-100% of its depth. Whitish repair tissue on the top appeared to be integrated with the surrounding articular cartilage. Four distinct zones of repair tissue were identified: a superficial layer, a chondroid tissue layer, an interface between HA sponge and ICP, and the ICP material. Evidence of extensive osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities was observed in the bone tissue surrounding the defect edge and in ICP material. By 12 weeks, the zonal features of the repair tissue became more distinct; chondrocytes were arranged in a columnar array, and a calcified layer of cartilage was formed beneath the chondroid tissue in some specimens. The healing tissue of the HA sponge material loaded with MPCs had higher cellular density and better integration with the surrounding cartilage than HA sponge material not loaded with MPCs. This study suggests that using a two-phase composite graft may hold potential for the repair of osteochondral defects by providing mechanical support that mimicks subchondral bone, while also providing a chondrogenic scaffold for the top cartilage repair.",0

The knee is most commonly involved, and without repair, patients have chronic knee pain, loose bodies, and early-onset osteoarthritis. There are a number of surgical techniques for repairing OCD, some of which are still being refined. Currently, common procedures used to treat OCD lesions include microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft transplantation, and osteochondral allograft transplantation. In this Technical Note, we describe osteochondral allograft transplantation with the addition of platelet-rich plasma and graft-recipient microfracture. We believe the micropores augment the osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties of the allograft and aid in the incorporation of the allograft plug by improving angiogenesis, enhancing clot formation in the allograft, and providing a homogeneous environment for remodeling.",0

The incongruity of plugs results in poor clinical outcomes, especially in cases of protuberance. However, a surgical procedure to deal with this problem has not been reported. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cartilage resection of elevated plugs, with the hypothesis that patients whose elevated plugs were resected and leveled would achieve clinical outcomes equivalent to those of patients with flush plugs. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Cases (group P) included 22 patients who underwent OAT of the knee and whose plugs showed protuberance greater than 1 mm that was resected with a scalpel to obtain smooth congruity, while controls (group C) included 22 background-matched patients who did not require plug resection. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score, IKDC objective grade, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for knee osteoarthritis (JOA knee score) were used preoperatively and at the final follow-up (mean ± SD, 49.3 ± 18.1 months). International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment was used to evaluate lesion healing during the second-look arthroscopy. Results: IKDC subjective scores of group C (82.5 ± 11.8) and group P (82.1± 15.1) showed no difference at the final follow-up. On postoperative IKDC objective grading, 86% of group C and 82% of group P patients were graded as “nearly normal” or better ( P = .639). The mean JOA knee scores of group C (90.9 ± 8.9) and group P (90.1 ± 9.5) did not differ significantly ( P = .647). Nine second-look arthroscopies were performed in group C versus 8 in group P, and all patients had plugs that were graded as “nearly normal” or better by the ICRS Cartilage Repair Assessment. Larger plugs tended to be used in those patients who required resection. Conclusion: Resection of the elevated plug surface did not negatively affect patient outcomes in the midterm follow-up period.",0

We created defects at the femoral condyle and implanted either scaffold A or B with chondrocytes or cell free. After 6 wk, animals were euthanized, we explanted the condyles, and evaluated them using histological, immunohistochemical, molecular biological, and histomorphometrical methods.Specimens with scaffold A showed severe lowering of the surface, and the defect size was larger than for scaffold B. We found more immune-competent cells around scaffold A. Chondrocytes were scarcely detected on the surface of both scaffolds. Histomorphometry of the interface between scaffold and recipient showed no significant difference regarding tissue of chondral, osseous, fibrous or implant origin or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed significant up-regulation for collagen II and SOX-9 messenger ribonucleic acid expression on the surface of scaffold B compared with scaffold A.Scaffold B proved to be stable and sufficiently integrated in the short term compared with scaffold A. More extensive evaluations with scaffold B appear to be expedient.",0

Hypothesis Hyaluronan-based scaffold seeded with autologous chondrocytes is a viable treatment for the damaged articular surface of the patellofemoral joint. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Among a group of 38 patients treated for full-thickness patellofemoral chondral lesions with second-generation ACI, we investigated 34 who were available for final follow-up at 5 years. These 34 had chondral lesions with a mean size of 4.45 cm 2 . Twenty-one lesions were located on the patella, 9 on the trochlea, and 4 patients had multiple lesions: 3 had patellar and trochlear lesions, and 1 had patellar and lateral femoral condyle lesions. Twenty-six lesions (76.47%) were classified as International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade IV A or B, 5 lesions (14.70%) were grade IIIC, and 3 (8.82%) were lesions secondary to osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). Results were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective and objective scores, EuroQol (EQ) visual analog scale (VAS), and Tegner scores at 2 and 5 years. Eight patients had second-look arthroscopy and biopsies. Results All the scores used demonstrated a statistically significant improvement ( P &lt; .0005) at 2 and 5 years’ follow-up. Objective preoperative data improved from 8 of 34 (23.52%) normal or nearly normal knees to 32 of 34 (94.12%) at 2 years and 31 of 34 (91.17%) at 5 years after transplantation. Mean subjective scores improved from 46.09 points preoperatively to 77.06 points 2 years after implantation and 70.39 at 5 years. The Tegner score improved from 2.56 to 4.94 and 4.68, and the EQ VAS improved from 56.76 to 81.47 and 78.23 at 2 and 5 years’ follow-up, respectively. A significant decline of IKDC subjective and Tegner scores was found in patients with multiple and patellar lesions from 2 to 5 years’ follow-up. Second-look arthroscopies in 8 cases revealed the repaired surface to be nearly normal with biopsy samples characterized as hyaline-like in appearance. Conclusion Hyaluronan-based scaffold seeded with autologous chondrocytes can be a viable treatment for patellofemoral chondral lesions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-016-4069-2,The role of meniscal tissue in joint protection in early osteoarthritis,"It is widely accepted that partial meniscectomy leads to early onset of osteoarthritis (OA). A strong correlation exists between the amount and location of the resected meniscus and the development of degenerative changes in the knee. On the other hand, osteoarthritic changes of the joint alter the structural and functional integrity of meniscal tissue. These alterations might additionally compromise the limited healing capacity of the meniscus. In young, active patients without cartilage damage, meniscus therapy including partial meniscectomy, meniscus suture, and meniscus replacement has proven beneficial effects in long-term studies. Even in an early osteoarthritic milieu, there is a relevant regenerative potential of the meniscus and the surrounding cartilage. This potential should be taken into account, and meniscal surgery can be performed with the correct timing and the proper indication even in the presence of early OA. Level of evidence IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-018-2944-7,Treatment of osteochondral defects with a combination of bone grafting and AMIC technique,"Osteochondral defects of the knee may cause functional impairment of young and sportively active patients. Different surgical treatment options have been proposed using either one or two step procedures. The aim of the current study was to evaluate mid-term outcomes of combined bone grafting with autologous matrix-associated chondrogenesis (AMIC) for the treatment of large osteochondral defects. 15 Patients with osteochondrosis dissecans of the medial femoral condyle grade III or IV according to ICRS classification were treated with a single step surgical procedure combining bone grafting and the AMIC procedure. Mean defect size was 4.98 cm(2) (+/- 3.02) and patients were examined at 6, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 month and at mean final follow-up of 49 months (36-61). Patients were evaluated using VAS, IKDC, KOOS, Lysholm, Tegner activity scores and psychological and physical health assessed using the SF 12. MRI evaluation was performed at final follow-up using the MOCART score. Pain had significantly decreased at final follow-up (7.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 2.6) compared to preoperative baseline. All functional scores had improved significantly throughout the follow-up period (IKDC from 36.6 +/- 20.6 vs. 72.2 +/- 18.7; KOOS 50.0 +/- 18.9 vs. 81.7 +/- 13.9; LYSHOLM 39.3 +/- 19.5 vs. 79.8 +/- 15.1). SF12 evaluation showed a significant increase in physical component summary (PCS) (31.2 +/- 11.1 preoperative vs. 46.3 +/- 9.9 at final follow-up), while mental component summary (MCS) remained stable (51.8 +/- 8.9 vs. 57.3 +/- 3.3). MOCART score revealed a mean overall score of 77 +/- 15 at final follow-up. Integration to the adjacent cartilage was complete in 79%, incomplete in 21%. Defect filling was complete in 64%, incomplete in 36%. Significant improvement of knee function and restoration of homogenous cartilage morphology could be achieved with simultaneous AMIC procedure and bone grafting in 2/3 of all patients with large osteochondral lesions at 4 years postoperatively.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.st.20.00055,Hybrid Bone-Grafting Technique for Staged Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Although most patients who undergo anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction achieve long-term functional stability and symptom relief, graft rupture rates range from 2% to 10%1,2. A small subset of these patients require a 2-stage revision ACL reconstruction because of tunnel osteolysis or tunnel malposition that will interfere with the planned revision tunnel placement3. In the present article, we describe the hybrid use of arthroscopically delivered injectable allograft matrix in the femur and pre-shaped bone dowels in the tibia for the treatment of lower-extremity bone deficiencies.After induction of anesthesia, approximately 60 cc of bone marrow aspirate is harvested from the anterior iliac crest with use of sterile techniques and is processed to obtain bone marrow aspirate concentrate. Routine diagnostic knee arthroscopy is performed via the standard anterolateral and anteromedial portals. Any additional intra-articular pathology is addressed, followed by excision of the remnant graft material, removal of existing femoral hardware as needed, and exposure of the existing bone tunnels. The femoral tunnel is debrided arthroscopically, removing all soft-tissue remnants. The existing tibial tunnel is exposed via the previous anteromedial tibial incision when possible. Again, any existing tibial hardware is removed. The tibial tunnel is then prepared with use of a combination of sequential reaming and dilation. A shaver and curets are utilized to debride the sclerotic walls of the tunnel and remove the remnant graft material. A cannulated allograft bone dowel is then impacted into place over a guidewire, ensuring that the graft is not proud within the joint space. An injectable bone allograft matrix composite is prepared by manually mixing 5 mL of StimuBlast demineralized bone matrix (Arthrex) and 5 mL of FlexiGraft cortical fibers (Arthrex), along with the previously obtained bone marrow aspirate concentrate. Under dry arthroscopy, this bone graft is delivered into the femoral tunnel via a cannula with use of the anteromedial portal. Finally, a Freer elevator is used to contour the graft at the aperture of the tunnel. Graft osteointegration is mandatory prior to proceeding with the second stage of the procedure. Typically, a minimum 3-month follow-up is necessary to confirm adequate graft incorporation on computed tomography.As an alternative to the 2-stage procedure, previous studies have suggested the use of a single-stage revision utilizing cylindrical allografts or multiple ""stacked screws.""4-6 In addition, a number of bone allograft and autograft options have been described. Autologous bone graft can be harvested from the ipsilateral iliac crest or proximal aspect of the tibia with use of a variety of techniques7-10. Allograft bone options include cancellous bone chips and commercially available bone matrices or dowels11-14. Finally, another viable option is calcium phosphate bone graft substitutes15. There is a paucity of high-quality studies comparing available bone graft materials for revision ACL reconstruction; thus, no consensus exists regarding the optimal choice16.A 2-stage approach is typically indicated for cases that demonstrate tunnel enlargement (>12 mm) that would compromise graft fixation or non-anatomic tunnel placement that will interfere with placement of the revision tibial tunnel3. The aim of the first stage is to re-establish adequate bone stock to optimize future tunnel placement and healing of the ACL graft during the second stage. We believe that this 2-stage approach is a reliable and safe method of treating enlarged, irregularly shaped bone tunnel defects while minimizing the risk of complications. Furthermore, the use of allograft material avoids the donor-site morbidity and volume limitations associated with the use of autograft bone. In the case of the femoral tunnel, the injectable bone graft composite has the advantage of being easily delivered arthroscopically while completely filling irregularly shaped tunnels. The use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate may improve the rate of graft healing as well as a hydrating substance to reduce viscosity and facilitate the flow of the bone graft material through the cannula16,17. For the tibia, especially in cases of lengthy tibial bone deficiencies, allograft bone dowels are commercially available off-the-shelf in a variety of different lengths and diameters to allow for adequate fill of bone defects.It is well known that outcomes following revision ACL reconstruction are inferior to those following primary ACL reconstruction, with a number of variables, beyond those associated with the surgical technique, influencing clinical outcomes18. Few studies have reported on the results of 2-stage revision ACL reconstruction with use of allograft bone; however, a high rate of allograft bone integration and improved bone quality at the time of revision ACL reconstruction have been reported13. Moreover, Mitchell et al. reported no differences in either subjective outcomes or failure rates between the 1-stage and 2-stage revision ACL reconstruction groups11.Utilize computed tomography for preoperative assessment and measurement of the extent of osteolysis.If possible, obtain the operative report for the index ACL procedure in order to identify any preexisting hardware and to obtain any instrumentation that may be needed to facilitate hardware removal.Multiple bone dowel sizes are available off the shelf.A 70° arthroscope can aid in visualization of the entire tibial and femoral tunnel.Although the bone graft matrix can be injected while the joint is filled with irrigation fluid, we find it easier to administer the graft under dry arthroscopic conditions.Place the scope inside the tibial tunnel to confirm appropriate removal of soft tissue and hardware. Circumferential native cancellous bone should be visualized.It is acceptable to retain previous hardware if it does not interfere with the new tunnel placement.Utilize prior incisions to access the tibial tunnel.Do not underestimate the amount of bone graft needed for each tunnel.Avoid excessive force during impaction of the dowels.ACLR = Anterior cruciate ligament reconstructionBMAC = Bone marrow aspirate concentrateMRI = Magnetic resonance imagingCT = Computed tomographyBTB = Bone-patellar tendon-boneDVT = Deep vein thrombosisROM = Range of motion.",0

Although well-established for cartilage defects in the knee, studies of the long-term outcomes of matrix-assisted ACI to treat cartilage defects in the ankle are rare. In the present report, we describe for the first time the long-term clinical and radiologic results 12 years after polymer-based matrix-assisted ACI treat a full-thickness talar cartilage defect in a 25-year-old male patient. The clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analog scale and Freiburg ankle score, magnetic resonance imaging evaluation using the Henderson-Kreuz scoring system and T2 mapping. Clinical assessment revealed improved visual analog scale and Freiburg ankle scores. The radiologic analysis and T2 relaxation time values indicated the formation of hyaline-like repair tissue. Polymer-based autologous chondrocytes has been shown to be a safe and clinically effective long-term treatment of articular cartilage defects in the talus.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465221074292,Comparison of 3 Cell-Free Matrix Scaffolds Used to Treat Osteochondral Lesions in a Rabbit Model,"Various cell-free scaffolds are already in use for the treatment of osteochondral defects (OCDs); however, a gold standard material has not yet been defined.This study compared the macroscopic, histological, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characteristics of Chondro-Gide (CG), MaioRegen (MA), and poly-d,l-lactide-co-caprolactone (PLCL) cell-free scaffolds enhanced with small-diameter microfractures (SDMs) for OCDs in a rabbit model.Controlled laboratory study.In total, 54 knees from 27 rabbits were used in this study. Three rabbits were sacrificed at the beginning of the study to form an intact cartilage control group (group IC). An OCD model was created at the center of the trochlea, and SDMs were generated in 24 rabbits. Rabbits with OCDs were divided into 4 groups (n = 12 knees per group) according to the cell-free scaffold applied: CG (group CG), MA (group MA), PLCL (group PLCL), and a control group (group SDM). Half of the rabbits were sacrificed at 1 month after treatment, while the other half were sacrificed at 3 months after treatment. Healed cartilage was evaluated macroscopically (using International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Preservation Society [ICRS] classification criteria) and histopathologically (using modified O'Driscoll scores and collagen staining). Additionally, cell-free scaffold morphologies were compared using SEM analysis.ICRS and modified O'Driscoll classification and staining with collagen type 1 and type 2 demonstrated significant differences among groups at both 1 and 3 months after treatment (P < .05). The histological characteristics of the group IC samples were superior to those of all other groups, except group PLCL, at 3 months after treatment (P < .05). In addition, the histological properties of group PLCL samples were superior to those of group SDM samples at both 1 and 3 months after treatment in terms of the modified O'Driscoll scores and type 1 collagen staining (P < .05). Concerning type 2 collagen staining intensity, the groups were ranked from highest to lowest at 3 months after treatment as follows: group PLCL (30.3 ± 2.6) > group MA (26.6 ± 1.2) > group CG (23.3 ± 2.3) > group SDM (18.9 ± 0.9).OCDs treated with enhanced SDM using cell-free PLCL scaffolds had superior histopathological and microenvironmental properties, more hyaline cartilage, and more type 2 collagen compared with those treated using CG or MA scaffolds.OCDs treated with PLCL cell-free scaffolds may have superior histopathological properties and contain more type 2 collagen than do OCDs treated with CG or MA cell-free scaffolds.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-006-0124-8,Mobilization of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into the injured tissues after intraarticular injection and their contribution to tissue regeneration,"The purpose of present study was to evaluate active mobilization effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into injured tissues after intraarticular injection of MSCs, and to evaluate their contribution to tissue regeneration. MSCs, which were obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and cultivated, were injected into normal SD rats in which multiple tissues had been injured including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial meniscus, and articular cartilage of the femoral condyles. At 4 weeks after injection Of MSCS, fluorescent microscopic observation, immunohistochemical or histological examinations were performed to evaluate mobilization of MSCs into injured tissue and their contribution to tissue regeneration. In the group of 1 X 10(6) MSCS injection, GFP positive cells could mobilize into the injured ACL alone in all 8 knees. In the group of 1 X 10(7) MSCs injection, GFP positive cells were observed in the injured site of ACL in all 8 knees and in the injured site of medial meniscus and cartilage of femoral condyles in 6 of 8 knees. More interestingly, extracellular matrix stained by toluidine blue was present around GFP positive cells in the injured femoral condyles cartilage and medial meniscus, indicating tissue regeneration. Intraarticularly injected MSCs could mobilize into the injured tissues, and probably contributed to tissue regeneration. This study demonstrated the possibility of intraarticular injection of MSCs for the treatment of intraarticular tissue injuries including ACL, meniscus, or cartilage. If this treatment option is established, it can be minimally invasive compared to conventional surgeries for these tissues.",0

Methods The CRD was press-fit into defects (10 mm diameter, 10 mm deep) created in the femoral trochlea of 12 horses. In the contralateral limb, 10 mm diameter full-thickness chondral defects were treated with microfracture (MFX). Radiographs were obtained pre- and postoperatively, and at 4, 12, and 24 months. Repeat arthroscopy was performed at 4 and 12 months. Gross assessment, histology, mechanical testing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at 24 months. Results The CRD was easily placed arthroscopically. There was no evidence of joint infection, inflammation, or degeneration. CRD-treated defects had significantly more sclerosis compared to MFX early ( P = 0.0006), but was not different at 24 months. CRD had better arthroscopic scores at 4 months compared to MFX ( P = 0.0069). At 24 months, there was no difference in repair tissue on histology or mechanical testing. Based on MRI, CRD repair tissue had less proteoglycan (deep P = 0.027, superficial P = 0.015) and less organized collagen (deep P = 0.028) compared to MFX. Cartilage surrounding MFX defects had more fissures compared to CRD. Conclusion The repair tissue formed after CRD treatment of a large osteochondral lesion is fibrocartilage similar to that formed in simple chondral defects treated with MFX. The CRD can be easily placed arthroscopically, is safe, and biocompatible for 24 months. The CRD results in improved early arthroscopic repair scores and may limit fissure formation in adjacent cartilage.",0

In 31 New Zealand White rabbits, a medial femoral condyle defect was created in each knee. After 4 weeks, 3 animals were killed for defect baseline values. In the other 28 rabbits, knees were sham-operated, treated with microfracturing, or treated by placing an oxidized zirconium (OxZr) or cobalt-chromium (CoCr) implant (theta articulating surface 3.5 mm; fixating pin of 9.1 mm length). These animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after treatment. Joints were evaluated macroscopically. Implant osseointegration was measured by automated histomorphometry, and cartilage repair was scored microscopically. Cartilage quality was analyzed macroscopically and microscopically. Bone-implant contact was 63.2% +/- 3.2% for CoCr and 62.5% +/- 3.2% for OxZr. Cartilage defects did not show complete healing, nor during subsequent sham-surgery or microfracturing. For all treatments, considerable cartilage damage in the articulating medial tibia, and degeneration of lateral tibial and femoral cartilage was observed (p < 0.05). Both CoCr and OxZr implant-treated defects showed an increase of cartilage degeneration compared to microfracturing and sham-operated defects (p < 0.05). Although only a single short-term follow-up period was investigated in this study, caution is warranted using small metal implants as a treatment for established localized cartilage defects because, even after 4 weeks in this model, the metal implants caused considerable degeneration of the articulating surface.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/rb/rbz023,An elastin-like recombinamer-based bioactive hydrogel embedded with mesenchymal stromal cells as an injectable scaffold for osteochondral repair,"Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate injectable, in situ cross-linkable elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) for osteochondral repair. Both the ELR-based hydrogel alone and the ELR-based hydrogel embedded with rabbit mesenchymal stromal cells (rMSCs) were tested for the regeneration of critical subchondral defects in 10 New Zealand rabbits. Thus, cylindrical osteochondral defects were filled with an aqueous solution of ELRs and the animals sacrificed at 4 months for histological and gross evaluation of features of biomaterial performance, including integration, cellular infiltration, surrounding matrix quality and the new matrix in the defects. Although both approaches helped cartilage regeneration, the results suggest that the specific composition of the rMSC-containing hydrogel permitted adequate bone regeneration, whereas the ELR-based hydrogel alone led to an excellent regeneration of hyaline cartilage. In conclusion, the ELR cross-linker solution can be easily delivered and forms a stable well-integrated hydrogel that supports infiltration and de novo matrix synthesis.",0

This study determines the prevalence of persistent edema-like signal intensity in OCT patients and evaluates the correlation between edema and morphological imaging findings of the graft and clinical pain symptoms.In this longitudinal observational study, 10 patients after OCT were followed by MRI prospectively 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post-operatively. All MR examinations were performed on a 1.0 T MR unit with the same protocol using a modified scoring system (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue-MOCART) for evaluation. Edema-like signal intensity in and beneath the osteochondral graft was assessed in its prevalence and graded using a coronal short tau inversion recovery fast spin echo (STIR-FSE) sequence: grade 1, normal; grade 2, moderate (diameter <2 cm); grade 3, severe (diameter >2 cm). The finding of edema-like signal intensity was correlated with graded parameters describing the morphology of the repair tissue assessed in a sagittal dual FSE sequence including: (a) surface of repair tissue: grade 1, intact; grade 2, damaged. (b) Cartilage interface: grade 1, complete; grade 2, incomplete. (c) Bone interface: grade 1, complete; grade 2, delamination. The finding of edema-like signal intensity was also correlated with the KOOS pain score assessing knee pain after 12 months.Initially, after 1 month the prevalence of edema-like signal intensity was 70% (7/10 patients) and finally after 24 months 60% (6/10 patients). We found no significant relationship between the prevalence and degree of edema-like signal intensity and parameters describing the morphology of the repair tissue. Also the clinical pain score did not show significant correlation with edema.Persistent bone marrow edema-like signal intensity in MRI is frequently found in patients after OCT and may post-operatively continue for years without significant relation to delamination and loss of the graft and knee pain.",0
https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20111122-07,Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation for Knee Cartilage Injuries: Moderate Functional Outcome and Performance in Patients With High-impact Activities,"Few studies have assessed the results of autologous chondrocyte implantation in patients with high-impact activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early functional outcome and activity level after 2-stage autologous chondrocyte implantation in professional soldiers and athletes. Nineteen patients with an average age of 32.2 years were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation and followed up for a minimum of 2 years. All patients except 2 had received previous arthroscopic treatment with debridement and/or microfracture. The mean size of the postdebridement defect was 6.54 cm2. Using Novocart technology (B. Braun-Tetec, Reutlingen, Germany), periosteal patch and matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation was sequentially performed with no randomization. The average subjective knee evaluation score and Lysholm score improved from 39.16 and 42.42, respectively, preoperatively to 62.4 and 69.4, respectively, at latest follow-up. Median Tegner activity score was 8.8 before injury, 3.8 preoperatively, and 6.15 at latest follow-up. Second-look arthroscopy was performed in 11 patients due to persistent pain, decreased range of movement, and mechanical symptoms. Six of 19 (31.5%) patients with professional or recreational athletic activities returned to preinjury levels of athletic performance.This study shows that mid-term results with autologous chondrocyte implantation in high-performance patients are not as good as have been reported with other similar technologies. Motivational issues during prolonged rehabilitation, multiple surgical interventions before autologous chondrocyte implantation, patient age, and large defects can potentially influence the outcome and overall performance in this selected group of patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1650-6,"Evaluation of subsidence, chondrocyte survival and graft incorporation following autologous osteochondral transplantation","The aim of this study was to evaluate subsidence tendency, surface congruency, chondrocyte survival and plug incorporation after osteochondral transplantation in an animal model. The potential benefit of precise seating of the transplanted osteochondral plug on the recipient subchondral host bone ('bottoming') on these parameters was assessed in particular.In 18 goats, two osteochondral autografts were harvested from the trochlea of the ipsilateral knee joint and inserted press-fit in a standardized articular cartilage defect in the medial femoral condyle. In half of the goats, the transplanted plugs were matched exactly to the depth of the recipient hole (bottomed plugs; n = 9), whereas in the other half of the goats, a gap of 2 mm was left between the plugs and the recipient bottom (unbottomed plugs; n = 9). After 6 weeks, all transplants were evaluated on gross morphology, subsidence, histology, and chondrocyte vitality.The macroscopic morphology scored significantly higher for surface congruency in bottomed plugs as compared to unbottomed reconstructions (P = 0.04). However, no differences in histological subsidence scoring between bottomed and unbottomed plugs were found. The transplanted articular cartilage of both bottomed and unbottomed plugs was vital. Only at the edges some matrix destaining, chondrocyte death and cluster formation was observed. At the subchondral bone level, active remodeling occurred, whereas integration at the cartilaginous surface of the osteochondral plugs failed to occur. Subchondral cysts were found in both groups.In this animal model, subsidence tendency was significantly lower after 'bottomed' versus 'unbottomed' osteochondral transplants on gross appearance, whereas for histological scoring no significant differences were encountered. Since the clinical outcome may be negatively influenced by subsidence, the use of 'bottomed' grafts is recommended for osteochondral transplantation in patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2717-3,Use of innovative biomimetic scaffold in the treatment for large osteochondral lesions of the knee,"Large osteochondral defects involve two different tissues characterized by different intrinsic healing capacity. Different techniques have been proposed to treat these lesions with results still under discussion. The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of 19 patients treated with a type I collagen-hydroxyapatite nanostructural biomimetic osteochondral scaffold at minimum follow-up of 2 years. Twenty lesions, 19 patients were treated with this scaffold implantation. The lesions size went from 4 to 8 cm(2) (mean size 5.2 +/- A 1.6 cm(2)). All patients were clinically evaluated using the International Repair Cartilage Society score, the Tegner Score and EQ-VAS. MRI was performed at 12 and 24 months after surgery and then every 12 months and evaluated with magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue scoring scale. The IKDC subjective score improved from a mean score of 35.7 +/- A 6.3 at the baseline evaluation to 67.7 +/- A 13.4 at 12-month follow-up (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005). A further improvement was documented from 12 to 24 months (mean score of 72.9 +/- A 12.4 at 24 months) (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005). The IKDC objective score confirmed the results. The Tegner activity score improvement was statistically significant (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005). The EQ-VAS showed a significant improvement from 3.15 +/- A 1.09 to 7.35 +/- A 1.14 (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005) at 2-year follow-up. The lesion' site seems to influence the results showing a better outcome in the patients affected in the medial femoral condyle. The use of the MaioRegen scaffold is a good procedure for the treatment for large osteochondral defects where other classic techniques are difficult to apply. It is an open one-step surgery with promising stable results at medium follow-up. IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-018-4025-5,Clinical and radiographical ten years long-term outcome of microfracture vs. autologous chondrocyte implantation: a matched-pair analysis,"PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and radiographical long-term outcome of microfracture (MFX) and first-generation periosteum-covered autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI-P). METHODS: All subjects (n = 86) who had been treated with knee joint ACI-P or microfracture (n = 76) with a post-operative follow-up of at least ten years were selected. Clinical pre- and post-operative outcomes were analyzed by numeric analog scale (NAS) for pain, Lysholm, Tegner, IKDC, and KOOS score. Radiographical evaluation was visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Assessment of the regenerate quality was performed by the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) and modified knee osteoarthritis scoring system (mKOSS). Relaxation time (RT) of T2 maps enabled a microstructural cartilage analysis. RESULTS: MFX and ACI of 44 patients (24 females, 20 males; mean age 38.9 ± 12.1 years) resulted in a good long-term outcome with low pain scores and significant improved clinical scores. The final Lysholm and functional NAS scores were significantly higher in the MFX group (Lysholm: MFX 82 ± 15 vs. ACI-P 71 ± 18 p = 0.027; NAS function: MFX 8.1 ± 3.5 vs. ACI-P 6.0 ± 2.5; p = 0.003). The MOCART score did not show any qualitative differences. KOSS analysis demonstrated that cartilage repair of small defects resulted in a significant better outcome. T2-relaxation times were without difference between groups at the region of the regenerate tissue. CONCLUSION: This study did not demonstrate coherent statistical differences between both cartilage repair procedures. MFX might be superior in the treatment of small cartilage defects.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1460-x,A comparative study of 3 different cartilage repair techniques,"The value of cell-free techniques in the treatment of cartilage defects remains under debate. In this study, cartilage repair of full-thickness chondral defects in the knees of Goettinger minipigs was assessed by treatment with a cell-free collagen type-I gel or a collagen type-I gel seeded with autologous chondrocytes. As a control, abrasion arthroplasty was included. In 18 adult Goettinger minipigs, three full-thickness chondral defects were created in one knee of the hind leg. They were either treated with a cell-free collagen gel, a collagen gel seeded with 2 x 10(5)/ml chondrocytes, or left untreated. All animals were allowed unlimited weight bearing. At 6, 12, and 52 weeks, 6 animals were sacrificed. Immediately after recovery, a non-destructive biomechanical testing was performed. The repair tissue quality was evaluated histologically, and the O'Driscoll score was calculated. After 6 weeks, a high number of cells migrated into the initially cell-free collagen gel. After 1 year, a hyaline-like repair tissue in both groups has been created. As assessed by O'Driscoll scoring and col-II staining, repair tissue quality of the initially cell-free gel was equal to defects treated by cell-seeded collagen gel implantation after 1 year. All untreated control defects displayed a fibrous repair tissue. The mechanical properties represented by the e-modulus were inconsistent in the course of the study. The implantation of a cell-free collagen type-I gel can lead to a high-quality repair tissue in the Goettinger minipig that equals a cell-based procedure after 1 year postoperatively. This study demonstrates the high chondrogenic potential of the applied collagen gel, which might help to overcome the disadvantages inherent in conventional cartilage tissue engineering methods.",0

Forty-eight hours later, all animals received MASIs of viable adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in an osteochondral defect of the right femur and mitomycin-pretreated apoptotic ADSCs in an osteochondral defect of the left femur. One additional control animal each received intravenous ferumoxytol and bilateral scaffold-only implants (without cells) or bilateral MASIs without prior ferumoxytol injection. All knees were imaged with a 7.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit with T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences immediately after, as well as 2 and 4 weeks after, matrix-associated stem cell implantation. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of viable and apoptotic MASIs were compared by using a linear mixed-effects model. MR imaging data were correlated with histopathologic findings.All ADSC implants showed a slowly decreasing T2 signal over 4 weeks after matrix-associated stem cell implantation. SNRs decreased significantly over time for the apoptotic implants (SNRs on the day of matrix-associated stem cell implantation, 2 weeks after the procedure, and 4 weeks after the procedure were 16.9, 10.9, and 6.7, respectively; P = .0004) but not for the viable implants (SNRs on the day of matrix-associated stem cell implantation, 2 weeks after the procedure, and 4 weeks after the procedure were 17.7, 16.2, and 15.7, respectively; P = .2218). At 4 weeks after matrix-associated stem cell implantation, SNRs of apoptotic ADSCs were significantly lower than those of viable ADSCs (mean, 6.7 vs 15.7; P = .0013). This corresponded to differential migration of iron-loaded macrophages into MASIs.Iron oxide loading of macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system by means of intravenous ferumoxytol injection can be utilized to monitor differential migration of bone marrow macrophages into viable and apoptotic MASIs in a rat model.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0737-z,Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation with Chondrosphere for Treating Articular Cartilage Defects in the Knee: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal,"Chondrosphere (Spherox) is a form of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). It is licensed for repair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and the patella of the knee with defect sizes up to 10 cm2 in adults. In a single technology appraisal (STA) [TA508] undertaken by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Warwick Evidence was the Evidence Review Group (ERG) invited to independently review the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, Co.Don. The clinical effectiveness data came from their COWISI randomised controlled trial (RCT), which compared Chondrosphere with microfracture (MF). The timing of this appraisal was unfortunate given that MF was no longer the most relevant comparator because NICE had contemporaneously published guidance approving ACI in place of MF. Moreover, the COWISI RCT enrolled mostly patients with small defect sizes. Evidence of clinical effectiveness for Chondrosphere used in people with larger defect size came from another RCT, which compared three doses of Chondrosphere and that by design could not provide evidence comparing Chondrosphere to any other forms of ACI. To estimate the relative clinical performance of Chondrosphere versus other ACI, Co.Don conducted an indirect treatment comparison by network meta-analyses (NMA). The NMA was flawed in that the distribution of population characteristics that are effect modifiers greatly differed across the treatment comparisons of the network. The ERG questioned both the appropriateness of the NMA and the validity of the resulting estimates. Co.Don estimated the cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere using a lifetime Markov model with all patients receiving the first repair during the first cycle of the model then moving into one of three health states: success, no further repair (NFR), or a second repair, if necessary. Subsequent to the first cycle, those who were a success either remained a success or moved to second repair. All those in NFR remained in NFR. The cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere compared to other ACI forms relied on the clinical effectiveness estimates of success and failure rates obtained from the company’s indirect comparisons, the validity of which the ERG questioned. The company revised cost-effectiveness estimates for Chondrosphere versus MF and for Chondrosphere versus matrix-applied characterised autologous cultured chondrocyte implant (MACI) were £4360 and around £18,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, respectively. NICE recommended ACI using Chondrosphere for treating symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and patella of the knee in adults only if certain requirements were met.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-015-2695-9,Short-term follow up after implantation of a cell-free collagen type I matrix for the treatment of large cartilage defects of the knee,"Purpose Although there are various new scaffold-based techniques for cartilage regeneration it remains unclear up to which defect size they can be used. The present study reports of a cell-free collagen type I gel matrix for the treatment of large cartilage defects of the knee after a two-year follow-up. Methods Twenty-eight patients with a mean cartilage defect size of 3.71 +/- 1.93 cmA(2) were treated with a cell-free collagen type I gel matrix (CaReS-1SA (R), Arthro Kinetics AG, Krems/Donau, Austria) via a mini-arthrotomy. Clinical outcome was assessed preoperatively and six weeks as well as six, 12 and 24 months after surgery using various clinical outcome scores (IKDC, Tegner, KOOS, VAS). Cartilage regeneration was evaluated via MRI using the MOCART score. Results Seventeen male and 11 female patients with a mean age of 34.6 years were included in this study. Significant pain reduction (VAS) could be noted after six weeks already. Patient activity (IKDC, Tegner) could be significantly improved from 12 months on and nearly reached reported pre-operative values. All subject categories of the KOOS except for symptom (swelling) showed significant improvements throughout the study. Constant significant improvements of the mean MOCART score were observed from 12 months on. MR images did not yield any signs of infection or synovitis. After 24 months a complete defect filling could be noted in 24 out of 28 cases with a mainly smooth surface, complete integration of the border zone and homogenous structure of the repaired tissue. Conclusion Cell-free collagen type I matrices appear to be a safe and suitable treatment option even for large cartilage defects of the knee. Results of this study were comparable to the better-established findings for small cartilage defects. Mid- and long-term results will be needed to see if clinical and MR-tomographic outcome can be maintained beyond 24 months.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00864,Simultaneous Recruitment of Stem Cells and Chondrocytes Induced by a Functionalized Self-Assembling Peptide Hydrogel Improves Endogenous Cartilage Regeneration,"The goal of treating articular cartilage (AC) injury is to regenerate cartilage tissue and to integrate the neo-cartilage with surrounding host cartilage. However, most current studies tend to focus on engineering cartilage; interface integration has been somewhat neglected. An endogenous regenerative strategy that simultaneously increases the recruitment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and chondrocytes may improve interface integration and cartilage regeneration. In this study, a novel functionalized self-assembling peptide hydrogel (KLD-12/KLD-12-LPP, KLPP) containing link protein N-peptide (LPP) was designed to optimize cartilage repair. KLPP hydrogel was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and rheometry. KLPP hydrogel shared a similar microstructure to KLD-12 hydrogel which possesses a nanostructure with a fiber diameter of 25-35 nm. In vitro experiments showed that KLPP hydrogel had little cytotoxicity, and significantly induced chondrocyte migration and increased BMSC migration compared to KLD-12 hydrogel. In vivo results showed that defects treated with KLPP hydrogel had higher overall International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scores, Safranin-O staining scores and cumulative histology scores than untreated defects or defects treated with KLD-12 hydrogel, although defects treated with KLD-12 and KLPP hydrogels received similar type II collagen immunostaining scores. All these findings indicated that the simple injectable functionalized self-assembling peptide hydrogel KLPP facilitated simultaneous recruitment of endogenous chondrocytes and BMSCs to promote interface integration and improve cartilage regeneration, holding great potential as a one-step surgery strategy for endogenous cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546521998006,Arthroscopic International Cartilage Repair Society Classification System Has Only Moderate Reliability in a Porcine Cartilage Repair Model,"Background: The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score was designed for arthroscopic use to evaluate the quality of cartilage repair. Purpose: To evaluate the reliability of the ICRS scoring system using an animal cartilage repair model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A chondral defect with an area of 1.5 cm 2 was made in the medial femoral condyle of 18 domestic pigs. Five weeks later, 9 pigs were treated using a novel recombinant human type III collagen/polylactide scaffold, and 9 were left to heal spontaneously. After 4 months, the pigs were sacrificed, then 3 arthroscopic surgeons evaluated the medial femoral condyles via video-recorded simulated arthroscopy using the ICRS scoring system. The surgeons repeated the evaluation twice within a 9-month period using their recorded arthroscopy. Results: The porcine cartilage repair model produced cartilage repair tissue of poor to good quality. The mean ICRS total scores for all observations were 6.6 (SD, 2.6) in arthroscopy, 5.9 (SD, 2.7) in the first reevaluation, and 6.2 (SD, 2.8) in the second reevaluation. The interrater reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the ICRS total scores (ICC, 0.46-0.60) and for each individual subscore (ICC, 0.26-0.71) showed poor to moderate reliability. The intrarater reliability with the ICC also showed poor to moderate reliability for ICRS total scores (ICC, 0.52-0.59) and for each individual subscore (ICC, 0.29-0.58). A modified Bland-Altman plot for the initial arthroscopy and for the 2 reevaluations showed an evident disagreement among the observers. Conclusion: In an animal cartilage repair model, the ICRS scoring system seems to have poor to moderate reliability. Clinical Relevance: Arthroscopic assessment of cartilage repair using the ICRS scoring method has limited reliability. We need more objective methods with acceptable reliability to evaluate cartilage repair outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.015,The use of de-differentiated chondrocytes delivered by a heparin-based hydrogel to regenerate cartilage in partial-thickness defects,"Partial-thickness cartilage defects, with no subchondral bone injury, do not repair spontaneously, thus there is no clinically effective treatment for these lesions. Although the autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is one of the promising approaches for cartilage repair, it requires in vitro cell expansion to get sufficient cells, but chondrocytes lose their chondrogenic phenotype during expansion by monolayer culture, leading to de-differentiation. In this study, a heparin-based hydrogel was evaluated and optimized to induce cartilage regeneration with de-differentiated chondrocytes. First, re-differentiation of de-differentiated chondrocytes encapsulated in heparin-based hydrogels was characterized in vitro with various polymer concentrations (from 3 to 20 wt.%). Even under a normal cell culture condition (no growth factors or chondrogenic components), efficient re-differentiation of cells was observed with the optimum at 10 wt.% hydrogel, showing the complete re-differentiation within a week. Efficient re-differentiation and cartilage formation of de-differentiated cell/hydrogel construct were also confirmed in vivo by subcutaneous implantation on the back of nude mice. Finally, excellent cartilage regeneration and good integration with surrounding, similar to natural cartilage, was also observed by delivering de-differentiated chondrocytes using the heparin-based hydrogel in partial-thickness defects of rabbit knees whereas no healing was observed for the control defects. These results demonstrate that the heparin-based hydrogel is very efficient for re-differentiation of expanded chondrocytes and cartilage regeneration without using any exogenous inducing factors, thus it could serve as an injectable cell-carrier and scaffold for cartilage repair. Excellent chondrogenic nature of the heparin-based hydrogel might be associated with the hydrogel characteristic that can secure endogenous growth factors secreted from chondrocytes, which then can promote the chondrogenesis, as suggested by the detection of TGF-β1 in both in vitro and in vivo cell/hydrogel constructs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2012.07.001,Arthroscopic Knee Cartilage Repair With Covered Microfracture and Bone Marrow Concentrate,"In recent years several single-stage cartilage repair approaches have been devised to treat focal cartilage lesions. These usually associate microfracture (MFX) and a coverage scaffold. We describe a novel arthroscopic technique that combines MFX, autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMC), and a protective scaffold. Bone marrow aspirate from the iliac crest is centrifuged to obtain BMC. The cartilage defect is debrided, MFX holes are created, and the final defect is measured by use of a bent K-wire. The scaffold is then shaped to match the defect, immersed in BMC, introduced into the joint with a grasper, and fixed in place with a mixture of fibrin glue and BMC. This technique aims to augment the original single-stage procedure with a number of mesenchymal stem cells and growth factors contained in the BMC, to increase the defect filling and the rate of hyaline-like cartilage regeneration. The procedure combining MFX, BMC, and a protective scaffold is inexpensive and reproducible and has already shown the ability to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage. Its use as an alternative to autologous chondrocyte implantation requires further investigation.",0
,Autologous chondrocyte implantation: a comparison between an open periosteal-covered and an arthroscopic matrix-guided technique.,"In this prospective study, the authors compared the Carticel method of autologous chondrocyte implantation with the Hyalograft C technique. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two methods, to identify any complications and to analyse MRI images of the repair process. Seventeen patients who had received autologous chondrocyte implantation with the Carticel technique and ten treated with Hyalograft C were assessed. A statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups at six months (p < 0.001 for Carticel and p = 0.002 for Hyalograft C) and at twelve months after surgery (p < 0.001 both for Carticel and Hyalograft C), according to HSS (Hospital for Special Surgery) and ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) scores. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. MRI images obtained one year after surgery revealed the formation of well-integrated tissue similar to the surrounding healthy cartilage in most cases, in both Carticel and Hyalograft C groups. Six patients treated with Carticel technique were also assessed by second-look arthroscopy and histology of biopsies. The newly-formed tissue presented structural features similar to normal cartilage in most cases (84%). Molecular analysis was performed to assess mRNA levels of the various collagen molecules and proliferation and differentiation factors: the results showed that the implanted material undergoes progressive remodelling to regenerate hyaline cartilage. Both Carticel and Hyalograft C implantation techniques seem to lead to comparable short- and medium-term results. Moreover, this study confirmed that MRI is a valid tool in the follow-up evaluation of autologous chondrocyte implantation.",1

Cell-based technology such as autologous chondrocyte implantation may in some cases provide durable cartilage repair, but availability of this procedure is often restricted due to cost constraints. There have been promising outcomes reported with the use of scaffolds seeded with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate in cases of chondral injury. There are clear advantages to cell-based cartilage repair techniques that are performed as a single-stage procedure, particularly when the repair technology can be used in a minimally invasive manner. We present an arthroscopic technique of cartilage repair using a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold associated with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate. This technique is a cost-effective, minimally invasive, single-stage procedure that has the potential for routine use in a wide range of cartilage lesion types and locations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967119867618,Chondrocytes From Device-Minced Articular Cartilage Show Potent Outgrowth Into Fibrin and Collagen Hydrogels,"Background: Transplantation of autologous minced cartilage is an established procedure to repair chondral lesions. It relies on the migration of chondrocytes out of cartilage particles into a biomaterial. So far, there is no efficient way to finely mince cartilage. No consensus exists on the nature of the biomaterial to be used to promote chondrocyte migration. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to investigate the potential clinical use of a custom-made mincing device as well as a possible alternative biomaterial to fibrin glue. The device was tested for its effect on chondrocyte viability and on subsequent chondrocyte migration into either a fibrin or a collagen gel. We hypothesized that device mincing would allow finer cutting and consequently more cell migration and that the gelation mechanism of the collagen biomaterial, which uses the clotting of platelet-rich plasma, would enhance matrix production by outgrown chondrocytes. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Cartilage from 12 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty was taken from the femoral condyles and subsequently either hand minced or device minced. The viability and the degree of outgrowth were quantified with live/dead assay on the generated cartilage particles and on the gels in which these particles were embedded, respectively. Matrix deposition in the biomaterials by the outgrown cells was investigated with histology. Results: The device allowed rapid mincing of the cartilage and produced significantly smaller pieces than hand mincing. The initial chondrocyte viability in cartilage particles dropped by 25% with device mincing as compared with no mincing. However, the viability in hand-minced, device-minced, and unminced samples was no longer different after 7 and 28 days in culture. Outgrowth scores were similar among the 3 groups. Fibrin and collagen biomaterials equally supported chondrocyte outgrowth and survival, but neither promoted matrix deposition after in vitro culture. Conclusion: The outgrowth potential, the viability after 28 days in culture, and the matrix deposition were not different between the mincing techniques and the tested biomaterials, yet device mincing is faster and results in significantly smaller cartilage particles. Clinical Relevance: Device mincing could become the standard method to mince cartilage for second-generation cartilage repair techniques.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-012-2466-5,Surgical Technique: Second-generation Bone Marrow Stimulation via Surgical Dislocation to Treat Hip Cartilage Lesions,"Compared to knees, hips have more bony constraint and soft tissue coverage. Thus, repair of focal cartilage defects in hips requires more invasive and technically complex surgeries than simple arthroscopy or arthrotomy. Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) is a second-generation bone marrow stimulation technique. Improvement in Tegner, Lysholm, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS), and Cincinnati scores has been reported at 1 and 2 years after AMIC in knees. AMIC is potentially useful to repair defects in hips, but it is unknown whether it relieves symptoms or results in a durable construct.A surgical hip dislocation is used to access the defect. This is débrided to stable cartilage shoulders, necrotic bone is removed, and the lesion base is drilled. Autogenous bone graft is used for lesions with bony defects to create a level surface. Fibrin gel and a collagen membrane are placed to stabilize the superclot for fibrocartilage formation.We treated six patients with AMIC in the hip between 2009 and 2010. We obtained Oxford Hip and UCLA Activity Scores. Repair quality was assessed on 6-month postoperative MRI using the modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system. Minimum 1-year followup data were available for four patients (range, 1-2.5 years).Postoperative Oxford Hip Scores ranged from 13 to 17, UCLA Activity Scores ranged from 5 to 10, and MOCART scores ranged from 55 to 75. No complications occurred.We describe AMIC in the hip. Although these patients had pain relief and improved function, long-term followup is necessary to assess the duration of improvement, durability of repair, and potential for arthrosis.Level IV, therapeutic study.

We conducted a systematic PRISMA review to evaluate clinical outcomes of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) and Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) injections for the treatment of focal chondral defects of the knee. Methods: A systematic review of literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines.

Here, to improve the cartilage characteristics of seed cells, a double biomimetic acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM)-oriented scaffold was used to mimic the cartilage microenvironment for human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs (hWJMSCs) and primary cartilage cells (pACs) to regenerate hyaline cartilage. Methods A double biomimetic ACECM-oriented scaffold was created from the cartilage extracellular matrix of pig articular cartilage using pulverization decellularization freeze-drying procedures. hWJMSCs and pACs were co-cultured at ratios of 50:50 (co-culture group, ACCC), 0:100 (ACAC group) and 100:0 (ACWJ group) in the ACECM-oriented scaffold, and the co-culture system was implanted in a caprine model for 6 months or 9 months to repair full-thickness articular cartilage defects. The control groups, which had no cells, comprised the blank control (BC) group and the ACECM-oriented scaffold (AC) group. Gross morphology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as histological and biomechanical evaluations were used to characterize the cartilage of the repair area. Results Relative to the control groups, both the gross morphology and histological staining results demonstrated that the neotissue of the ACCC group was more similar to native cartilage and better integrated with the surrounding tissue. Measurements of glycosaminoglycan content and Young’s modulus showed that the repair areas had more abundant cartilage-specific content and significantly higher mechanical strength in the ACCC group than in the control groups, especially at 9 months. On MRI, the T2-weighted signal of the repair area was homogeneous, and the oedema signal disappeared almost completely in the ACCC group at 9 months. HLA-ABC immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that hWJMSCs participated in the repair and regeneration of articular cartilage and escaped surveillance and clearance by the caprine immune system. Conclusion The structure and components of double biomimetic ACECM-oriented scaffolds provided a cartilage-like microenvironment for co-cultured seed cells and enhanced the biomechanics and compositions of neotissue. This co-culture system has the potential to overcome the dedifferentiation of passage chondrocytes and the unstable chondrogenic differentiation status of MSCs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-019-05418-1,CaAlg hydrogel containing bone morphogenetic protein 4-enhanced adipose-derived stem cells combined with osteochondral mosaicplasty facilitated the repair of large osteochondral defects,"Purpose Cartilage repair presents a challenge to clinicians and researchers. A more effective procedure that can produce hyaline-like cartilage is needed for articular cartilage repair. Mosaic osteochondral grafts for large osteochondral defects often show poor integration between the grafts and the surrounding normal cartilage, leading to defective cracks filled with fibrous tissue instead of hyaline-like cartilage. In the present study, we aimed to repair the defective cracks with a calcium alginate (CaAlg) hydrogel containing bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-enhanced adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Methods ADSCs were transduced with BMP4 (B-ADSCs). The expression of BMP4 and type II collagen was confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Swine models of large cartilage defects of the knee were constructed and received one of the four treatments: mosaicplasty only, mosaicplasty with the CaAlg hydrogel, mosaicplasty with the CaAlg hydrogel containing ADSCs, or mosaicplasty with the CaAlg hydrogel containing B-ADSCs injected into the defective cracks. Outcomes were evaluated at 12 and 24 weeks after surgery. Results The in vitro study showed that the osteogenic and chondrogenic activities of the B-ADSCs were enhanced compared with those of the control. In vivo, in the group that received mosaicplasty-containing B-ADSCs, osteochondral tissue was completely integrated with an intact surface. Additionally, the histological scores of the mosaicplasty-containing B-ADSCs group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. Biomechanical examination confirmed that the neocartilage possessed properties similar to those of normal cartilage. Conclusions Mosaicplasty and hydrogel containing B-ADSCs promoted the repair of large cartilage defects by regenerating hyaline cartilage and repairing dead spaces between osteochondral grafts and donor-site defects, thus improving the feasibility and success rate of one-stage complete repair surgery for large osteochondral defects. This proposed method provides a novel and effective means for the repair of large articular osteochondral defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-016-4323-7,Articular cartilage paste graft for severe osteochondral lesions of the knee: a 10- to 23-year follow-up study,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the articular cartilage paste graft procedure at a minimum of 10 years from surgery. It is hypothesized that articular cartilage paste grafting can provide patients with a durable repair of severe full-thickness osteochondral injuries, measured by persistence of procedure-induced benefit and subjective outcome scores at 10 or more years. Seventy-four patients undergoing paste grafting at a mean age of 45.3 +/- 10.8 years (range 13-69 years) were followed up at a mean of 16.8 +/- 2.4 years (range 10.6-23.2 years) post-operatively using validated subjective outcome measures; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate expected population benefit time. Kaplan-Meier estimated median benefit time of 19.1 years (mean: 16.6 +/- 0.9 years) for all patients undergoing paste grafting. Thirty-one (41.9 %) patients had progressed to arthroplasty at a mean of 9.8 +/- 5.6 years (range 0.4-20.6 years). Ninety percent of patients reported that the procedure provided good to excellent pain relief. Median IKDC subjective score increased significantly at most recent follow-up (70.1) compared to preoperative (55.7, p = 0.013). Median WOMAC scores decreased significantly from 26 to 14 (p = 0.001). Median Tegner score increase from 4 to 6 was not found to be significant (ns). VAS pain averaged 23/100 at most recent follow-up. Patients who underwent the paste grafting reported improved pain, function, and activity levels for an expected mean of 16.6 years, and for those who ultimately progressed to knee replacement, surgical treatment including the paste graft was able to delay arthroplasty until a mean age of 60.2 years, an age at which the procedure is commonly performed. Full-thickness articular cartilage loss can be successfully treated, reducing pain, and improving function, using this single-step, inexpensive arthroscopic procedure. IV.",0

Ergebnisse einer arthroskopischen Studie,"Zielstellung: Die hohe Tibiakopfosteotomie (HTO) stellt ein etabliertes Verfahren bei der Behandlung unikompartimenteller medialer Gonarthrosen dar. Diese Studie wurde mit dem Ziel durchgeführt, eine mögliche Knorpelregeneration nach HTO in Beziehung zu den bei der Indexoperation angewandten arthroskopischen Knorpeltherapieverfahren zu untersuchen. Dazu wurden 1,5 Jahre nach medial öffnender HTO im Rahmen der Metallentfernung Kontrollarthroskopien durchgeführt. Material und Methode: Bei 135 Patienten (72 Männer und 63 Frauen; Altersmittelwert 48,8 Jahre) erfolgte nach knöcherner Konsolidierung einer Opening-Wedge-HTO (1,5 Jahre) die Metallentfernung mit gleichzeitiger Kontrollarthroskopie. Die Schwere der Knorpelschäden wurde durch das ICRS-Schema (International Cartilage Repair Society) bestimmt. Ergebnisse: Bei ursprünglich Grad III konnte im Bereich des medialen Femurkondyls in 40,4 % und im Bereich des medialen Tibiaplateaus in sogar 62,3 % eine verbesserte Knorpelqualität festgestellt werden. Dagegen kam es in 13,1 % im Bereich des MFC und 8,5 % im Bereich des TM zu einer Verschlechterung der ursprünglichen Grad-III-Läsionen in einen kompletten Defekt (Grad-IV-Schaden). Am besten schnitten dabei diejenigen Patienten ab, bei denen im Verlauf der Indexoperation eine Thermoablation durchgeführt wurde. Alle kompletten Defekte wurden anlässlich der Indexoperation durch Mikrofrakturierung nach Steadman behandelt. In knapp ⅔ der ehemaligen Defekte am MFC und in etwa ⅓ der ehemaligen TM-Defekte wurde dabei im Verlauf der Kontrollarthroskopie eine Auffüllung der ehemaligen Defektzone mit in der Hakenprobe stabilen Regeneraten nachgewiesen. Schlussfolgerungen: Die medial öffnende HTO in Kombination mit einer arthroskopischen Knorpeltherapie erbringt einerseits ein gutes klinisches Outcome und andererseits kommt es bei einem Teil der Patienten zu einer partiellen Regeneration der geschädigten Knorpelflächen. Ein Zusammenhang zwischen klinischem Outcome und der Knorpelregeneration konnte jedoch nicht sicher nachgewiesen werden. Nach unseren Untersuchungen ist die klinische Verbesserung in erster Linie auf die Wiederherstellung physiologischer Achsverhältnisse zurückzuführen. Inwieweit die Knorpelregeneration möglicherweise aber das Langzeitresultat beeinflusst, bleibt ungewiss.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/os.12508,Effect of Cross‐Linked Hyaluronate Scaffold on Cartilage Repair: An <i>In Vivo</i> Study,"To determine the safety and effectiveness of a cross-linked sodium hyaluronate (CHA) scaffold in cartilage repair.Physicochemical properties of the scaffold were determined. The safety and effectiveness of the scaffold for cartilage repair were evaluated in a minipig model of a full-thickness cartilage defect with microfracture surgery. Postoperative observation and hematological examination were used to evaluate the safety of the CHA scaffold implantation. Pathological examination as well as biomechanical testing, including Young's modulus, stress relaxation time, and creep time, were conducted at 6 and 12 months postsurgery to assess the effectiveness of the scaffold for cartilage repair. Furthermore, type II collagen and glycosaminoglycan content were determined to confirm the influence of the scaffold in the damaged cartilage tissue.The results showed that the routine hematological indexes of the experimental animals were within the normal physiological ranges, which confirmed the safety of CHA scaffold implantation. Based on macroscopic observation, it was evident that repair of the defective cartilage in the animal knee joint began during the 6 months postoperation and was gradually enhanced from the central to the surrounding region. The repair smoothness and color of the 12-month cartilage samples from the operation area were better than those of the 6-month samples, and the results for the CHA scaffold implantation group were better than the control group. Greater cell degeneration and degeneration of the adjacent cartilage was found in the implantation group compared with the control group at both 6 and 12 months postoperation, evaluated by O'Driscoll Articular Cartilage Histology Scoring. Implantation with the CHA scaffold matrix promoted cartilage repair and improved its compression capacity. The type II collagen level in the CHA scaffold implantation group tended to be higher than that in the control group at 6 months (2.33 ± 1.50 vs 1.68 ± 0.56) and 12 months postsurgery (3.37 ± 1.70 vs 2.06 ± 0.63). The GAG content in the cartilage of the control group was significantly lower than that of the experimental group (2.17 ± 0.43 vs 3.64 ± 1.17, P = 0.002 at 6 months and 2.27 ± 0.38 vs 4.12 ± 1.02, P = 0.002 at 12 months). Type II collagen and glycosaminoglycan content also demonstrated that CHA was beneficial for the accumulation of both these vital substances in the cartilage tissue.The CHA scaffold displayed the ability to promote cartilage repair when applied in microfracture surgery, which makes it a promising material for application in the area of cartilage tissue engineering.",0
,[Osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) in the treatment of knee joint cartilage defects].,"Between 1998 and 2001 thirty-five patients underwent osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) and 35 patients (controls) - microfracture procedure for osteochondral or chondral knee joint pathology treatment. Average age of patients was 24.74+/-7.20 years. Patients were evaluated through International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) and modified Hospital for special Surgery (HSS) scales, arthroscopically, histologically, with MRI and x-rays. Modified HSS and ICRS evaluation showed statistically significantly better results in the mosaicplasty group 12 months post operation (p=0.005). Last follow-up showed deterioration in microfracture group (p=0.0005).",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.f.00299,Osteochondral Transplantation to Treat Osteochondral Lesions in the Elbow,"Effective treatment of osteochondral lesions in the elbow remains challenging. Arthroscopic débridement and microfracture or retrograde drilling techniques are often insufficient and provide only temporary symptomatic relief. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment of these lesions with osteochondral autografts.From 1999 to 2002, seven patients with osteochondral lesions of the capitellum humeri (five patients), trochlea (one patient), or radial head (one patient) were treated with cylindrical osteochondral grafts, which were harvested from the non-weight-bearing area of the proximal aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. The patients (three female and four male patients with an average age of seventeen years) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, with an average follow-up of fifty-nine months. The Broberg and Morrey score was chosen for functional evaluation of the elbow (with regard to motion, pain, strength, activities of daily living, and stability), and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was used for the analysis of pain. All patients had imaging studies done preoperatively to evaluate the defect and postoperatively to assess the ingrowth and viability of the graft. The ipsilateral knee was examined for donor-site morbidity.The Broberg and Morrey score improved from a mean (and standard deviation) of 76.3 +/- 13.2 preoperatively to 97.6 +/- 2.7 postoperatively, and pain scores were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The mean elbow extension lag of 4.7 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees was reduced to 0 degrees postoperatively. Compared with the contralateral side, there was a mean preoperative flexion lag of 12.9 degrees +/- 13.8 degrees . At the time of the final follow-up, flexion was free and was equal bilaterally in all patients. None of the plain radiographs made at the time of follow-up showed any degenerative changes or signs of osteoarthritis. The postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans showed graft viability and a congruent chondral surface in all seven patients. No donor-site morbidity was noted at one year postoperatively.The osteochondral autograft procedure described in the present study provides the opportunity to retain viable hyaline cartilage for the repair of osteochondral lesions in the elbow while restoring joint congruity and function and perhaps reducing the risk of osteoarthritis. These medium-term results suggest that the risks of a two-joint procedure are modest and justifiable. In addition, the described technique provides an option for revision surgery after the failure of other surgical procedures.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14051016,Regeneration of Articular Cartilage Using Membranes of Polyester Scaffolds in a Rabbit Model,"One promising method for cartilage regeneration involves combining known methods, such as the microfracture technique with biomaterials, e.g., scaffolds (membranes). The most important feature of such implants is their appropriate rate of biodegradation, without the production of toxic metabolites. This study presents work on two different membranes made of polyester (L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone-PLCA) named “PVP and “Z”. The difference between them was the use of different pore precursors—polyvinylpyrrolidone in the “PVP” scaffold and gelatin in the “Z” scaffold. These were implemented in the articular cartilage defects of rabbit knee joints (defects were created for the purpose of the study). After 8, 16, and 24 weeks of observation, and the subsequent termination of the animals, histopathology and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) examinations were performed. Statistical analysis proved that the membranes support the regeneration process. GPC testing proved that the biodegradation process is progressing exponentially, causing the membranes to degrade at the appropriate time. The surgical technique we used meets all the requirements without causing the membrane to migrate after implantation. The “PVP” membrane is better due to the fact that after 24 weeks of observation there was a statistical trend for higher histological ratings. It is also better because it is easier to implant due to its lower fragility then membrane “Z”. We conclude that the selected membranes seem to support the regeneration of articular cartilage in the rabbit model.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2008.01.041,Autologous osteochondral grafting—Technique and long-term results,"Efficacious treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects of weightbearing articular surfaces is a daily challenge in musculoskeletal care. Autogenous osteochondral transplantation represents a possible solution for creating hyaline or hyaline-like repair in the affected area that has a noninflammatory pathoorigin. This paper discusses the experimental background and over 15 years of clinical experience with autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty.Several series of animal studies and subsequent clinical practice of over 1,000 mosaicplasty patients were assessed to confirm the survival of transplanted hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage filling of donor sites located on relatively less weightbearing surfaces, as well as donor-site disturbances and morbidity. Histological evaluations of dog and horse implantations as well as several series of clinical evaluations in the human material are summarized in this paper. Clinical scores, different types of imaging techniques, second-look arthroscopies, histological examination of biopsy samples, and cartilage stiffness measurements were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes and quality of the transplanted cartilage.Analysis of clinical scores has shown good to excellent results in 92% of patients with femoral condylar implantations, 87% of tibial resurfacements, 74% of patellar and/or trochlear mosaicplasties and 93% of talar procedures. Longterm donor-site complaints measured by the Bandi score were minor and present only in 3% of patients. 81 out of the 98 control arthroscopies represented congruent and good gliding surfaces and histologically proven survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage as well as fibrocartilage covering of the donor sites. Complications in the entire patient group were four deep infections and four deep venous thromboses. In nearly 8% of the cases excessive intraarticular bleeding was observed in the early postoperative period, as a minor complication of the procedure. Multicentric, comparative, prospective evaluation of 413 arthroscopic resurfacing procedures (mosaicplasty, Pridie drilling, abrasion arthroplasty and microfracture cases in homogenised subgroups) demonstrated that mosaicplasty resulted in favourable clinical outcome in the long-term follow-up compared to other three techniques. Durability of the early results was confirmed in long-term evaluations both of the femoral condylar implantations and talar mosaicplasties.According to our encouraging results in this increasingly large series, supported by similar findings from other centres, it seems that autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty may be an alternative for small and medium-sized focal chondral and osteochondral defects of weightbearing surfaces of the knee and other weightbearing synovial joints.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2012.11.017,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Injections Improve Symptoms of Knee Osteoarthritis,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and imaging results of patients who received intra-articular injections of autologous mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.The study group comprised 18 patients (6 men and 12 women), among whom the mean age was 54.6 years (range, 41 to 69 years). In each patient the adipose synovium was harvested from the inner side of the infrapatellar fat pad by skin incision extension at the arthroscopic lateral portal site after the patient underwent arthroscopic debridement. After stem cells were isolated, a mean of 1.18 × 10(6) stem cells (range, 0.3 × 10(6) to 2.7 × 10(6) stem cells) were prepared with approximately 3.0 mL of platelet-rich plasma (with a mean of 1.28 × 10(6) platelets per microliter) and injected into the selected knees of patients. Clinical outcome was evaluated with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, the Lysholm score, and the visual analog scale (VAS) for grading knee pain. We also compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected both preoperatively and at the final follow-up.Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores decreased significantly (P < .001) from 49.9 points preoperatively to 30.3 points at the final follow-up (mean follow-up, 24.3 months; range, 24 to 26 months). Lysholm scores also improved significantly (P < .001) by the last follow-up visit, increasing from a mean preoperative value of 40.1 points to 73.4 points by the end of the study. Likewise, changes in VAS scores throughout the follow-up period were also significant (P = .005); the mean VAS score decreased from 4.8 preoperatively to 2.0 at the last follow-up visit. Radiography showed that, at the final follow-up point, the whole-organ MRI score had significantly improved from 60.0 points to 48.3 points (P < .001). Particularly notable was the change in cartilage whole-organ MRI score, which improved from 28.3 points to 21.7 points (P < .001). Further analysis showed that improvements in clinical and MRI results were positively related to the number of stem cells injected.The results of our study are encouraging and show that intra-articular injection of infrapatellar fat pad-derived mesenchymal stem cells is effective for reducing pain and improving knee function in patients being treated for knee osteoarthritis.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.20419,Regional multilineage differentiation potential of meniscal fibrochondrocytes: Implications for meniscus repair,"The knee menisci are wedge-shaped semilunar fibrocartilaginous structures that reside between the femur and tibia and function to transmit and distribute load. These structures have characteristics of both fibrous and cartilaginous tissues. The cartilage-like inner region and the fibrous vascularized outer region each has a distinct extracellular matrix, and resident meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs) with distinct morphologies dependent on their location. Damage to the meniscus is common, and disruption of tissue structure and function result in erosion of the underlying articular cartilage. It has been observed that damage in the vascular periphery undergoes spontaneous repair, whereas damage of the inner region does not heal. While vascularity of the peripheral region plays a role in healing, recent findings have also suggested that local cellular composition influences local healing capacity. This study examined the variation in multipotential characteristics of cell populations isolated from different regions of the bovine meniscus. MFCs were isolated from the outer (vascular), inner (avascular), and horn (mixed) regions and induced toward chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic lineages. The results of this study suggest that MFCs from all regions of the meniscus possess a multilineage differentiation capability, particularly toward chondrogenesis and adipogenesis. MFCs from the outer region were most plastic, differentiating along all three mesenchymal lineages. These findings may underlie the experimental observation of improved integration of meniscus grafts from the outer zone and may have implications for developing strategies of cell-based meniscus repair.",0

Recently, an aragonite-hyaluronate (Ar-HA) biphasic scaffold has been described capable of cartilage regeneration over a 6-month follow-up period. This study was conducted in order to assess the fate of the regenerated osteochondral tissue in a 12-month-long validated caprine model.The hypothesis was that the implantation of the Ar-HA implant leads to tissue regeneration and maturation.A two-arm caprine model of a critical osteochondral defect compares the fate of acute osteochondral defects (group A) to Ar-HA implanted defects (group B).Critical 6 mm in diameter and 10-mm in depth osteochondral defects were created in the load-bearing medial femoral condyle of 20 mature goats and randomized into two groups. In group A (n = 6), a blood clot spontaneously filled the defect; in group B (n = 14), a single Ar-HA implant reconstructed the defect. The animals were sacrificed after either 6 or 12 months. Parameters assessed included clinical evaluation, x-rays, micro-CT, ultrasound and histology at both time points, and specimen high-field magnetic resonance imaging with T2 mapping at the 12-month time point.In most group A animals, the defects were not reconstructed (1/3 at 6 months, and 0/3 at 12 months). Defects in group B were mostly reconstructed (5/7 at 6 months and 6/7 at 12 months). Group A defects were either empty or contained fibrous repair tissue; while group B filling was compatible with hyaline cartilage and normal bone.Ar-HA scaffolds implanted in critical osteochondral defects result in hyaline cartilage formation and subchondral bone regeneration. The results improved at the 12-month time point compared to the 6-month time point, indicating a continuous maturation process without deterioration of the repair tissue.Osteochondral defects are common in humans; the results of the current study suggest that an acellular Ar-HA scaffold might induce cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546514538756,Graft Maturation of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) using tissue-engineered cartilage is a successful therapy for full-thickness cartilage lesions in the knee joint. However, in vivo graft maturation is still unclear. Purpose: The aim of this prospective study was to analyze graft maturation after ACI in the knee using objective T2 mapping in correlation with the clinical outcomes within a 3-year postoperative course. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 13 patients with isolated cartilage defects of the knee were treated with Novocart 3D, a matrix-based ACI procedure in the knee joint. The patients had complete data from International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores and MRI examinations for 6 to 36 months postoperatively. All cartilage defects were arthroscopically classified as Outerbridge grades III and IV. The mean area of the cartilage defect was 5.6 cm 2 . Postoperative clinical and MRI examinations were conducted at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery. The modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was used to evaluate the quality and integration of the Novocart 3D implants on MRI. The T2 relaxation time values of the ACI graft and healthy native cartilage areas were determined to assess graft maturation using T2 mapping. Results: The T2 relaxation times of the ACI graft showed significant improvement, with decreasing values from 41.6 milliseconds at 6-month follow-up to 32.4 and 30.9 milliseconds after 24 and 36 months, respectively. These values were similar to the T2 relaxation times of the native surrounding cartilage. There was no correlation between the clinical outcomes (IKDC score) and T2 relaxation time values. Conclusion: The T2 relaxation time in the repaired tissue showed similar values compared with normal hyaline cartilage. Graft maturation after ACI in the knee joint needs at least 1 year, with ongoing adjustment of the T2 relaxation time values compared with native surrounding cartilage. A correlation between increasing ACI graft maturation and clinical outcomes (IKDC score) could not be found with the data available.",0

The keyword search included the following: ""autologous chondrocyte,"" ""cartilage graft,"" ""cartilage repair,"" ""chondroplasty,"" ""microfracture,"" ""mosaicplasty,"" and/or ""osteochondral."" Nonoperative studies, nonhuman studies, ex vivo studies, non-knee studies, and/or studies with follow-up of less than 1 year were excluded. A systematic review was performed on all included studies, and limitations and/or biases were identified and quantitated.Of 15,311 citations, 33 abstracts were reviewed and 11 prospective, randomized controlled trials were included. We identified 9 major limitations (subject age, subject prior surgery, subject duration of symptoms, lesion location, lesion size, lesion number, procedure selection, procedure standardization, and limited histologic analysis) and 7 common biases (selection, performance, transfer, nonresponder, detection, publication, and study design).Level I therapeutic studies investigating the surgical management of human knee cartilage defects have substantial identified biases and limitations. This review has limitations because other classifications of bias or limitation exist. Optimal management of cartilage defects is controversial, and future rigorous research methods could minimize common biases through strict study design and patient selection criteria, larger patient enrollment, more extended follow-up, and standardization of clinical treatment pathways.Level I, systematic review of Level I studies.",0
,Current cell-based strategies for knee cartilage injuries.,Cartilage is frequently damaged and shows little or no capacity for repair. Injuries that extend to the subchondral level show some capacity for repair due to the release of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells. This technique is employed in techniques like the microfracture but they are only appropriate for smaller cartilage defects. Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) and Matrix-carried Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI) are currently used in clinical practice to treat larger full thickness chondral defects in the knee with similar results. MACI does however have a number of advantages including its amenability to be performed arthroscopically or through a more limited approach without requiring arthrotomy. More definitive studies showing the long-term effects of the two cell-based treatments and comparing them are however awaited. There are a small number of studies using mesenchymal stem cells and further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed before this treatment is optimised. This review discussed these treatment options and provides an evidence-based approach to current clinical treatments.,0

One hundred and five OATS cylinders were implanted. MR findings consistent with osteonecroses were detected in eight cylinders (n=6 in the knee and n=2 in the ankle) in six patients; four out of eight were demonstrated during the first year and four/eight in the second year. Edema around and/or in the cylinders was found in 28/55 of the patients within the first year, five/30 in the second year and in two/13 in the third year. No substantial changes in the cartilage signal intensity or the cartilage-cartilage interface were demonstrated in the longitudinal follow-up within the first three years. Clinical and MR findings were not consistently associated in particular in the patients with osteochondral autograft necroses.",0

An alternative may be to use mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). We have compared articular chondrocytes with MSC from human bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT), all cultured in HA scaffolds, for their ability to express genes and synthesize proteins associated with chondrogenesis. The cells were expanded in monolayer cultures. After seeding into the scaffold, the chondrocytes were maintained in medium, while the two MSC populations were given a chondrogenic differentiation medium. Chondrogenesis was assessed by real-time RT-PCR for chondrocyte-associated genes, by immunohistochemistry and by ELISA for collagens in the supernatant. Redifferentiation of the dedifferentiated chondrocytes in the HA scaffold was shown by a modest increase in type II collagen mRNA (COL2A1) and reduction in COL1A1. BM-MSC expressed 600-fold higher levels of COL2A1 than chondrocytes after 3 weeks in the scaffold. The levels of aggrecan (AGC1) and COL1A1 were similar for chondrocyte and BM-MSC scaffold cultures, while COL10A1 was higher in the BM-MSC. AT-MSC expressed levels of COL2A1 and COL1A1 similar to chondrocytes, but less AGC1 and COL10A1. Surprisingly, little collagen II protein was observed in the scaffold. Instead, collagen II was found in the culture medium. Chondrogenesis in HA scaffolds was more efficient using BM-MSC than AT-MSC or chondrocytes. Some of the secreted collagen II escaped entrapment in the extracellular space and was detected in the culture medium.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603520946382,The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis for Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus: Analyzing MOCART 1 and 2.0,"Objective To determine the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) 1 and 2.0 scores in the assessment of postoperative outcome after autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs). It was hypothesized that preoperative patient factors or OLT morphology are associated with postoperative MOCART scores; yet postoperative clinical outcome is not. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 4. This study evaluated isolated AMIC that were implanted on the talus of 35 patients for the treatment of symptomatic OLT. Tegner and AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) scores were obtained at an average follow-up of 4.5 ± 1.8 years and postoperative MRI scored according to the MOCART 1 and 2.0. Results OLT size showed significant correlation with postoperative MRI scores (MOCART 1: P = 0.006; MOCART 2.0: P = 0.004). Bone grafting was significantly associated with a MOCART 1 subscale (signal intensity of repair tissue; P = 0.038). Age and defect size showed significant correlations with MOCART 2.0 subscales ( P &lt; 0.05). Patients with shorter follow-up had a significantly higher MOCART 1 score and a trend toward better MOCART 2.0 scores than patients with longer follow-up (64.7 vs. 52.9 months, P = 0.02; 69.4 vs. 60.6 months, P = 0.058). No MOCART score was associated with postoperative patient-reported outcomes (n.s.). Conclusion Osteochondral lesion size is associated with postoperative MOCART scores in patients treated with AMIC for OLTs, with decreasing MOCART scores over time. Yet clinical outcome does not correlate with any MOCART score. Thus, MOCART assessment seems to have no significant role in the postoperative treatment of asymptomatic patients that underwent AMIC for OLTs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2484-1,Cartilage repair in the knee with subchondral drilling augmented with a platelet-rich plasma-immersed polymer-based implant,"The aim of our study was to analyse the clinical and histological outcome after the treatment of focal cartilage defects in non-degenerative and degenerative knees with bone marrow stimulation and subsequent covering with a cell-free resorbable polyglycolic acid-hyaluronan (PGA-HA) implant immersed with autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Fifty-two patients (mean age 44 years) with focal chondral defects in radiologically confirmed non-degenerative or degenerative knees were subjected to subchondral drilling arthroscopically. Subsequently, defects were covered with the PGA-HA implant immersed with autologous PRP. At 2-year follow-up, the patients' situation was assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and compared to the pre-operative situation and 3-12-month follow-up. Biopsies (n = 4) were harvested at 18-24 months after implantation and were analysed by histology and collagen type II immune staining. At 1- and 2-year follow-up, the KOOS showed clinically meaningful and significant (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) improvement in all subcategories compared to baseline and to 3-month follow-up. There were no differences in KOOS data obtained after 2 years compared to 1 year after the treatment. Histological analysis of the biopsy tissue showed hyaline-like to hyaline cartilage repair tissue that was rich in cells with a chondrocyte morphology, proteoglycans and type II collagen. Covering of focal cartilage defects with the PGA-HA implant and PRP after bone marrow stimulation improves the patients' situation and has the potential to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546508330137,Increased Failure Rate of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation after Previous Treatment with Marrow Stimulation Techniques,"Background Marrow stimulation techniques such as drilling or microfracture are first-line treatment options for symptomatic cartilage defects. Common knowledge holds that these treatments do not compromise subsequent cartilage repair procedures with autologous chondrocyte implantation. Hypothesis Cartilage defects pretreated with marrow stimulation techniques will have an increased failure rate. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods The first 321 consecutive patients treated at one institution with autologous chondrocyte implantation for full-thickness cartilage defects that reached more than 2 years of follow-up were evaluated by prospectively collected data. Patients were grouped based on whether they had undergone prior treatment with a marrow stimulation technique. Outcomes were classified as complete failure if more than 25% of a grafted defect area had to be removed in later procedures because of persistent symptoms. Results There were 522 defects in 321 patients (325 joints) treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation. On average, there were 1.7 lesions per patient. Of these joints, 111 had previously undergone surgery that penetrated the subchondral bone; 214 joints had no prior treatment that affected the subchondral bone and served as controls. Within the marrow stimulation group, there were 29 (26%) failures, compared with 17 (8%) failures in the control group. Conclusion Defects that had prior treatment affecting the subchondral bone failed at a rate 3 times that of nontreated defects. The failure rates for drilling (28%), abrasion arthroplasty (27%), and microfracture (20%) were not significantly different, possibly because of the lower number of microfracture patients in this cohort (25 of 110 marrow-stimulation procedures). The data demonstrate that marrow stimulation techniques have a strong negative effect on subsequent cartilage repair with autologous chondrocyte implantation and therefore should be used judiciously in larger cartilage defects that could require future treatment with autologous chondrocyte implantation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064569,A Novel Biological Approach to Treat Chondromalacia Patellae,"Mesenchymal stem cells from several sources (bone marrow, synovial tissue, cord blood, and adipose tissue) can differentiate into variable parts (bones, cartilage, muscle, and adipose tissue), representing a promising new therapy in regenerative medicine. In animal models, mesenchymal stem cells have been used successfully to regenerate cartilage and bones. However, there have been no follow-up studies on humans treated with adipose-tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the chondromalacia patellae. To obtain ADSCs, lipoaspirates were obtained from lower abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. The stromal vascular fraction was separated from the lipoaspirates by centrifugation after treatment with collagenase. The stem-cell-containing stromal vascular fraction was mixed with calcium chloride-activated platelet rich plasma and hyaluronic acid, and this ADSCs mixture was then injected under ultrasonic guidance into the retro-patellar joints of all three patients. Patients were subjected to pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Pre- and post-treatment subjective pain scores and physical therapy assessments measured clinical changes. One month after the injection of autologous ADSCs, each patient's pain improved 50-70%. Three months after the treatment, the patients' pain improved 80-90%. The pain improvement persisted over 1 year, confirmed by telephone follow ups. Also, all three patients did not report any serious side effects. The repeated magnetic resonance imaging scans at three months showed improvement of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages) on the patellae-femoral joints. In patients with chondromalacia patellae who have continuous anterior knee pain, percutaneous injection of autologous ADSCs may play an important role in the restoration of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages). Thus, ADSCs treatment presents a glimpse of a new promising, effective, safe, and non-surgical method of treatment for chondromalacia patellae.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-014-2403-1,Five-year results of arthroscopic techniques for the treatment of acetabular chondral lesions in femoroacetabular impingement,"This study assesses and compares the clinical outcomes of the arthroscopic matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI) and autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) techniques for the treatment of acetabular chondral defects between 2 and 4 cm(2) consequent to femoral acetabular impingement.Fifty-seven consecutive patients were treated with the MACI (n = 26) or AMIC (n = 31) technique. Patients were assessed pre-operatively and up to five years using the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) to compare outcomes.In both the MACI and AMIC groups, significant hip score improvements were measured over baseline levels at six months post-op (81.2 ± 8.4 for MACI, 80.3 ± 8.3 for AMIC, both p < 0.001). The mHHS continued to improve up to three years post-op and remained stable over time until the final five year follow-up. Statistically significant differences between the groups were not observed. The mean mHHS improvement at the five year follow-up with respect to preoperative level was 37.8 ± 5.9 and 39.1 ± 5.9 in patients who underwent MACI and AMIC, respectively (NS). Subgroup analysis of both MACI and AMIC treatment outcomes for patients with an initial chondral defect larger than 3 cm(2) yielded comparable results at each time point.This study suggests that both arthroscopic MACI and AMIC are valid procedures to repair medium-sized chondral defects on the acetabular side of the hip found during treatment of femoroacetabular impingement. Due to its high sustainability and minimal invasiveness, the single-stage AMIC procedure can reduce total treatment time and minimise morbidity while providing the same beneficial effects as the two-stage MACI intervention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00393-002-0408-4,Perspektiven der operativen Behandlung von Gelenkknorpeldefekten,"The high clinical and socio-economical impact of cartilage defects and chondral degeneration is well known. A golden standard for the treatment of cartilage defects does not exist. Superficial lacerations of the joint cartilage do not have a tendency toward self healing but seem to stay stationary in many cases. Full thickness cartilage defects down to the subchondral bone plate or beyond have a proven tendency toward progression and therefore require a specific treatment. Since joint instability and unphysiological joint axes are cofactors for cartilage lesions, deformities and instability have to be corrected prior to cartilage-specific treatment. Various techniques for the regeneration of articular cartilage promise a physiological repair of even full thickness defects. Bone marrow stimulating procedures such as drilling, abrasion and microfracture induce the ingrowth of stemcells and fibroblasts into the defect with the anticipated result of a cartilage regeneration with fibrous tissue. To synthesize hyaline cartilage matrix, autologous chondrocytes are cultured in vitro before being delivered into cartilage defects under a periostal flap Autologous chondrocyte implantation has shown promising clinical results for up to 10 years. Osteochondral transplantations (e.g., mosaicplasty) do not represent a cartilage regeneration technique but are widely used for the treatment of smaller defects. New developments regarding the delivery of cells, e.g., in bioresorbable scaffolds enable the arthroscopic implantation of cultured cells.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tec.2016.0033,Autologous Bone Marrow Concentrate in a Sheep Model of Osteoarthritis: New Perspectives for Cartilage and Meniscus Repair,"Cell-based therapies are becoming a valuable tool to treat osteoarthritis (OA). This study investigated and compared the regenerative potential of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), both engineered with Hyaff(®)-11 (HA) for OA treatment in a sheep model.OA was induced via unilateral medial meniscectomy. Bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest, followed by concentration processes or cell isolation and expansion to obtain BMC and MSC, respectively. Treatments consisted of autologous BMC and MSC seeded onto HA. The regenerative potential of bone, cartilage, menisci, and synovia was monitored using macroscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and micro-computed tomography at 12 weeks post-op. Data were analyzed using the general linear model with adjusted Sidak's multiple comparison and Spearman's tests.BMC-HA treatment showed a greater repair ability in inhibiting OA progression compared to MSC-HA, leading to a reduction of inflammation in cartilage, meniscus, and synovium. Indeed, the decrease of inflammation positively contributed to counteract the progression of fibrotic and hypertrophic processes, known to be involved in tissue failure. Moreover, the treatment with BMC-HA showed the best results in allowing meniscus regeneration. Minor healing effects were noticed at bone level for both cell strategies; however, a downregulation of subchondral bone thickness (Cs.Th) was found in both cell treatments compared to the OA group in the femur.The transplantation of BMC-HA provided the best effects in supporting regenerative processes in cartilage, meniscus, and synovium and at less extent in bone. On the whole, both MSC and BMC combined with HA reduced inflammation and contributed to switch off fibrotic and hypertrophic processes. The observed regenerative potential by BMC-HA on meniscus could open new perspectives, suggesting its use not only for OA care but also for the treatment of meniscal lesions, even if further analyses are necessary to confirm its healing potential at long-term follow-up.",0

Currently, microfracture (MFx) represents the most utilized first-line surgical treatment for small, focal chondral lesions. Recent investigations have examined methods of overcoming the limitations of MFx utilizing various augmentation techniques.To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients undergoing isolated MFx versus MFx augmented with orthobiologics or scaffolds for focal chondral defects of the knee.Systematic review and meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 4.A systematic review was performed to identify studies evaluating outcomes and adverse events in patients undergoing isolated MFx versus augmented MFx for focal chondral defects in the knee from 1945 to June 1, 2021. Data were extracted from each article that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were performed for all outcomes reported in a minimum of 3 studies.A total of 14 studies were identified, utilizing 7 different types of injectable augmentation regimens and 5 different scaffolding regimens. Across the 14 studies, a total of 744 patients were included. The mean patient age was 46.8 years (range, 34-58 years), and 58.3% (n = 434/744) of patients were women. The mean final follow-up time was 26.7 months (range, 12-60 months). The mean chondral defect size ranged from 1.3 to 4.8 cm2. A post hoc analysis comparing mean improvement in postoperative outcomes scores compared with preoperative values found no significant differences in the improvement in the visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores between patients undergoing isolated MFx and those undergoing MFx + augmentation. Patients undergoing MFx + augmentation reported significantly greater improvements in the Lysholm score and postoperative MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scores compared with the isolated MFx group.Patients undergoing combined MFx + augmentation reported significant improvements in mean Lysholm and MOCART scores, without significant improvements in VAS, IKDC, or WOMAC scores when compared with patients undergoing isolated MFx.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-011-0853-8,The restoration of full-thickness cartilage defects with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) loaded and cross-linked bilayer collagen scaffolds on rabbit model,"Cartilage has a limited self-repair capability and the repair of large cartilage defects remains a challenge in clinic. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) loaded three-dimensional bilayer collagen scaffold for cartilage repair. Cross-linked three-dimensional bilayer collagen scaffolds seeded with or without MSCs were implanted into large cartilage defects (4 mm in diameter; 3 mm in depth) in rabbit knees. The untreated cartilage defects served as control. The tissue response was evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks after implantation by general histology and semi-quantitative histological grading systems. In addition, the repaired tissues were evaluated by mechanical test at 12 weeks after implantation. The MSCs-loaded collagen scaffold group showed the most hyaline cartilage, highest histological scores and compressive modulus. Moreover, it showed a good integration with the subchondral bone and adjacent cartilage. The structure of the novel bilayer collagen scaffolds provided architectural support for the differentiation of MSCs and demonstrated successful induction of in vivo chondrogenesis. These findings suggested that MSCs-loaded bilayer collagen scaffold could be an appealing candidate to be used for cartilage regeneration.",0
,One-step strategy for cartilage repair using acellular bone matrix scaffold based in situ tissue engineering technique in a preclinical minipig model.,"Cartilage defects are most commonly seen in the knee joint. However, due to the limited self-recovery ability of cartilage, the repair of articular cartilage defects is still a great challenge despite that various approaches have been proposed. We designed a strategy to induce cartilage repair using acellular bone matrix (ABM), thereby creating an appropriate microenvironment for the in-situ cells with an easy surgical application. An in vitro system demonstrated that the ABM scaffold could promote cell adhesion, growth, proliferation, and chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells. This experiment was performed in a minipig cartilage repair model. The repaired tissue was hyaline-like cartilage according to the morphological and histological results. The mechanical properties of the repaired tissue were similar to those of normal cartilage. The integration of repaired tissue and normal tissue in the ABM+M group was better than those of other two groups. The ABM-based, one-stage, minimally invasive, in situ procedure for cartilage regeneration can potentially improve the treatment of articular cartilage defects.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/0963689719861922,Survival Rates of Various Autologous Chondrocyte Grafts and Concomitant Procedures. A Prospective Single-Center Study over 18 Years,"Seven different autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) grafts were used consecutively over a period of 18 years for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knees. The aim was to evaluate this entire ACI patient series for graft-related or unrelated serious adverse events (SAE), graft failures, and to reveal potential risk factors for these incidents. The study group comprised 151 operated patients: classical periosteum-ACI ( n = 45); ACI-seeded fibrin-collagen patch, fixed by either periosteum ( n = 59), collagen membrane ( n = 15), or fibrin glue ( n = 6); ACI seeded alginate-agarose hydrogel ( n = 14); and biomimetic collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold injected with the ACI suspension ( n = 12). The covariates analyzed as possible predicting factors were: age, gender, BMI, lesion depth, lesion size, lesion location, previous surgeries, and concomitant procedures. The Kaplan–Meier method for estimating survival curves, and Cox’s proportional hazards model to test for covariates, were used in the statistical analysis. The patients in this series, follow-up 10.1 (2.1–18.3) years, encountered 11% of graft-related SAE (risk factors: previous cartilage surgery, age over 40 years, BMI over 25 kg/m 2 , and meniscus surgery) and 10% of graft unrelated SAE (risk factors: meniscus surgery and osteotomy). None of these factors was a risk for definitive graft failure. The 10-year graft survival rate was 86%. Females had 2.8 times higher incidence of graft failures than males. There was a tendency toward higher graft failures after a previous cartilage surgery. Different ACI graft types offered safe and durable cartilage repair. Female gender, age over 40 years, increased weight, previous cartilage surgery, and meniscus loss showed increased risk for revision surgery or graft failures.",0

Hypothesis Hyaluronan-based scaffolds seeded with autologous chondrocytes are a viable treatment for damaged articular surface of the patellofemoral joint. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Thirty-two chondral lesions with a mean size of 4.7 cm2 were treated with Hyalograft-C. Twenty-two lesions were located in the patella and 10 in the trochlea. Sixteen patients had previous trauma, 3 had osteochondritis dissecans, and 13 had degenerative changes. Transplantations were carried out arthroscopically or through a miniarthrotomy incision. Eight patients had concomitant procedures, including patellar realignment (2), lateral release (3), and meniscectomy (3). Results were evaluated using the International Cartilage Repair Society–International Knee Documentation Committee scale, EuroQol EQ-5D form, and magnetic resonance imaging scans at 12 and 24 months. Six patients had second-look arthroscopy and biopsies. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired ttest and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results The International Cartilage Repair Society–International Knee Documentation Committee and EuroQol EQ-5D scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (P &lt;. 0001). Objective preoperative data improved from 6/32 (18.8%) with International Knee Documentation Committee A or B to 29/32 (90.7%) at 24 months after transplantation. Mean subjective scores improved from 43.2 points preoperatively to 73.6 points 24 months after implantation. Magnetic resonance imaging studies at 24 months revealed 71% to have an almost normal cartilage with positive correlation to clinical outcomes. Second-look arthroscopies in 6 cases revealed the repaired surface to be nearly normal with biopsy samples characterized as hyaline-like in appearance. Conclusion Biodegradable scaffolds seeded with autologous chondrocytes can be a viable treatment for chondral lesions. The type of tissue repair achieved demonstrated histologic characteristics similar to normal articular cartilage. Long-term investigations are needed to determine the durability of the repair produced with this technique.",0

This study evaluated the results of an in vivo animal study and provides short-term clinical results on a mixture of atelocollagen and fibrin glue-enhanced microfracture techniques in patients with osteochondral lesions (OCL) of the talus.This paper contains animal in vivo data and clinical outcomes on the effectiveness of atelocollagen. An in vivo animal study was conducted with full-thickness cartilage defects created in the femoral condyle of 12 rabbits equally divided into 4 groups evaluated at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Four chondral lesions were created according to one procedure on each rabbit with each lesion treated as follows: (1) microfracture, (2) microfracture and the lesion covered with atelocollagen, (3) microfracture and the lesion covered with mixture of atelocollagen and fibrin glue, and (4) microfracture and the lesion covered with fibrin glue. In the clinical evaluation, 17 patients were treated with a combination of microfracture and atelocollagen injection for symptomatic full-thickness OCL of the talus. They were evaluated by the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Score (AOFAS), Hannover Ankle Score System (HSS), visual analog scale (VAS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and at 12-months follow-up. Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score of the post-op status was compared with the MOCART score and a modified Anderson's score of the pre-op status.In the animal study, subchondral bone and cartilage were generated completely in groups 2 and 3 microscopically. Hyaline-like cartilage was found in the repair tissue. In the clinical evaluation, mean AOFAS improved from 62 to 88, mean HSS improved from 62 to 87, and mean VAS score improved from 64 to 18, respectively (p <0.001). Fifteen patients (89%) reported good or excellent satisfaction. We defined the improvement of most of the subchondral bone edema and bone cyst as well as a chondral lesion by radiologic evaluation.Rapid regeneration of cartilage was demonstrated in the in vivo animal study, and patients showed significant clinical improvement. Atelocollagen-enhanced microfracture enabled a reasonable treatment of cartilage defects.",0

Methods From January 2005 to December 2010, 37 patients with patellofemoral chondral lesions were prospectively followed up, for a minimum of 3 years; 19 of these patients were treated with MACI and 18 with BMAC. Radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical scores (International Knee Documentation Committee, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, visual analog scale, and Tegner) were collected preoperatively, at 2-year and final follow-up. Five patients of MACI and 6 of the BMAC group underwent second-look arthroscopy; 4 patients of each group consented to a concomitant biopsy. Results No adverse reactions or postoperative infections were noted. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups ( P &gt; 0.05). Both groups showed significant improvement in all scores, from preoperative to final follow-up ( P = 0.001), but there was no significant difference in improvement between the 2 groups, except for the IKDC subjective score ( P = 0.015), which favored the BMAC group. Deterioration in MACI and improvement in BMAC group scores were noticed, from 2-year to final follow-up, but was nonsignificant. MACI patients with trochlear lesions showed better results than patellar lesions, while location was not a prognostic factor in the BMAC group. MRI showed complete filling of the defects in 76% of patients in MACI and 81% of patients in BMAC, and histological analysis revealed hyaline-like features. Conclusion Both techniques are viable and effective for large patellofemoral chondral lesions at minimum 3-year follow-up.",1

In the drilling group patients, lesions were penetrated with multiple 1.2-mm Kirschner wires, and in the AOG group patients, grafts were made to cartilage defects from one to three osteochondral pegs harvested from the less-weight-bearing periphery of the articular surface of the femoral condyle. The patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee examination score. Second-look arthroscopy was performed to evaluate the repaired cartilage macroscopically. <h3>Results</h3> The median follow-up duration was 25 (range, 12–42) months. The IKDC scores were significantly improved from 64.4 to 95.4 points in the drilling group and from 52.3 to 94.3 points in the AOG group, with no difference between the two groups, although there was a difference in the repaired cartilage findings of arthroscopy. <h3>Conclusion</h3> In this study, no differences in IKDC scores were found in patients with a concomitant ACL rupture and an osteochondral lesion treated by drilling or AOG at a minimum follow-up of 1year, regardless of the differences at arthroscopic grading of the ICRS classification. <h3>Level of evidence</h3> Case–control study (LEVEL III).",1

The aim of the study was to assess and compare clinical outcomes following the reconstruction of osteochondral lesions in two groups of patients treated with stem cells obtained from blood and with bone marrow concentrate.The study group comprised 46 patients with MRI-confirmed osteochondral lesions of various aetiology. A group of 21 patients was treated with bone marrow concentrate and 25 patients were treated with mesenchymal cells obtained from peripheral blood. Patients were assessed with the use of KOOS, Lysholm and VAS scales at 6 months, and at 1 and 5 years following the reconstruction.We noted a significant improvement across all scales in 40 patients (86%). A poor outcome was noted in 6 patients. There was a statistically significant superiority of the group treated with stem cells obtained from blood. The analysis of MRI evidence in patients with good and excellent results showed satisfactory reconstruction of the cartilaginous surface and good regenerate integration. At 5 years, a slight decrease in mean clinical assessment scores was seen in both groups of patients.1. The modified sandwich reconstruction is an effective modality in the treatment of severe osteochondral lesions of the knee. 2. Slightly poorer outcomes in the group treated with bone marrow concentrate may have resulted from the number of injected stem cells.",0

Synovium was harvested from the knee joints of three strains of rats. The anterior half of the medial meniscus in both knees of F344 rats was removed and 5 million synovial MSCs derived from F344 (syngeneic transplantation), Lewis (minor mismatched transplantation), and ACI (major mismatched transplantation) were injected into the knee of the F344 rats. At 4 weeks, the area of the regenerated meniscus in the F344 group was significantly larger than that in the ACI group. Histological score was significantly better in the F344 and Lewis groups than in the ACI group at 8 weeks. DiI labeled cells could be observed in the knee joint in the F344 group, but were hardly detected in the ACI group at 1 week. The number of macrophages and CD8 T cells at synovium around the meniscus defect was significantly lower in the F344 group than in the ACI group at 1 week. Syngeneic and minor mismatched transplantation of synovial MSCs promoted meniscus regeneration better than major mismatched transplantation in a rat meniscectmized model.",0

Seven patients allowed a third-look biopsy, three of which were performed 18 months post implant. Characteristics of tissues were histologically and histochemically evaluated. The remaining bone stubs were evaluated for cartilage/bone integration. For data analysis, biopsies were further divided into those obtained from postoperative symptomatic patients (n = 41) or from asymptomatic patients (n = 22).The percentage of hyaline regenerated tissues was significantly greater in biopsies obtained after, versus within, 18 months of implantation. Differences were also observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients: reparative tissues taken from symptomatic patients 18 months after grafting were mainly fibrocartilage or mixed (hyaline-fibrocartilage) tissue, while tissues taken from asymptomatic patients were hyaline cartilage in 83% of biopsies. In a small group of asymptomatic patients (n = 3), second-look and third-look biopsies taken 18 months after surgery confirmed maturation of the newly formed tissue over time. Cartilage maturation occurred from the inner regions of the graft, in contact with subchondral bone, towards the periphery of the implant.The study indicates that, in asymptomatic patients after chondrocyte implantation, regenerated tissue undergoes a process of maturation that in the majority of cases takes longer than 18 months for completion and leads to hyaline tissue and not fibrous cartilage. Persistence of symptoms might reflect the presence of a nonhyaline cartilage repair tissue.",0

A randomized study,"Purpose There is an increasing number of reports on the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it is not known what would better drive osteoarthritis stabilization to postpone total knee arthroplasty (TKA): targeting the synovial fluid by injection or targeting on the subchondral bone with MSCs implantation. Methods A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out between 2000 and 2005 in 120 knees of 60 patients with painful bilateral knee osteoarthritis with a similar osteoarthritis grade. During the same anaesthesia, a bone marrow concentrate of 40 mL containing an average 5727 MSCs/mL (range 2740 to 7540) was divided in two equal parts: after randomization, one part (20 mL) was delivered to the subchondral bone of femur and tibia of one knee (subchondral group) and the other part was injected in the joint for the contralateral knee (intra-articular group). MSCs were counted as CFU-F (colony fibroblastic unit forming). Clinical outcomes of the patient (Knee Society score) were obtained along with radiological imaging outcomes (including MRIs) at two year follow-up. Subsequent revision surgeries were identified until the most recent follow-up (average of 15 years, range 13 to 18 years). Results At two year follow-up, clinical and imaging (MRI) improvement was higher on the side that received cells in the subchondral bone. At the most recent follow-up (15 years), among the 60 knees treated with subchondral cell therapy, the yearly arthroplasty incidence was 1.3% per knee-year; for the 60 knees with intra-articular cell therapy, the yearly arthroplasty incidence was higher (p = 0.01) with an incidence of 4.6% per knee-year. For the side with subchondral cell therapy, 12 (20%) of 60 knees underwent TKA, while 42 (70%) of 60 knees underwent TKA on the side with intra-articular cell therapy. Among the 18 patients who had no subsequent surgery on both sides, all preferred the knee with subchondral cell therapy. Conclusions Implantation of MSCs in the subchondral bone of an osteoarthritic knee is more effective to postpone TKA than injection of the same intra-articular dose in the contralateral knee with the same grade of osteoarthritis.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.b.33677,Determination of joint loads using new sensate scaffolds for regenerating large cartilage defects in the knee,"Two complete unicondylar surface replacement scaffold designs to support tissue-engineered cartilage growth that utilized adult endogenous stem cells were 3D printed and tested in a dog stifle model. Integrated rosette strain gauges were calibrated and used to determine shear loading within stifle joints for up to 12 months. An activity index that compared extent of daily activity with tissue formation showed differences in the extent and quality of new tissue with the most active animal having the most new tissue formation. Shear loads were highest early and decreased with time indicating that cartilage tissue formation begins while tissues experience high shear loads and continues as the loads decrease toward normal physiological levels. Scaffolds with biomimetic support pegs facilitated the most rapid bone ingrowth and were noted to have more cartilage formation with better quality cartilage as measured using both indentation testing and histology. Comparison of implant placement depth to previous studies suggested that placement depth affects the amount of tissue formation. This study provides measurements of loading patterns and cartilage regeneration on a complete medial condylar surface replacement that can be used for preclinical testing of a tissue engineering approach for the most common form of early stage osteoarthritis, unicondylar disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effect of adipocyte tissue derived stem cell therapy,"We aimed to investigate the effect of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) on chondral healing using the microfracture (MF) technique.Thirty male rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. Standard cylindrical osteochondral defects (OCDs) were created in the weight-bearing areas of the medial condyles of all the right knees; the defects were four millimeters in diameter and two millimeters in depth. The control group (group A) was restricted to spontaneous healing. For group B, we performed MF with a 1.5-mm drill. For group C, we applied MF using the same method and then applied 3×10(6) ADSCs to the defect area. At eight weeks post-operation, the subjects were sacrificed, and the distal femoral joint surfaces were evaluated histopathologically for chondral healing. The samples were scored according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scale.The results for group C were significantly better than those for group A in terms of the surface properties (p=0.003). The matrix evaluation was better for group A than for group C (p=0.01). The cell distribution, cell viability and subchondral bone parameters were similar between the groups (p=0.198, p=0.387 and p=0.699). The cartilage mineralization parameter was better for group C than for group A (p=0.001). The signs of healing were better for group C than for group B, but the differences were not significant (p=0.185).Improvements with additional ADSC treatments were not statistically significant in cases in which ADSC treatment was compared with isolated MF treatment.Additional ADSCs treatment may have positive effect on chondral healing but it doesn't seem significant.",0

With IACUC approval, purpose-bred research hounds (n = 24) underwent arthroscopic impact injury (40 N) to both medial femoral condyles. At 3 months, functional assessments, arthroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. One knee in each dog (n = 24; n = 12 per endpoint) was randomly assigned to SCP with the other knee randomly assigned to SCP + PRP, SCP + BMC or sham injection (control) (n = 8 per group; n = 4 per endpoint). Dogs were evaluated at 6 and 12 months after treatment using functional assessments, radiography, arthroscopy, and MRI and humanely euthanatized at 6 or 12 months after treatment for histologic assessments. At 6 months post-treatment, comfortable range-of-motion (CROM) was higher (p < 0.04) in SCP + PRP and SCP + BMC knees compared with controls. At 1 year post-treatment, %Total Pressure Index was higher (p = 0.036) in SCP + BMC compared with controls, pain was lower (p < 0.05) in SCP + BMC and SCP + PRP compared with SCP and controls, and CROM was higher (p < 0.05) in SCP + BMC and SCP + PRP compared with SCP and controls. Knees treated with SCP + PRP and SCP + BMC had better (p < 0.05) MRI grades than SCP and controls. No statistically significant differences in arthroscopic or histologic pathology were noted. Clinical significance: Biologics added to SCP treatment may further enhance its beneficial effects by improving range-of-motion, pain severity, and limb loading through 1 year after treatment.

The characteristics of cell-seed scaffolds, behavior of cells seeded into scaffolds, and surgical techniques were also discussed. Clinical outcomes and quality of repaired tissue were assessed using several standardized outcome assessment tools, magnetic resonance imaging scans, and biopsy histology.One-step cartilage repair could be divided into 2 types: chondrocyte-matrix complex (CMC) and autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC), both of which allow a simplified surgical approach. Studies with Level IV evidence have shown that 1-step cartilage repair techniques could significantly relieve symptoms and improve functional assessment (P < .05, compared with preoperative evaluation) at short-term follow-up. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging showed that 76% cases in all included case series showed at least 75% defect coverage in each lesion, and 3 studies clearly showed hyaline-like cartilage tissue in biopsy tissues by second-look arthroscopy.The 1-step cartilage repair technique, with its potential for effective, homogeneous distribution of chondrocytes and multipotent stem cells on the surface of the cartilage defect, is able to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage tissue, and it could be applied to cartilage repair by arthroscopy.Level IV, systematic review of Level II and IV studies.",0

Inclusion criteria limited to English language studies International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading criteria for cartilage analysis after ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation), MF (microfracture), or OATS (osteochondral autografting) repair techniques.Thirty-three studies investigating 1511 patients were identified. Thirty evaluated ACI or one of its subtypes, six evaluated MF, and seven evaluated OATS. There was no evidence of publication bias (Begg's p=0.48). No statistically significant correlation was found between percent change in clinical outcome and percent biopsies showing ICRS Excellent scores (R(2)=0.05, p=0.38). Percent change in clinical outcome and percent of biopsies showing only hyaline cartilage were significantly associated (R(2)=0.24, p=0.024).

Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were collegiate or professional basketball players at the time of surgery. Patient demographics, lesion size and location, and surgical details were collected. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans were scored with the OCAMRISS system. Time to return to play and pre- versus postoperative player performance were determined with publicly available internet resources.Eleven athletes (4 professional, 7 collegiate) with a total of 14 treated lesions (1 to the medial femoral condyle, 6 to the lateral femoral condyle, 5 to the trochlea, and 2 to the patella) were eligible for study inclusion. Mean lesion size was 509 mm2. All patients underwent OCA through an arthrotomy, with fresh grafts. The overall rate of return to play at the same level of competition was 80%. Median time to return to play was 14 months (range, 6-26 months). Among players with available statistics, there was no significant reduction in any performance category.OCA in elite basketball players results in an 80% return to previous level of competition, which is consistent with previous reports of athletes playing other sports.

https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0272,Fibrin-Based Model for Cartilage Regeneration: Tissue Maturation from<i>In Vitro</i>to<i>In Vivo</i>,"One of the crucial points for a successful tissue-engineering approach for cartilage repair is represented by the level of in vitro maturation of the engineered tissue before implantation. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the level of in vitro maturation of engineered cartilaginous samples on the tissue quality after in vivo implantation. Samples were obtained from isolated swine articular chondrocytes embedded in fibrin glue. The cell-fibrin composites were either cultured in vitro or directly implanted in vivo for 1, 5, and 9 weeks. Other experimental samples were precultured for either 1 or 5 weeks in vitro and then implanted in vivo for 4 additional weeks. All the samples were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, and gene expression. The results strongly suggest that the in vivo culture in this model promoted a better tissue maturation than that obtained in the in vitro condition, and that 1 week in vitro preculture resulted in the primary structuring of the engineered composites and their subsequent maturation in vivo, without affecting the cell viability and activity, while a prolonged in vitro preculture caused a cell and matrix degeneration that could not be rescued in vivo.",0

Various techniques, both palliative and reparative, have been used to treat this pathology with variable success rates. In recent years, however, regenerative techniques, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, have emerged as possible solutions for the treatment of chondral knee lesions. The use of classic autologous chondrocyte implantation (first generation) has been associated with several limitations. To address these problems, tissue-engineering techniques have been developed. We selected a biodegradable, biocompatible, hyaluronian-based scaffold for cell proliferation. This matrix autologous chondrocyte transplantation procedure avoids the use of periosteal flap, simplifies the surgical procedure, and can be performed using an arthroscopic procedure. Thus, the surgical morbidity and the recovery time for the patient are extremely reduced with no complications related to the periosteal flap. The short- to medium-term follow-up clinical and histological results are encouraging.",0

As bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) have the capacity to make both bone-like and cartilage-like tissues, they are an ideal cell population for use in the manufacture of osteochondral tissues. Effective differentiation of MSC to bone-like and cartilage-like tissues requires two unique medium formulations and this presents a challenge both in achieving initial MSC differentiation and in maintaining tissue stability when the unified osteochondral tissue is subsequently cultured in a single medium formulation. In this proof-of-principle study, we used an in-house fabricated microwell platform to manufacture thousands of micropellets formed from 166 MSC each. We then characterized the development of bone-like and cartilage-like tissue formation in the micropellets maintained for 8-14 days in sequential combinations of osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium. When bone-like or cartilage-like micropellets were induced for only 8 days, they displayed significant phenotypic changes when the osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium, respectively, was swapped. Based on these data, we developed an extended 14-day protocol for the pre-culture of bone-like and cartilage-like micropellets in their respective induction medium. Unified osteochondral tissues were formed by layering 12,000 osteogenic micropellets and 12,000 chondrogenic micropellets into a biphasic structure and then further culture in chondrogenic induction medium. The assembled tissue was cultured for a further 8 days and characterized via histology. The micropellets had amalgamated into a continuous structure with distinctive bone-like and cartilage-like regions. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of micropellet assembly for the formation of osteochondral-like tissues for possible use in osteochondral defect repair.",0

An indirect co-culture model was developed, representing a chondrocyte/scaffold-construct repair of a cartilage defect adjoining bone, where the bone could have varying degrees of degeneration. Human BM-MSCs were isolated from two areas of subchondral bone in each of five osteochondral tissue specimens from five patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. These two areas underlaid the macroscopically and histologically best and worst cartilage, representing early and late-stage OA, respectively. BM-MSCs were co-cultured with normal chondrocytes suspended in agarose, with the two cell types separated by a porous membrane. After 0, 7, 14 and 21 days, chondrocyte-agarose scaffolds were assessed by gene expression and biochemical analyses, and the abundance of selected proteins in conditioned media was assessed by ELISA. Co-culture with late-OA BM-MSCs resulted in a reduction in GAG deposition and a decreased expression of genes encoding matrix-specific proteins (COL2A1 and ACAN), compared to culturing with early OA BM-MSCs. The concentration of TGF-β1 was significantly higher in the early OA conditioned media. The results of this study have clinical implications for cartilage repair, suggesting that the health of the subchondral bone may influence the outcomes of chondrocyte-based repair strategies.",0

Our study investigates the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) graft at 5-year follow-up to determine if it provides a durable treatment option in patients with an average age of 42 (standard deviation 11.6). Twenty-three patients were available for follow-up. Nine patients required realignment of the extensor mechanism with lateral release and TTT. The MRI magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring system was used to assess the graft status. Clinical outcomes were assessed at these time periods. The mean weighted MOCART composite score improved from 2.87 at 3 months to 3.39 at 5 years, indicating an intact appearance in most grafts. Graft height measured \textbackslashtextgreater 50 % of the adjacent native cartilage in 82 % of patients. Clinical improvement assessed by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, SF-36 (PCS) and the 6-minute walk test was demonstrated between pre-operative scores and final 5-year follow-up. 91 % of patients would undergo MACI again. Correlation between MOCART and clinical scores were low in MACI to the patellofemoral joint. No significant difference was found in outcome between those that required realignment surgery compared with those that did not. Patellofemoral MACI provides a durable graft on MRI assessment at 5 years with resultant clinical improvement.

In this experimental study, we used the sheep animal model for the creation of knee cartilage defects. In the medial part of the trochlea and on the medial condyle of the femur, we created artificial defects (6 × 3 mm2) with microfractures. In four experimental sheep, both defects were subsequently filled with the porous acellular polyhydroxybutyrate/chitosan (PHB/CHIT)-based implant. Two sheep had untreated defects. We evaluated the quality of the newly formed tissue in the femoral trochlea defect site using imaging (X-ray, Computer Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)), macroscopic, and histological methods. Macroscopically, the surface of the treated regenerate corresponded to the niveau of the surrounding cartilage. X-ray examination 6 months after the implantation confirmed the restoration of the contour in the subchondral calcified layer and the advanced rate of bone tissue integration. The CT scan revealed a low regenerative potential in the bone zone of the defect compared to the cartilage zone. The percentage change in cartilage density at the defect site was not significantly different to the reference area (0.06–6.4%). MRI examination revealed that the healing osteochondral defect was comparable to the intact cartilage signal on the surface of the defect. Hyaline-like cartilage was observed in most of the treated animals, except for one, where the defect was repaired with fibrocartilage. Thus, the acellular, chitosan-based biomaterial is a promising biopolymer composite for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects of traumatic character. It has potential for further clinical testing in the orthopedic field, primarily with the combination of supporting factors.",0

Current treatment methods fall short with respect to their ability to improve the intra-articular environment and restore normal joint homeostasis. With increasing basic science and clinical evidence showing efficacy, cell-based therapies such as bone marrow concentrate (BMC) hold promise as a nonsurgical joint preserving treatment approach. BMC has inherent advantages over other treatments commonly used for various knee pathologies because it is a point-of-care orthobiologic product that uniquely and simultaneously delivers growth factors, anti-inflammatory proteins, and mesenchymal stem cells. There is increasing evidence for the use of BMC for repair of focal cartilage defects and for the treatment of generalized knee pain. However, continued high-quality studies are necessary for the clinical utility of BMC to be critically assessed with particular attention paid to appropriate patient selection, standardized aspiration, and processing and reporting of both functional and imaging-based outcomes.",0

Many new surgical strategies have been developed to treat these lesions. It is important for the radiologist to have an understanding of these procedures and their appearance on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

Cartilage repair surgery, no matter the technique, requires a noninvasive, standardized, and high-quality longitudinal method to assess the structure of the repair tissue. This goal is best fulfilled by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The present article provides an overview of the current state of the art of MRI of cartilage repair. In the first 2 sections, preclinical and clinical MRI of cartilage repair tissue are described with a focus on morphological depiction of cartilage and the use of functional (biochemical) MR methodologies for the visualization of the ultrastructure of cartilage repair. In the third section, a short overview is provided on the regulatory issues of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) regarding MR follow-up studies of patients after cartilage repair surgeries.",0

To meet these demands, a biphasic scaffold of allogenous sterilized bone with a collagen surface was developed. Integration was tested in the sheep model.Cartilage chips were taken from the nonweight-bearing area of the left knee of 12 sheep and cultured. After 4 wk a second procedure followed and defects of 9.4-mm diameter at the weight-bearing area of the medial femoral condyle of the right knee were created. The sterilized scaffold was inserted and the cultured autologous chondrocytes were dripped onto the surface. After 6 wk, 3 mo, and 6 mo the animals were sacrificed; the explanted femoral condyles were evaluated macroscopically and using histologic, immunohistochemical, and electronmicroscopic methods.After 6 wk the level of the surface was well preserved, after 3 mo parts of the scaffold were sintered but after 6 mo the surface was continuous. Full integration of the allogenous bone could be observed after 6 mo. The surface of the scaffold after 6 wk consisted of bone, but after 3 mo some chondrocytes and after 6 mo a continuous chondral layer could be detected.The biphasic scaffold of allogenous bone and collagen proved to be stable and sufficiently integrated in the short- and midterm interval. Whether the chondrocytes on the surface had been derived from implanted chondrocytes or the scaffold with its surface was sufficiently chondroconductive must be answered in further investigations.",0
https://doi.org/10.4103/ortho.ijortho_260_17,Role of High Tibial Osteotomy in Cartilage Regeneration – Is Correction of Malalignment Mandatory for Success?,"Malalignment of the knee can cause debilitating symptoms such as pain, resulting in a decline in function and mobility. Surgical options that exist to address this problem include realignment osteotomies and joint replacements. Realignment osteotomies are the more appropriate options in certain patient populations, especially with regard to age and level of activity. Since a high tibial osteotomy (HTO) was first used to manage malalignment of the knee and osteoarthritis, different techniques involving the use of specialized implants have been developed and further refined to good effect. There has also since been much research into the field of cartilage restoration techniques, both as a standalone treatment option and as an adjunct to a realignment osteotomy. This review attempts to detail the origin and the evolution of HTO, particularly in regard to combining this tried and tested procedure with adjunct cartilage restoration techniques, and the overall patient outcomes. A literature search on PubMed was performed, and articles pertaining to the outcomes of the use of an HTO and cartilage restoration techniques were reviewed. The literature in this field indicates good outcomes in terms of objective measurements of cartilage regeneration (such as arthroscopic visualization and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation) and subjective patient outcome scoring systems (such as the International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores) with a realignment osteotomy alone, and studies have shown that patient outcomes can be further improved with the use of a cartilage restoration procedure as an adjunct.",0

However, the effectiveness was limited by the number of cells obtained, so large-sized defects (&gt;500 mm 2 ) were not investigated. The use of MSC aggregates may enable treatment of larger defects by increasing the number of MSCs adhering to the cartilage defect. Purpose: To investigate whether transplantation of aggregates of autologous synovial MSCs with 2-step surgery could promote articular cartilage regeneration in microminipig osteochondral defects. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Synovial MSCs derived from a microminipig were examined for in vitro colony-forming and multidifferentiation abilities. An aggregate of 250,000 synovial MSCs was formed with hanging drop culture, and 16 aggregates (for each defect) were implanted on both osteochondral defects (6 × 6 × 1.5 mm) created in the medial femoral condyle and femoral groove (MSC group). The defects in the contralateral knee were left empty (control group). The knee joints were evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks by macroscopic findings and histology. MRI T1rho mapping images were acquired at 12 weeks. For cell tracking, synovial MSCs were labeled with ferucarbotran before aggregate formation and were observed with MRI at 1 week. Results: Synovial MSCs showed in vitro colony-forming and multidifferentiation abilities. Regenerative cartilage formation was significantly better in the MSC group than in the control group, as indicated by International Cartilage Repair Society score (macro), modified Wakitani score (histology), and T1rho mapping (biochemical MRI) in the medial condyle at 12 weeks. Implanted cells, labeled with ferucarbotran, were observed in the osteochondral defects at 1 week with MRI. No significant difference was noted in the modified Wakitani score at 4 weeks in the medial condyle and at 4 and 12 weeks in the femoral groove. Conclusion: Transplantation of autologous synovial MSC aggregates promoted articular cartilage regeneration at the medial femoral condyle at 12 weeks in microminipigs. Clinical Relevance: Aggregates of autologous synovial MSCs could expand the indications for cartilage repair with synovial MSCs.",0
https://doi.org/10.3791/4423,Treatment of Osteochondral Defects in the Rabbit's Knee Joint by Implantation of Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Fibrin Clots,"The treatment of osteochondral articular defects has been challenging physicians for many years. The better understanding of interactions of articular cartilage and subchondral bone in recent years led to increased attention to restoration of the entire osteochondral unit. In comparison to chondral lesions the regeneration of osteochondral defects is much more complex and a far greater surgical and therapeutic challenge. The damaged tissue does not only include the superficial cartilage layer but also the subchondral bone. For deep, osteochondral damage, as it occurs for example with osteochondrosis dissecans, the full thickness of the defect needs to be replaced to restore the joint surface (1). Eligible therapeutic procedures have to consider these two different tissues with their different intrinsic healing potential (2). In the last decades, several surgical treatment options have emerged and have already been clinically established (3-6). Autologous or allogeneic osteochondral transplants consist of articular cartilage and subchondral bone and allow the replacement of the entire osteochondral unit. The defects are filled with cylindrical osteochondral grafts that aim to provide a congruent hyaline cartilage covered surface (3,7,8). Disadvantages are the limited amount of available grafts, donor site morbidity (for autologous transplants) and the incongruence of the surface; thereby the application of this method is especially limited for large defects. New approaches in the field of tissue engineering opened up promising possibilities for regenerative osteochondral therapy. The implantation of autologous chondrocytes marked the first cell based biological approach for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage lesions and is now worldwide established with good clinical results even 10 to 20 years after implantation (9,10). However, to date, this technique is not suitable for the treatment of all types of lesions such as deep defects involving the subchondral bone (11). The sandwich-technique combines bone grafting with current approaches in Tissue Engineering (5,6). This combination seems to be able to overcome the limitations seen in osteochondral grafts alone. After autologous bone grafting to the subchondral defect area, a membrane seeded with autologous chondrocytes is sutured above and facilitates to match the topology of the graft with the injured site. Of course, the previous bone reconstruction needs additional surgical time and often even an additional surgery. Moreover, to date, long-term data is missing (12). Tissue Engineering without additional bone grafting aims to restore the complex structure and properties of native articular cartilage by chondrogenic and osteogenic potential of the transplanted cells. However, again, it is usually only the cartilage tissue that is more or less regenerated. Additional osteochondral damage needs a specific further treatment. In order to achieve a regeneration of the multilayered structure of osteochondral defects, three-dimensional tissue engineered products seeded with autologous/allogeneic cells might provide a good regeneration capacity (11). Beside autologous chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seem to be an attractive alternative for the development of a full-thickness cartilage tissue. In numerous preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, mesenchymal stem cells have displayed excellent tissue regeneration potential (13,14). The important advantage of mesenchymal stem cells especially for the treatment of osteochondral defects is that they have the capacity to differentiate in osteocytes as well as chondrocytes. Therefore, they potentially allow a multilayered regeneration of the defect. In recent years, several scaffolds with osteochondral regenerative potential have therefore been developed and evaluated with promising preliminary results (1,15-18). Furthermore, fibrin glue as a cell carrier became one of the preferred techniques in experimental cartilage repair and has already successfully been used in several animal studies (19-21) and even first human trials (22). The following protocol will demonstrate an experimental technique for isolating mesenchymal stem cells from a rabbit's bone marrow, for subsequent proliferation in cell culture and for preparing a standardized in vitro-model for fibrin-cell-clots. Finally, a technique for the implantation of pre-established fibrin-cell-clots into artificial osteochondral defects of the rabbit's knee joint will be described.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2521-0,Implantation of tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue for the treatment for full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee,"The purposes of this study were to evaluate early- to midterm clinical results after implantation of tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue for the treatment for full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee and to identify the factors affecting the final clinical results. Tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue was prepared by culturing autologous chondrocytes in atelocollagen gel for 3-4 weeks. A total of 73 knees of 72 patients with full-thickness cartilage defects were implanted with this tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue. The follow-up of these patients for \textbackslashtextgreater 5 years (range 5-11 years, median 8.0 years) is reported. The patients were evaluated clinically using a rating scale, as well as arthroscopically, biomechanically, and histologically. A modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system was used to quantify the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the lesions. The patient or defect factors influencing the final clinical outcomes were also investigated. Clinical rating improved significantly after implantation of tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue. Arthroscopic findings at 2 years after implantation were graded as normal or nearly normal according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scale in 64 of 73 knees (87.7 %). Biomechanically, stiffness of the graft almost equalled the surrounding normal cartilage (87.9-102.5 %) at 2 years after implantation. Histologically, overall assessment of the repaired tissue by ICRS Visual Assessment Scale II was 70.4 +/- A 20.8. The average MOCART score was 13.5 +/- A 11.3 (0-45) preoperatively, 66.6 +/- A 16.8 (10-90) at 1 year after implantation, 70.4 +/- A 16.1 (15-90) at 2 years after implantation, and 72.5 +/- A 17.4 (15-95) at the final follow-up, indicating that MRI results were maintained. Among the factors investigated, only arthroscopic grade of the repaired lesion at 2 years after implantation was significantly correlated with the final clinical scores. Implantation of tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue for the cartilage defects of the knee was effective in short- to midterm post-operatively. This procedure can be proposed as one option for repairing full-thickness cartilage defect of the knee. IV.",0

Patients and Methods: Autologous BM-MSCs were culture expanded, placed on PR-FG intraoperatively, and then transplanted into 5 full-thickness cartilage defects of femoral condyles of 5 patients and covered with an autologous periosteal flap. Patients were evaluated clinically at 6 and 12 mo by the Lysholm and Revised Hospital for Special Surgery Knee (RHSSK) scores and radiographically by x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the same time points. Repair tissue in 2 patients was rated arthroscopically after 12 mo using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Arthroscopic Score. Study Design: Case series; level of evidence 4. Results: All patients’ symptoms improved over the follow-up period of 12 mo. Average Lysholm and RHSSK scores for all patients showed statistically significant improvement at 6 and 12 mo postoperatively ( P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the 6 and 12 mo postoperative clinical scores ( P = 0.18). ICRS arthroscopic scores were 8/12 and 11/12 (nearly normal) for the 2 patients who consented to arthroscopy. MRI of 3 patients at 12 mo postoperatively revealed complete defect fill and complete surface congruity with native cartilage, whereas that of 2 patients showed incomplete congruity. Conclusion: Autologous BM-MSC transplantation on PR-FG as a cell scaffold may be an effective approach to promote the repair of articular cartilage defects of the knee in human patients.",0

The stability of the membrane was evaluated after implantation in a cartilage defect on both sides of the joint in 12 hips in six cadavers. The hip was manually put through a full range of motion for 50 cycles after each lesion had been created and filled, starting with the acetabulum. The implanted membranes showed stability in 83.3% of the acetabular defects and in 33.3% of the femoral defects after the 50 cycles. After an additional 50 cycles the acetabular membrane showed stability in a total of eight (67%) out of 12 acetabular lesions. The results indicate that this membrane tissue is potentially stable in cartilage defects of the acetabulum, which may have clinical applications in autologous chondrocyte implantation.",0

The aim of the present study was to explore the therapeutic potential of cartilage regeneration using a new biphasic scaffold (type I collagen/hydroxyapatite) previously loaded or not with concentrated bone marrow cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Female rabbits were operated of one knee to create articular lesions of the trochlea (three holes of 4 × 4mm). The holes were left empty in the control group or were filled with the scaffold alone or the scaffold previously loaded with concentrated bone marrow cells. After two months, rabbits were sacrificed and the structure of the newly formed tissues were evaluated by macroscopic, MRI, and immunohistochemistry analyses. RESULTS: Macroscopic and MRI evaluation of the knees did not show differences between the three groups (p \textbackslashtextgreater 0.05). However, histological analysis demonstrated that a higher O'Driscoll score was obtained in the two groups treated with the scaffold, as compared to the control group (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). The number of cells in treated area was higher in scaffold groups compared to the control group (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). There was no difference for intensity of collagen type II between the groups (p \textbackslashtextgreater 0.05) but subchondral bone repair was significantly thicker in scaffold-treated groups than in the control group (1 mm for the control group vs 2.1 and 2.6 mm for scaffold groups). Furthermore, we observed that scaffolds previously loaded with concentrated bone marrow were more reabsorbed (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of a biphasic scaffold previously loaded with concentrated bone marrow significantly improves cartilage lesion healing.",0

Three patients also underwent ACL-reconstruction; one patient a high tibial osteotomy. The underlying indication was osteochondrosis dissecans in four and trauma in five patients. The defect size was 25×25mm in three patients and 30×30 in six patients and the depth ranged from eight to 14mm. All OCD lesions were located on the medial femoral condyle; two of the traumatic lesions were located on the lateral femoral condyle. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Lysholm and IKDC scores. Radiographic incorporation was evaluated using serial radiographs and MR imaging at one year post surgery. All patients were reviewed at three, six, 12, and 24months following surgery.The Lysholm (IKDC) score improved significantly (p=0.02 resp. p=0.007) within and between patients during the follow-up period from 40.9 (37) to 90.9 (87.1) at 2years. Radiographic union was observed in all patients at three months; on MR imaging at one year osseous integration was observed in eight patients. Graft subsidence with loss of the overlying cartilage was observed in one and subchondral cystic changes at the implantation side were seen in another patient.The results of this case series suggest that irradiated osteochondral allograft provides significant medium-term clinical improvement in patients treated for large osteochondral lesions of the femoral condyles.IV, case series.",0

Our primary focus is on the effects of this procedure on children and adolescent patients as there is a lack of knowledge regarding the clinical outcomes in children/adolescents in particular when compared with adults. METHODS: A total of 40 patients (43 defects) \textbackslashtextless20 years with cartilage defects of the knee were treated with third generation ACI (Novocart® 3D). These defects were caused by osteochondritis dissecans (n = 13), acute trauma (\textbackslashtextless12 months) (n = 9), old trauma (\textbackslashtextgreater12 months) (n = 5) or unknown pathology (n = 13). The mean defect size was 5.2 cm(2). IKDC subjective score and VAS (at rest and during activity) were used for clinical evaluation after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-operatively. The results of these patients were compared with 40 matched adult patients. Match paired analysis was performed by numbers of treated defects, defect location and defect size. All cartilage defects were arthroscopically classified with IKDC grade III-IV. All adult patients in the control group were treated with matrix based autologous chondrocyte implantation. RESULTS: All patients showed significantly better clinical results compared with the pre-operative findings in the follow-up over three years. We observed significantly better results in the IKDC score and VAS during the whole postoperative follow-up in children and adolescents after six, 12, 24 and 36 months compared with the adult control group. The IKDC score improved from 46.5 preoperative to 77.5 (+31) after three years in children and adolescents. Similarly, significantly lower stress pain after six months and one, two and three years was found in this group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that third generation autologous chondrocyte implantation is a suitable method for the treatment of full cartilage defects in children and adolescents.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-005-0051-y,MR imaging of autologous chondrocyte implantation of the knee,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a surgical technique that is increasingly being used in the treatment of full-thickness defects of articular cartilage in the knee. It involves the arthroscopic harvesting and in vitro culture of chondrocytes that are subsequently implanted into a previously identified chondral defect. The aim is to produce a repair tissue that closely resembles hyaline articular cartilage that gradually becomes incorporated, restoring joint congruity. Over the long term, it is hoped that this will prevent the progression of full-thickness articular cartilage defects to osteoarthritis. This article reviews the indications and operative procedure performed in ACI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences that provide optimal visualization of articular cartilage in the post-operative period are discussed. Normal appearances of ACI on MRI are presented along with common complications that are encountered with this technique.",0

The NeoCart is a tissue-engineered collagen matrix seeded with autogenous chondrocytes designed for the repair of hyaline articular cartilage. Hypothesis The NeoCart implant is well tolerated in the human knee. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Eight patients (treatment group) with full-thickness cartilage injury were treated with the NeoCart and evaluated prospectively. Autogenous chondrocytes provided by arthroscopic biopsy were seeded into a 3-dimensional type I collagen scaffold. The seeded scaffold was subjected to a tissue-engineering protocol including treatment with a bioreactor. Implantation of the prepared cartilage tissue patch was performed via miniarthrotomy and secured with a collagen bioadhesive. Evaluations through 24 months postoperatively included the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire, visual analog scale, range of motion, and cartilage-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including quantitative T2 mapping. Results Pain scores after NeoCart implantation were significantly lower than baseline at 12 and 24 months after the procedure (P &lt; .05). Improved function and motion were also noted at 24 months. Six patients had 67% to 100% defect fill at 24 months with MRI evaluation. One patient had moderate (33%-66%) defect fill, and another patient had poor (less than 33%) defect fill. Partial stratification of T2 values was observed for 2 patients at 12 months and 4 patients at 24 months. No patients experienced arthrofibrosis or implant hypertrophy. Conclusion Pain was significantly reduced 12 and 24 months after NeoCart treatment. Trends toward improved function and motion were observed 24 months after implantation. The MRI indicated implant stability and peripheral integration, defect fill without overgrowth, progressive maturation, and more organized cartilage formation.",0

The goal of the present study was to synthesize and characterize a novel biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel comprised of poly(ethylene glycol), gelatin, and genipin, and examine the hydrogel as an injectable biomaterial in combination with a cyanoacrylate-based surgical sealant for cartilage repair. An osteochondral knee defect was generated in 24 rats, then the hydrogel, with or without a surgical sealant, was injected into the defect and followed for 14 days. The results demonstrated that the hydrogel is biocompatible and biodegradable, and that the cyanoacrylate-based surgical sealant is a relatively safe option for maintaining the hydrogel in the defect. This is the first study describing a cyanoacrylate-based surgical sealant in combination with a polymer hydrogel for cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.10.015,Zone-specific integrated cartilage repair using a scaffold-free tissue engineered construct derived from allogenic synovial mesenchymal stem cells: Biomechanical and histological assessments,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the zone-specific integration properties of articular cartilage defects treated in vivo with scaffold-free three-dimensional tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) derived from allogenic synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a porcine model. The TEC derived from the synovial MSCs was implanted into chondral defects in the medial femoral condyle of the knee. The integration boundary of repair tissue with the adjacent host cartilage was morphologically and biomechanically evaluated at 6 months post-implantation. Histological assessments showed that the repair tissue in each zone was well integrated with the adjacent host cartilage, with an apparent secure continuity of the extracellular matrix. There were no significant differences in histological scores between the integration boundary and the center of the repair tissue at every zone. Nonetheless, in all the specimens subjected to mechanical testing, failure occurred at the integration boundary. The average tensile strength of the integration boundary vs normal cartilage was 0.6 vs 4.9, 3.0 vs 12.6, and 5.5 vs 12.8MPa at the superficial, middle, and deep layers, respectively. Thus, these results indicate the most fragile point in the repair tissue remained at the integration boundary in spite of the apparent secure tissue continuity and equivalent histological quality with the center of the repair tissue. Such tissue vulnerability at the surface integration boundary could affect the long-term durability of the tissue repair, and thus, special consideration will be needed in the post-operative rehabilitation programming to enhance the longevity of such repair tissues in response to normal knee loading.",0

Current Procedural Terminology codes for all patients undergoing MFX, ACI, OATS, and OCA were used to search a prospectively collected, commercially available private payer insurance company database from 2007 to 2011. Within 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery, the database was searched for the occurrence of these same patients undergoing knee diagnostic arthroscopy with biopsy, lysis of adhesions, synovectomy, arthroscopy for infection or lavage, arthroscopy for removal of loose bodies, chondroplasty, MFX, ACI, OATS, OCA, and/or knee arthroplasty. Descriptive statistical analysis and contingency table analysis were performed. A total of 47,207 cartilage procedures were performed from 2007 to 2011, including 43,576 MFX, 640 ACI, 386 open OATS, 997 arthroscopic OATS, 714 open OCA, and 894 arthroscopic OCA procedures. The weighted average reoperation rates for all procedures were 5.87% at 90 days, 11.94% at 1 year, and 14.90% at 2 years following the index cartilage surgery. At 2 years, patients who underwent MFX, ACI, OATS, OCA had reoperation rates of 14.65%, 29.69%, 8.82%, and 12.22%, respectively. There was a statistically significantly increased risk for ACI return to OR within all intervals (P < .0001); however, MFX had a greater risk factor (P < .0001) for conversion to arthroplasty. There was no difference in failure/revision rates between the restorative treatment options. With a large US commercial insurance database from 2007 to 2011, reparative procedures were favored for chondral injuries, but yielded an increased risk for conversion to arthroplasty. There was no difference in failure/revision rates between the restorative approaches, yet cell-based approaches yielded a significantly increased risk for a return to the OR.",0

Long-term implant performance was addressed in a standardized in vitro model. PGA implants (+/- bovine chondrocytes) were placed inside cartilage rings punched out of bovine femoral trochleas (outer Ø 6 mm; inner defect Ø 2 mm) and cultured for 84 days (12 weeks). Cartilage/PGA hybrids were subsequently analyzed by histology (hematoxylin/eosin; safranin O), immunohistochemistry (aggrecan, collagens 1 and 2), protein assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, and implant push-out force measurements. Cartilage/PGA hybrids remained vital with intact matrix until 12 weeks, limited loss of proteoglycans from ""host"" cartilage or cartilage-PGA interface, and progressively diminishing release of proteoglycans into the supernatant. By contrast, the collagen 2 content in cartilage and cartilage-PGA interface remained approximately constant during culture (with only little collagen 1). Both implants (+/- cells) displayed implant colonization and progressively increased aggrecan and collagen 2 mRNA, but significantly decreased push-out forces over time. Cell-loaded PGA showed significantly accelerated cell colonization and significantly extended deposition of aggrecan. Augmented chondrogenic differentiation in PGA and cartilage/PGA-interface for up to 84 days suggests initial cartilage regeneration. Due to the PGA resorbability, however, the model exhibits limitations in assessing the ""lateral implant bonding"".",0

There were 31 grafted lesions. At operation the findings included lifting (24/31) and detachment (3/31) of periosteal patches for which arthroscopic shaving was performed. Chondroplasty was undertaken on two new lesions, another required an ACI and a further patient required trimming of a meniscus. The mechanical symptoms resolved within two weeks. At the last review, two to 14 months from reoperation; 68% had improved, and 86% had normal or nearly normal IKDC scores. Of the 31 lesions, 30 (97%) had normal or nearly normal visual repair scores. Biopsy showed good integration with subchondral bone and the marginal interface in all specimens, most of which showed hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage (70%). Troublesome mechanical symptoms required surgery in 13% of ACI-treated patients and were attributed to periosteal extrusion. Simple arthroscopic debridement was curative.",0

A total of 14 patients underwent arthroscopy of the knee for a chronic lesion on the femoral condyles or trochlea. In addition to the routine cartilage biopsy, a second biopsy of cartilage was taken from the edge of the lesion. The cells isolated from both sources underwent parallel cultivation as monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) alginate culture. The cell yield, viability, capacity for proliferation, morphology and the expressions of typical cartilage genes (collagen I, COL1; collagen II, COL2; aggrecan, AGR; and versican, VER) were assessed. The cartilage differentiation indices (COL2/COL1, AGR/VER) were calculated. The control biopsies revealed a higher mean cell yield (1346 cells/mg vs 341 cells/mg), but similar cell proliferation, viability and morphology compared with the cells from the edge of the lesion. The cartilage differentiation indices were superior in control cells: COL2/COL1 (threefold in biopsies (non-significant)); sixfold in monolayer cultures (p = 0.012), and 7.5-fold in hydrogels (non-significant), AGR/VER (sevenfold in biopsies (p = 0.04), threefold (p = 0.003) in primary cultures and 3.5-fold in hydrogels (non-significant)). Our results suggest that the cultivation of chondrocytes solely from the edges of the lesion cannot be recommended for use in autologous chondrocyte implantation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2013.03.009,Comparative biomechanical analysis of human and caprine knee articular cartilage,"The goat is one of the most commonly used preclinical models for focal defect repair and regeneration. While the biomechanics of the human knee has been studied extensively, less is known about the biomechanics of the caprine knee. Differences between human and caprine knees have not been quantified and their significance is largely unknown.We conducted a biomechanical analysis of the differences in goat and human knees to assess the validity of these preclinical in vivo models.CT and MRI scans revealed several differences in articular geometry: the caprine tibial plateaux were more convex and the menisci were significantly thicker and covered a larger proportion of the tibial articular surface. Caprine cartilage thickness was consistently thinner, while elastic modulus on indentation testing was consistently stiffer than human cartilage measured at eight different articular locations. Contact area and pressure were measured with electronic pressure sensors under loads normalized by multiples of body weight and at knee flexion angles reported for walking. The highest peaks in contact pressure were measured in the patellofemoral joint in goat and human knees. Peak contact pressure measured at 2 times body weight at the goat tibiofemoral joint at 70° flexion was significantly higher than for any other condition at the human tibiofemoral joint.These differences in contact conditions might explain the lower quality of local repair reported for caprine femoral condylar defects relative to trochlear defects. Further comparative analysis, including biologic response, is necessary to determine the extent to which the goat knee reproduces clinical conditions.",0

T2 mapping and delayed Gadolinium Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cartilage (dGEMRIC) were used to gain first data on the biochemical properties of BioCart™II RT in vivo. <h3>Methods</h3> T2 mapping and dGEMRIC were performed at 3T in five patients (six knee joints) who had undergone ACI 15–27 months before. T2 maps were obtained using a pixel wise, mono-exponential non-negative least squares fit analysis. For quantitative T1 mapping a dual flip angle 3D GRE sequence was used and T1 maps were calculated pre- and post-contrast using IDL software. Subsequent region of interest analysis was carried out in comparison with morphologic MRI. <h3>Results</h3> A spatial variation of T2 values in both hyaline, normal cartilage (NC) and RT was found. Mean RT T2 values and mean NC T2 values did not differ significantly. Relative T2 values were calculated from global RT and NC T2 and showed a small range (0.84–1.07). The relative delta relaxation rates (rΔR1) obtained from the T1 maps had a wider range (0.77–4.91). <h3>Conclusion</h3> T2 mapping and dGEMRIC provided complementary information on the biochemical properties of the repair tissue. BioCart™II apparently can provide RT similar to hyaline articular cartilage and may become a less-invasive alternative to ACI with a periosteal flap.",0

Methods We implemented a pilot clinical study in two patients with knee osteochondral lesions using engineered tissue composed of scaffold and autologous chondrocytes. Patients were clinically evaluated using the International Repair Cartilage Society score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for one year. Results Improved clinical outcomes and objective scores indicated a normal or nearly normal knee in both patients. International Knee Documentation Committee score was upgraded from 34.5 at baseline to 72.4 in the first patient, and 28.7 to 81.6 in the second patient. Visual analogue scale, showing the suffering pain score, was lowered from 8 to 0 in both patients, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score representing the physical ability of the patients was changed from 68.1 to 87.1 in Patient 1 and 58.3 to 87.1 in Patient 2, the knee function score, related to the functional ability of the knee, was improved from 70 to 100 in the first patient and from 45 to 91 in the second patient. MRI showed great coverage and integration of the graft in patients, with no effusion, decreased edema and cartilage formation signals. Conclusions The functional and clinical outcomes alongside MRI data showed promising results for regenerating osteochondral defects. A randomized clinical trial study is required to confirm feasibility of this novel engineered tissue in repair of osteochondral defects.",0
,First successful autologous chondrocyte implantation in Pakistan.,"Osteochondritis dissecans entails a hyaline cartilage defect of the articular surface causing pain and functional restriction in young adults, sometimes resulting in early degenerative arthritis. Conventional treatment methods such as abrasion chondroplasty and mosaicplasty have limitations in terms of quality of the resultant cartilage and donor site morbidity. A more recent technique, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) results in hyaline cartilage formation and gives good long-term outcome, but requires a high-level cell culture facility and two surgical procedures. The patient was a young female with knee pain, intermittent locking and feeling of “joint mouse”. MRI scan and arthroscopy showed a 2x2 cm full thickness osteochondral defect in the medial femoral condyle. A free fragment of articular cartilage was found, which was extracted arthroscopically, and chondrocytes were cultured from it in the Juma laboratory. Subsequently, patient underwent surgery whereby the chondrocytes were injected under a periosteal patch sewn over the defect. Over six months, patient’s symptoms completely resolved and she returned to full function. A repeat arthroscopy after one year revealed complete filling of the previous defect with normal appearing cartilage indicating success of the procedure. This technology can be utilized for treating patients with a variety of conditions affecting hyaline cartilage of joints.",0

Purpose: To investigate the clinical and second-look arthroscopic results of the osteochondral autograft transfer system and to identify the prognostic factors associated with this procedure. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: The authors retrospectively evaluated 52 ankles that underwent osteochondral autograft transfer for a medial osteochondral lesion of the talus. Second-look arthroscopies were performed at a mean of 13.1 months postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and the Tegner activity scale. Statistical analyses were performed to identify various prognostic factors associated with the clinical outcomes. Results: The mean VAS, AOFAS, and Tegner activity scale scores were all significantly improved from 6.9 ± 0.9 to 3.3 ± 1.4 (VAS), from 67.4 ± 4.9 to 82.6 ± 7.8 (AOFAS), and from 3.0 ± 0.8 to 3.9 ± 0.9 (Tegner; P &lt; .05). Regarding overall patient satisfaction with the operation, 49 (95%) patients reported good to excellent results. Prognostic factors including the patient’s age, sex, body mass index, duration of symptoms, defect size and depth, location of osteochondral lesion of the talus, and the existence of a subchondral cyst did not significantly influence clinical outcomes ( P &gt; .05), except for body mass index on the Tegner activity scale score ( P = .021). Significant differences were observed among clinical outcomes for second-look arthroscopy according to the presence of soft tissue impingement and uncovered areas around the graft ( P &lt; .05). The VAS and AOFAS score at the last follow-up were significantly worse when the articular surface of the tibial plafond at the malleolar osteotomy site was uneven ( P = .031 and .012, respectively). Conclusion: This study showed that the articular surface of the tibial plafond at the malleolar osteotomy site, soft tissue impingement, and uncovered areas around the graft were important factors affecting the clinical outcomes, as observed through second-look arthroscopy. Therefore, surgeons should restore the articular surface accurately after the osteotomy, and more caution should be taken to avoid soft tissue impingement and uncovered areas around the graft when performing osteochondral autograft transfer.",0

For each treatment, 130 mL of subcutaneous adipose tissue was harvested using tumescent liposuction technique and manual aspiration of tissue from the thigh using a suction cannula under local anesthesia in the operating room. The adipose tissue harvested was processed using the Celution® Centrifuge in a dedicated cell processing room. The ADRCs were injected into the articular cavity of both knees for one patient and into a single affected knee in the second patient (three joints). Pain and knee function were assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Knee Outcome in Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS) respectively. The cartilage defect was assessed by direct visualization (arthroscopy). No serious adverse events were reported throughout follow-up. Pain and knee function were significantly improved from baseline in all treated knees at one, three and six months after ADRCs. At six-months after ADRCs treatment, the second-look arthroscopy showed that almost all the cartilage defect areas were covered by regenerated cartilage, some cartilage fibrillation area was reduced, and meniscus tear areas were repaired.Cartilage and meniscus repair were observed six-months after ADRCs therapy under second-look arthroscopy. It was shown that a single administration of ADRCs might be effective as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2018.00154,The Stromal Vascular Fraction From Fat Tissue in the Treatment of Osteochondral Knee Defect: Case Report,In this study we applied autologous fat tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in combination with microfracturing technique in a 36-year-old man with an osteochondral lesion of the medial femoral condyle 8 months after the injury. Cell material was generated by fat tissue liposuction from the anterior abdominal wall with subsequent extraction of the SVF and injected through a mini-arthrotomy portal with subsequent fibrin sealant fixation. The follow-up period was 2 years. Clinical score improved from 23 to 96 according to IKDC and from 10 to 90 according to EQ-VAS at 24 months follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the surgery revealed an osteochondral lesion with development of significant trabecular edema that remained unchanged for 6 months despite conservative treatment. MRI 1 and 2 years after the surgery showed the recovery of the damaged cartilage thickness with somewhat uneven structure and a decrease in the trabecular edema of the femoral condyle. The use of SVF cells with fibrin sealant fixation might be a promising approach in the treatment of osteochondral joint lesions. Further studies are required.,0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2017.08.309,Clinical Outcomes of Single Anteromedial Bundle Biologic Augmentation Technique for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Consideration of Tibial Remnant Size,"The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the functional outcomes, knee stability, complications, and reoperations associated with anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the single anteromedial bundle biological augmentation (SAMBBA) technique in a consecutive series of 128 patients with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. A secondary aim was to compare larger preserved ACL remnants with smaller preserved remnants.Patients who underwent primary anatomic ACL reconstruction using the SAMBBA technique from July 2013 to October 2014 were analyzed. Exclusion criteria were (1) age <16 years, (2) revision cases, (3) multiple ligament injuries, (4) chondral lesions greater than grade 2 according to the Outerbridge classification, (5) additional injuries to the collateral ligaments greater than grade 2, or (6) a history of a contralateral ACL injury. Clinical assessment including evaluation of side-to-side difference and functional outcome measures with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and the Tegner Activity Scale were used to evaluate outcomes before surgery and at the last follow-up. Any subsequent surgical procedures were systematically recorded during the study period. The patients were also divided in 2 groups according to their ACL remnant size, ≥50% or <50%, and compared.Of the 135 patients who underwent primary SAMBBA technique, 128 patients returned to final follow-up, with a mean follow-up of 31.7 months (range, 24-44.3). At last follow-up, the IKDC score significantly improved from 54.1 ± 15.1 to 92.5 ± 11.4 (P < .001); the Tegner activity score (6.4 ± 1.2) was similar (P = .3) to the preinjury score (6.5 ± 1.2). Side-to-side laxity significantly improved from 6.7 ± 1.2 mm to 0.7 ± 1 mm (P < .001). Twenty-four subsequent surgeries (18.7%) were performed including 10 meniscal procedures, 7 ACL revisions, 5 arthroscopies for cyclops lesions, one microfracture, and one manipulation under anaesthesia. The side-to-side laxity (P = .30) and rates of reoperation (P = .65), graft failure (P = .45), and cyclops lesions (P = .67) were not significantly different between ≥50% or <50% ACL remnant groups.The results of this study demonstrate that primary anatomic ACL reconstruction using the SAMBBA technique significantly improved clinical and functional outcomes between baseline and follow-up at a minimum of 24 months. A low rate of complications was observed with this technique. No significant differences between large and moderate size ACL remnants were detected for all outcome measures.Level IV case series with subgroup analysis.",0

The study population comprised 22 patients (mean age: 39 years), prospectively assessed before surgery, at 24 and 60 months’ follow-up. Inclusion criteria were: at least two episodes of knee pain for more than 10 days in the last year, Kellgren-Lawrence OA grade 0, I or II and arthroscopic or MRI findings according to the European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery &amp; Arthroscopy (ESSKA) criteria. Clinical results demonstrated significant improvement in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores and in Tegner score, although activity level never reached the pre-injury level. The complication rate of this study was 8.3%. Two patients underwent re-operation (8.3%), while a comprehensive definition of failure (including both surgical and clinical criteria) identified four failed patients (16.6%) at this mid-term follow-up evaluation. The use of a free-cell osteochondral scaffold represented a safe and valid alternative for the treatment of focal articular cartilage defects in the setting of an EOA, and was able to permit a significant clinical improvement and stable outcome with low complication and failure rates.",0

The three-dimensional biomimetic scaffold (Fin-Ceramica Faenza S.p.A., Faenza-Italy) was obtained by nucleating collagen fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, in two configurations, bi- and tri-layered, to reproduce, respectively, chondral and osteochondral anatomy. Chondral defects (lateral condyle) and deep osteochondral defects (medial condyle) were made in the distal epiphysis of the third metacarpal bone of both forelimbs of two adult horses and treated respectively with the chondral and osteochondral grafts. Both animals were euthanised six months follow up. The images obtained at the second look arthroscopy evaluation, performed two months after surgery, demonstrated good filling of the chondral and osteo-chondral defects without any inflammatory reaction around and inside the lesions. At the histological analysis the growth of trabecular bone in the osteochondral lesion was evident. Only in one case, the whole thickness of the osteochondral lesion was filled by fibrocartilaginous tissue. The formation of a tidemark line was evident at the interface with the newly formed bone. Newly formed fibrocartilaginous tissue was present in the area of the chondral defect. Initial alignment of the collagen fibres was recognisable with polarised light in both groups. The results of the present pilot study showed that this novel osteochondral and chondral scaffold may act as a suitable matrix to facilitate orderly regeneration of bone and hyaline-like cartilage.",0

While safety and promising results have been suggested, there are no trials proving the real potential of the osteochondral regenerative approach. Aim was to assess the benefit provided by a nanostructured collagen-hydroxyapatite (coll-HA) multilayer scaffold for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral knee lesions.In this multicentre randomized controlled clinical trial, 100 patients affected by symptomatic chondral and osteochondral lesions were treated and evaluated for up to 2 years (51 study group and 49 control group). A biomimetic coll-HA scaffold was studied, and bone marrow stimulation (BMS) was used as reference intervention. Primary efficacy measurement was IKDC subjective score at 2 years. Secondary efficacy measurements were: KOOS, IKDC Knee Examination Form, Tegner and VAS Pain scores evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 months. Tissue regeneration was evaluated with MRI MOCART scoring system at 6, 12 and 24 months. An external independent agency was involved to ensure data correctness and objectiveness.A statistically significant improvement of all clinical scores was obtained from basal evaluation to 2-year follow-up in both groups, although no overall statistically significant differences were detected between the two treatments. Conversely, the subgroup of patients affected by deep osteochondral lesions (i.e. Outerbridge grade IV and OCD) showed a statistically significant better IKDC subjective outcome (+12.4 points, p = 0.036) in the coll-HA group. Statistically significant better results were also found for another challenging group: sport active patients (+16.0, p = 0.027). Severe adverse events related to treatment were documented only in three patients in the coll-HA group and in one in the BMS group. The MOCART score showed no statistical difference between the two groups.This study highlighted the safety and potential of a biomimetic implant. While no statistically significant differences were found compared to BMS for chondral lesions, this procedure can be considered a suitable option for the treatment of osteochondral lesions.I.",1

Age has been considered as a limiting factor and the technique has not been recommended in patients older than 40 to 50 years. Nevertheless, some more recent studies report satisfying clinical results in middle-aged patients. Hypothesis Analogous to the microfracture technique, age over 40 years is associated with inferior clinical outcome after ACI. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods Thirty-seven patients with an average age of 47.8 years (group 1) were matched with 37 patients with an average age of 31 years (group 2). Both groups underwent ACI for treatment of isolated cartilage defects of the knee. All patients were enrolled prospectively and followed for a period of 24 months using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm scale, Cincinnati sports scale, and Tegner activity evaluation instruments. Results Statistical analysis revealed a significant increase in function after ACI in both groups as early as 6 months after surgery until the end of the study period. There was only a slight tendency for better clinical outcome in younger patients (IKDC at 24 months: group 1, 72.2 ± 15.8 [standard deviation]; group 2: 76.1 ± 14.1; P = .261; Lysholm at 24 months: group 1: 80.42 ± 15.37; group 2: 80.65 ± 12.01), no statistical significant differences were found between patients of group 1 and group 2 at any of the time points investigated. Conclusion In contrast to other cartilage repair techniques, patients 40 years and older do not have an inferior outcome up to 24 months after ACI for isolated cartilage defects when compared with younger patients.",0

The present study attempted to combine the advantages of porous scaffold and hydrogel in delivering chondrocytes to partial-thickness cartilage defects. An electrospun, gelatin-incorporated PLCL scaffold mechanically similar to natural cartilage was fabricated, and chondrocytes were seeded using an injectable heparin-based hydrogel for efficient cell seeding. The scaffold/hydrogel composite showed more enhanced expression of chondrogenic genes and production of GAGs than those prepared without hydrogel. In addition, significant cartilage formation showing good integration with surrounding, similar to natural cartilage, was observed by scaffold/hydrogel composite system in partial-thickness defects of rabbit knees while no regeneration was observed in control defects. Although no exogenous chondrogenic factors were added, it was evident that the scaffold/hydrogel composite system was highly effective and better than the scaffold alone system without hydrogel for cartilage regeneration both in vitro and in vivo.",0

In fact, to promote the growth of articular cartilage and subchondral bone is a real challenge, due to the different functional and anatomical properties. To this purpose, alginate is a promising biomaterial for a scaffold-based approach, claiming optimal biocompatibility and good chondrogenic potential. A previously developed mineralized alginate scaffold was investigated in terms of the ability to support osteochondral regeneration both in a large and medium size animal model. The results were evaluated macroscopically and by microtomography, histology, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical analysis. No evidence of adverse or inflammatory reactions was observed in both models, but limited subchondral bone formation was present, together with a slow scaffold resorption time. The implantation of this biphasic alginate scaffold provided partial osteochondral regeneration in the animal model. Further studies are needed to evaluate possible improvement in terms of osteochondral tissue regeneration for this biomaterial.",0

MSCs labeled with ferumoxide by simple incubation, protamine transfection, or Lipofectin transfection were evaluated with MRI and histopathology. Ferumoxide-labeled and unlabeled viable and apoptotic MSCs in osteochondral defects of rat knee joints were evaluated over 12 weeks with MRI. Signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of viable and apoptotic labeled MASIs were tested for significant differences using t-tests. A simple incubation labeling protocol demonstrated the best compromise between significant magnetic resonance signal effects and preserved cell viability and potential for immediate clinical translation. Labeled viable and apoptotic MASIs did not show significant differences in SNR. Labeled viable but not apoptotic MSCs demonstrated an increasing area of T-2 signal loss over time, which correlated to stem cell proliferation at the transplantation site. Histopathology confirmed successful engraftment of viable MSCs. The engraftment of iron oxide-labeled MASIs by simple incubation can be monitored over several weeks with MRI. Viable and apoptotic MASIs can be distinguished via imaging signs of cell proliferation at the transplantation site.",0
https://doi.org/10.3810/psm.2013.05.2017,Surgical Restoration/Repair of Articular Cartilage Injuries in Athletes,"Articular cartilage injuries of the knee are an increasingly common source of pain and dysfunction, particularly in the athletic population. In the athlete, untreated articular cartilage defects can represent a career threatening injury and create a significant obstacle in returning to full athletic participation. The markedly limited healing potential of articular cartilage often leads to continued deterioration and progressive functional limitations. Numerous studies have shown that full thickness articular cartilage lesions are frequently encountered at the time of arthroscopy, particularly associated with athletic injury. A variety of surgical treatment options exist, including debridement, microfracture, osteochondral autograft, osteochondral allograft, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. Each technique has advantages and limitations for restoring articular cartilage function, and emerging technology continues to improve the results of treatment. Our article provides an evidence-based review on the etiology and prevalence of articular cartilage injuries in athletes, along with the principles and techniques available for restoring articular cartilage function following injury.",0

Studies with growth factors, implantation of autologous chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells have led to variable, to some extent inconsistent, results. This work compares osteochondral knee-defect repair in rabbits upon implantation of a previously described alginate/(poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) osteochondral scaffold in distinct conditions. Systems were either in vitro pre-cultured with a small number of allogeneic chondrocytes under fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 stimulation or the same amount of allogeneic, marrow derived, mesenchymal stem cells (without any pre-differentiation), or loaded with microsphere-encapsulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 within the alginate layer, or holding combinations of one or the other cell type with BMP-2. The experimental limit was 12 weeks, because a foregoing study with this release system had shown a maintained tissue response for at least 24 weeks post-operation. After only 6 weeks, histological analyses revealed newly formed cartilage-like tissue, which resembled the adjacent, normal cartilage in cell as well as BMP-2 treated defects, but cell therapy gave higher histological scores. This advantage evened out until 12 weeks. Combinations of cells and BMP-2 did not result in any additive or synergistic effect. Equally efficient osteochondral defect repair was achieved with chondrocyte, stem cell, and BMP-2 treatment. Expression of collagen X and collagen I, signs of ongoing ossification, were histologically undetectable, and the presence of aggrecan protein indicated cartilage-like tissue. In conclusion, further work should demonstrate whether spatiotemporally controlled, on-site BMP-2 release alone could become a feasible therapeutic approach to repair large osteochondral defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.teb.2019.0140,Systematic Review of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells for Cartilage Regeneration,"Background: Symptomatic cartilage lesions and early osteoarthritis produce significant clinical and economic burdens. Cartilage repair can improve the symptoms and delay arthroplasty. The complete healing of damaged cartilage with the consistent reproduction of normal hyaline cartilage has not yet been achieved. The choice of harvesting site might influence the cells' abilities to modulate immunologic and inflammatory responses. Recently, dental pulp has been shown to contain a stem cell niche consisting of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) that maintain their self-renewal capacity due to the active environment in the dental pulp of deciduous teeth. Objective: The aim of this study was to critically review the current literature on the potential and limitations of the use of dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells in cell-based therapies for cartilage regeneration. Methods: An electronic, customized search of scientific articles was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from their inception to December 2018. The inclusion criteria were applied, and the articles that described the use of DPSC in cartilage treatment were selected for complete evaluation. The articles were classified according to the scaffold used, experimental model, chondrogenic differentiation features, defect location, cartilage evaluation, and results. After the application of the eligibility criteria, a total of nine studies were selected and fully analyzed. Results: A variety of animal models were used, including mice, rats, rabbits, and miniature pigs, to evaluate the quality and safety of human DPSCs in the repair of cartilage defects. Among the articles, two studies focused on preclinical models of cartilage tissue engineering. Five studies implanted DPSCs in other animal sites. Conclusion: The use of DPSCs is a potential new stem cell therapy for articular cartilage repair. The preclinical evidence discussed in this article provides a solid foundation for future clinical trials. Impact statement Osteoarthritis presents an ever-increasing clinical and socioeconomic burden. While cartilage repair has the potential to improve symptoms and delay joint replacement, complete regeneration of hyaline cartilage has been an elusive goal. Dental pulp has been shown to contain a niche that protects dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) from the cumulative effects of genetic and environmental factors and maintains their self-renewal capacity due to the active environment. Transplantation and preclinical trials have demonstrated the strong potential of regenerative tissue-engineering protocols using DPSCs.",0

Regenerative medicine provides novel concepts for curing them. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of perfusion and cyclic compression on cell differentiation and mechanical properties using a custom-made biomechanoreactor in a recently established system of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) cultured in a 3-D collagen I-bone hybrid matrix out of commercially available and separately in human-certified products. Seeded hBMSC were viable for 88 +/- A 8.9% during the entire experimental period in the constructs. GAG and DNA levels did not change. Perfusion induced collagen II and cyclic compression increased collagen X expression. Matrix stiffness was significantly increased after 28 days of cyclic compression. Cyclic compression of cell-loaded hybrid constructs enhanced chondrocyte differentiation and matrix stiffness. This system is a promising tool with a view to a later clinical application.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-021-06513-y,Matrix-induced chondrogenesis is a valid and safe cartilage repair option for small- to medium-sized cartilage defects of the knee: a systematic review,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing the results of matrix-induced chondrogenesis with other therapies for local chondral lesions of the knee. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCT) about matrix-induced chondrogenesis for focal chondral lesions in the knee was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Data source was PubMed central, EMBASE and Google scholar. RESULTS: Five articles could be included, whereas two originated from the same study group. Three studies compared matrix-induced chondrogenesis to microfracture (MFx) only. One trial compared AMIC(®) to collagen-covered autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI-C). One study assessed the improvements given by the combination of AMIC(®) with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). In three studies, clinical improvements compared to baseline were seen at 2-year postoperation, irrespective of the technique used. After 5 years, one trial showed better results for the AMIC(®) group compared to MFx, including MRI defect filling. One study showed also good results after AMIC(®) with faster recovery for patients with AMIC(®) + BMAC 12 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Results of RCTs comparing matrix-induced chondrogenesis with other treatment options showed that matrix-induced chondrogenesis is a valid and safe cartilage repair option for small- to medium-sized cartilage defects of the knee. This one-stage surgical technique presents a good alternative for patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.08.030,Cartilage repair using an in vitro generated scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct derived from porcine synovial mesenchymal stem cells,"The objective was to in vitro generate a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based tissue-engineered construct (TEC) to facilitate in vivo repair in a porcine chondral defect model. Porcine synovial MSCs were cultured in monolayer at high density and were subsequently detached from the substratum. The cell/matrix complex spontaneously contracted to develop a basic TEC. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the basic TEC contained collagen I and III, fibronectin, and vitronectin. The basic TEC exhibited stable adhesion to the surface of a porcine cartilage matrix in an explant culture system. The TEC cultured in chondrogenic media exhibited elevated expression of glycosaminoglycan and chondrogenic marker genes. The TEC were implanted in vivo into chondral defects in the medial femoral condyle of 4-month-old pigs, followed by sacrifice after 6 months. Implantation of a TEC into chondral defects initiated repair with a chondrogenic-like tissue, as well as secure biological integration to the adjacent cartilage. Histologically, the repair tissue stained positively with Safranin O and for collagen II. Biomechanical evaluation revealed that repair tissue exhibited mechanical properties similar to those of normal porcine cartilage in static compression and friction tests. This technology is a unique and promising method for stem cell-based cartilage repair.",0

After isolation and culture, hMSCs were seeded on biphasic composite constructs (hydroxyapatite + PR-FG) and transplanted into osteochondral defects of adult New Zealand white rabbits. Treatment of individual defects was applied by random assignment to one of five groups: (1) control, defects untreated; (2) hydroxyapatite, defects filled with hydroxyapatite only; (3) hydroxyapatite + PR-FG, defects filled with a composite of hydroxyapatite and PR-FG; (4) hydroxyapatite + PR-FG + undifferentiated hMSCs; and (5) hydroxyapatite + PR-FG + differentiated hMSCs. Rabbits were killed at 4 or 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time osteochondral repair was macroscopically and histologically evaluated and scored using the modified International Cartilage Repair Society scoring system. The group in which defects were seeded with differentiated hMSCs (group 5) showed superior healing of osteochondral defects based on macroscopic and histological observations compared to other groups. Specifically, 8 weeks after implantation, defects were filled with more hyaline-like cartilage and were better integrated with the surrounding native cartilage. The histological scores were significantly better than those of other groups (16.3 at 8 weeks, p \textbackslashtextless 0.01). Xenogeneic transplantation of differentiated hMSCs using a biphasic composite construct effectively repaired osteochondral defect in a rabbit model. Differentiated hMSCs showed superior healing of chondral lesion to undifferentiated hMSCs.",0

A 1-year repair study in sheep was conducted.The repair tissues in the microfracture were mostly fibrous and had scattered fissures with degenerative changes. Cartilage regenerated with the gradient plugs had equal or superior mechanical properties; had lacunated cells and stable matrix as in hyaline cartilage.This first report of gradient scaffolds in a long-term, large animal, osteochondral defect demonstrated potential for equal or better cartilage repair than microfracture.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2016.07.044,"Effects of passage number and post-expansion aggregate culture on tissue engineered, self-assembled neocartilage","Chondrocyte dedifferentiation presents a major barrier in engineering functional cartilage constructs. To mitigate the effects of dedifferentiation, this study employed a post-expansion aggregate culture step to enhance the chondrogenic phenotype of passaged articular chondrocytes (ACs) before their integration into self-assembled neocartilage constructs. The objective was twofold: (1) to explore how passage number (P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7), with or without aggregate culture, affected construct properties; and (2) to determine the highest passage number that could form neocartilage with functional properties. Juvenile leporine ACs were passaged to P2-P7, with or without aggregate culture, and self-assembled into 5mm discs in non-adhesive agarose molds without using any exogenous scaffolds. Construct biochemical and biomechanical properties were assessed. With aggregate culture, neocartilage constructs had significantly higher collagen content, higher tensile properties, and flatter morphologies. These beneficial effects were most obvious at higher passage numbers. Specifically, collagen content, Young's modulus, and instantaneous compressive modulus in the P7, aggregate group were 53%, 116%, and 178% higher than those in the P7, non-aggregate group. Most interestingly, these extensively passaged P7 ACs (expansion factor of 85,000), which are typically highly dedifferentiated, were able to form constructs with properties similar to or higher than those formed by lower passage number cells. This study not only demonstrated that post-expansion aggregate culture could significantly improve the properties of self-assembled neocartilage, but also that chondrocytes of exceedingly high passage numbers, expanded using the methods in this study, could be used in cartilage engineering applications.This work demonstrated that extensively passaged chondrocytes (up to passage 7 (P7); expansion factor of 85,000) could potentially be used for cartilage tissue engineering applications. Specifically, an aggregate culture step, employed after cell expansion and before cell integration into a neocartilage construct, was shown to enhance the ability of the chondrocytes to form neocartilage with better biochemical and biomechanical properties. The beneficial effects of this aggregate culture step was especially noticeable at the high passage numbers. Most interestingly, P7 chondrocytes, which are typically highly dedifferentiated, were able to form neocartilage with properties similar to or higher than those formed by lower passage number cells. The ability to obtain high chondrocyte yields with an enhanced chondrogenic potential could have a broad, beneficial impact in improving current therapies (e.g., using higher cell seeding densities for repair) or developing new strategies that require high cell numbers, such as a scaffold-free approach in forming engineered cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/03009734.2011.552812,Therapeutic strategy of third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation for osteoarthritis,"Background.&nbsp;Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is considered a promising choice for the treatment of cartilage defects. However, the application of ACI to osteoarthritic patients is, in general, contraindicated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of three-dimensionallystructured ACI (3D-ACI; CaReS) in a rat model of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods.&nbsp;OA-like degenerative changes in the articular cartilage were created by transecting the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT) in athymic nude rats. Two weeks later, CaReS was transplanted at the cartilage injury sites created by micro-drilling in the patella groove (Chondrocyte-implanted (CI) group: CaReS collagen with human chondrocytes; Collagen group: CaReS collagen without cells; and Sham group: sham operation;&nbsp;n&nbsp;= 15/group). Results.&nbsp;Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated the expression of human-specific type 2 collagen and Sry-type high-mobility-group box 9 (SOX9) in the CI group—not in the other groups—throughout the study period. Double immunohistochemistry for human-specific type 2 collagen and human leukocyte antigen-abacavir (HLA-ABC) at week 4 showed positive staining in the CI group only. Macroscopic assessment showed better repair at the cartilage defect sites in the CI group, compared to the other groups. Histological assessment with toluidine blue staining showed that the thickness of the articular cartilage and semi-quantitative histological scores were higher in the CI group than in the other groups up to week 20. Conclusions.&nbsp;We demonstrate, for the first time, that 3D-ACI is effective in repairing cartilage defects in a rat model of ACLT-induced OA.",0

Methods Fifteen cases of arthroscopic autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee performed between November 2011 and October 2012 were included in the study. Medical charts and operational reports were screened and the patients were contacted after 0.8 +/- 0.3 years (0.4-1.3) and 4.3 +/- 0.3 years (4.0-4.8) to asses subjective IKDC and re-operation. The Tegner activity scale was collected at the second follow-up time point. Subjective IKDC response rates were assessed at both follow-up time points. Results The first and second follow-up was completed by all 15 patients (100%). The subjective IKDC scores showed a significant improvement (pre-operative 44.5 +/- 15.9, first follow-up 71.1 +/- 15.9, p \textbackslashtextless 0.001, second follow-up 72.6 +/- 17.3, p \textbackslashtextless 0.001). The overall response rate was 66.7% (n = 10) at follow-up one and two. There were no significant differences in pre-injury (4, range 1-9) and follow-up two (4, range 2-7) Tegner activity scales (p = n.s.). Two patients required re-operation in the index knee, not related to the ACI procedure. No complication related to the ACI or the implantation technique occurred. The histological results showed excellent cartilage regeneration. Conclusion Arthroscopic ACI using an in situ crosslinking matrix is a safe and reliable treatment option for full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2015.06.008,Assessment of glenoid chondral healing: comparison of microfracture to autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis in a novel rabbit shoulder model,"Management of glenohumeral arthrosis in young patients is a considerable challenge, with a growing need for non-arthroplasty alternatives. The objectives of this study were to develop an animal model to study glenoid cartilage repair and to compare surgical repair strategies to promote glenoid chondral healing.Forty-five rabbits underwent unilateral removal of the entire glenoid articular surface and were divided into 3 groups--untreated defect (UD), microfracture (MFx), and MFx plus type I/III collagen scaffold (autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis [AMIC])--for the evaluation of healing at 8 weeks (12 rabbits) and 32 weeks (33 rabbits) after injury. Contralateral shoulders served as unoperated controls. Tissue assessments included 11.7-T magnetic resonance imaging (long-term healing group only), equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast agent via micro-computed tomography (EPIC-μCT), and histologic investigation (grades on International Cartilage Repair Society II scoring system).At 8 weeks, x-ray attenuation, thickness, and volume did not differ by treatment group. At 32 weeks, the T2 index (ratio of T2 values of healing to intact glenoids) was significantly lower for the MFx group relative to the AMIC group (P = .01) whereas the T1ρ index was significantly lower for AMIC relative to MFx (P = .01). The micro-computed tomography-derived repair tissue volume was significantly higher for MFx than for UD. Histologic investigation generally suggested inferior healing in the AMIC and UD groups relative to the MFx group, which exhibited improvements in both integration of repair tissue with subchondral bone and tidemark formation over time.Improvements conferred by AMIC were limited to magnetic resonance imaging outcomes, whereas MFx appeared to promote increased fibrous tissue deposition via micro-computed tomography and more hyaline-like repair histologically. The findings from this novel model suggest that MFx promotes biologic resurfacing of full-thickness glenoid articular injury.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2003.11.012,Arthroscopic autologous chondrocyte implantation for the treatment of a chondral defect in the tibial plateau of the knee,"The matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI; Verigen, Leverküsen, Germany) is a tissue engineering technique for the treatment of deep chondral lesions. Cultured chondrocytes are seeded on a collagen membrane that can be implanted into the defect using exclusively fibrin glue. These features imply some surgical advantages with respect to the traditional ACI technique, such as the possibility of performing the procedure in articular sites, in which putting stitches for the periosteal patch is impossible. We report on the arthroscopic MACI technique for the treatment of a chondral defect of the knee. A 25-year-old man suffered persistent pain at the left knee after a violent direct trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arthroscopic examination at the time of cartilage biopsy revealed a 2-cm2 chondral lesion in the posterior portion of the lateral tibial plateau. The implantation procedure was performed through traditional arthroscopic portals, and the seeded membrane was fixed with fibrin glue, excluding water flow temporarily. Implant stability was verified intraoperatively, and filling of the defect was shown 12 months after surgery by MRI, which showed a hyaline-like cartilage signal. In this specific case, the arthroscopic approach allowed to achieve an optimal view of the lesion, without sacrificing any tendinous or ligamentous structure of the knee.",0

The aim of the present study is to investigate individual criteria for the development of graft hypertrophy by NOVOCART 3D implantation of the knee in the post-operative course of 2 years. Forty-one consecutive patients with 44 isolated cartilage defects of the knee were treated with NOVOCART 3D implants. Individual criteria and defect-associated criteria were collected. Follow-up MRIs were performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The NOVOCART 3D implants were measured and classified. The modified MOCART Score was used to evaluate quality and integration of the NOVOCART 3D implants in MRI. Graft hypertrophy was observed in a total of 11 patients at all post-operative time points. We were able to show that NOVOCART 3D implantation of cartilage defects after acute trauma and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) led to a significantly increased proportion of graft hypertrophy. No other individual criteria (age, gender, BMI) or defect-associated criteria (concomitant surgery, second-line treatment, defect size, fixation technique) showed any influence on the development of graft hypertrophy. The modified MOCART Score results revealed a significant post-operative improvement within 2 years. The aetiology of cartilage defects appears to have a relevant influence for the development of graft hypertrophy. Patients, who were treated with NOVOCART 3D implants after an acute event (acute trauma or OCD), are especially at risk for developing a graft hypertrophy in the post-operative course of two years.

Articular cartilage has limited, if any, capacity to heal and/or regenerate. Although the natural history of articular cartilage lesions has not been clearly studied, significant injuries are believed to progress, resulting in degenerative arthritis of the joint. Changes have been made in surgical techniques in an attempt to better manage these lesions, and a large industry has been built around arthroscopic and open surgical procedures for managing cartilage repair. However, there is limited evidence that any intervention significantly alters the natural history of these lesions. Randomized trials have been done to examine the outcomes of common restoration procedures performed in the United States today, such as microfracture, osteochondral autograft transfer, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. Because the natural history of articular cartilage lesions has not been defined, we can assess the utility of surgical interventions only by comparing methods.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0885328215604069,A bioactive hybrid three-dimensional tissue-engineering construct for cartilage repair,"The aim was to develop a hybrid three-dimensional-tissue engineering construct for chondrogenesis. The hypothesis was that they support chondrogenesis. A biodegradable, highly porous polycaprolactone-grate was produced by solid freeform fabrication. The polycaprolactone support was coated with a chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet produced by electrospinning. Transforming growth factor-β3-induced chondrogenesis was followed using the following markers: sex determining region Y/-box 9, runt-related transcription factor 2 and collagen II and X in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology and immunostaining. A polycaprolactone-grate and an optimized chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet supported cellular aggregation, chondrogenesis and matrix formation. In tissue engineering constructs, the sheets were seeded first with mesenchymal stem cells and then piled up according to the lasagne principle. The advantages of such a construct are (1) the cells do not need to migrate to the tissue engineering construct and therefore pore size and interconnectivity problems are omitted and (2) the cell-tight nanofibre sheet and collagen-fibre network mimic a cell culture platform for mesenchymal stem cells/chondrocytes (preventing escape) and hinders in-growth of fibroblasts and fibrous scarring (preventing capture). This allows time for the slowly progressing, multiphase true cartilage regeneration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/bpo.0000000000000212,Trochlear Groove Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Knee Patellofemoral Joint,"The trochlear groove is the rarest location for osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee, with only about 50 previously reported cases, most of which were treated before the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and modern techniques of cartilage fixation or osteochondral transplantation. The purpose of this multicenter study was to assess the patient presentation and clinical, radiographic, and functional results of treatment for trochlear groove OCD lesions.Hospital records from 5 institutions of the Research in Osteochondritis of the Knee (ROCK) study group were retrospectively reviewed for cases of trochlear groove OCD. Demographics, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, time to pain resolution, and return to sports were recorded. Lesion appearance, size, stability, and time to radiographic healing were evaluated on plain x-rays and MRIs.Trochlear groove OCD lesions were evaluated in 24 knees in 21 adolescents (17 male, 4 female), with an average age of 14 years (range, 10 to 18 y). Fifty-four percent (13/24) of the lesions were identifiable on radiographs, and all were identifiable on MRI, 38% of which (9/24) was unstable. One fourth (6/24) of knees had coexistent femoral condyle OCD lesions. Treatment outcomes were evaluated in patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up (average: 3 y; range: 1 to 12 y) or healing before 1 year. Half of the knees (2/4) treated nonoperatively and two thirds (8/12) treated operatively showed radiographic signs of healing with patients returning to full activity without pain. Operative treatment success rates were as follows: drilling (3/3), fixation (3/3), microfracture (1/2), drilling with subsequent delayed microfracture (1/1), and drilling with fixation (0/3).MRI aids in the diagnosis and staging of trochlear groove OCD lesions, as almost one half may not be identifiable on radiographs, and one quarter are associated with OCD lesions in other locations of the same knee. Multiple operative treatments can be used to achieve healing or resolution of symptoms in stable and unstable lesions; however, a larger comparative study is needed to make specific recommendations.Therapeutic Level IV.",0

The clinical application of the regenerative approach is well documented for different types of scaffold but mostly with an evaluation of the clinical outcome at short-term follow-up. Purpose: This study was conducted to analyze the clinical outcome obtained with arthroscopic second-generation ACI up to 7 years’ follow-up, to assess the durability of the results, and understand its real potential over time. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Sixty-two consecutive patients, 48 men and 14 women with a mean age of 28.1 ± 11.4 years, affected by chondral lesions of the femoral condyles were enrolled and treated with arthroscopic implantation of the bioengineered tissue Hyalograft C. The average size of the defects was 2.5 ± 1.0 cm 2 . Patients were evaluated with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and Tegner scores every year for 7 years, and a magnetic resonance imaging evaluation was performed. Results: A statistically significant improvement was observed in all scores from the basal evaluation to the 84 months’ follow-up. The IKDC subjective score increased from 39.6 ± 15.0 to 73.6 ± 18.8 at 12 months; a further slight improvement was observed at 24 months’ follow-up (76.5 ± 20.7), and then the results were stable and reached a final 7-year value of 77.3 ± 21.5. Seven cases (11%) failed. A better outcome was obtained in young active men, whereas the worst results were found in degenerative lesions or when previous surgery had been performed. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging studies in 42 cases revealed a complete filling of the cartilage defect in 57% of the lesions, complete integration of the graft in 62% of cases, intact repair tissue surface in 50%, homogeneous repair tissue structure in 43%, and a graft signal-intensity score that was isointense with the adjacent native cartilage in 43% and 48% of the cases in dual T2–fast spin echo and 3-dimensional gradient echo with fat suppression sequences, respectively. Conclusion: The analysis of this group of homogeneous patients, prospectively evaluated every year for 7 years, shows that this bioengineered approach with the proper indications may offer good and stable clinical results over time.",0

The original method using a periostal flap has been improved by using cell-seeded scaffolds for implantation, the matrix-based autologous chondrocyte implantation (mb-ACI) procedure. Uniform nationwide guidelines for post-ACI rehabilitation do not exist. A survey was conducted among the members of the clinical tissue regeneration study group concerning the current rehabilitation protocols and the members of the study group published recommendations for postoperative rehabilitation and treatment after ACI based on the results of this survey. There was agreement on fundamentals concerning a location-specific rehabilitation protocol (femoral condyle vs. patellofemoral joint). With regard to weight bearing and range of motion a variety of different protocols exist. Similar to this total agreement on the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for postsurgical care was found but again a great variety of different protocols exist. This manuscript summarizes the recommendations of the members of the German clinical tissue regeneration study group on postsurgical rehabilitation and MRI assessment after ACI (level IVb/EBM).",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40634-015-0031-3,Experimental articular cartilage repair in the Göttingen minipig: the influence of multiple defects per knee,"A gold standard treatment for articular cartilage injuries is yet to be found, and a cost-effective and predictable large animal model is needed to bridge the gap between in vitro studies and clinical studies. Ideally, the animal model should allow for testing of clinically relevant treatments and the biological response should be reproducible and comparable to humans. This allows for a reliable translation of results to clinical studies.This study aimed at verifying the Göttingen minipig as a pre-clinical model for articular cartilage repair by testing existing clinical cartilage repair techniques and evaluating the use of two defects per knee.Sixteen fully mature Göttingen minipigs were used. The minipigs received bilateral trochlear osteochondral drill-hole defects or chondral defects (Ø 6 mm), either one defect per knee or two defects per knee. The defects were treated with one of the following: Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI), microfracture (MFx), autologous-dual-tissue transplantation (ADTT), autologous bone graft, autologous cartilage chips. Empty chondral and osteochondral defects were used as controls. MRI and CT were performed 3 and 6 month, histology was performed 6 month postoperative.The repair tissue varied in morphology from non-cartilaginous fibrous tissue to fibrocartilaginous tissue as seen on MRI, CT and histology at 6 month. The worst results were seen in the empty controls, while the best results were achieved with the MACI and ADTT treatment. The use of two defects per knee did not have any significant effect on the repair response.The outcomes of the applied treatments were consistent with the outcomes in clinical studies and it was possible to apply two defects per knee. The Göttingen minipig model was easy to handle, cost-effective and provided predictable outcome. Based on this study the use of two defects per knee, one in the medial and one in the lateral trochlear facet, in male Göttingen minipigs is recommended.",0

However, SF-MSC characterization and chondrogenicity in collagen sponges have been poorly documented as well as their hypothetical in vivo chondroprotective properties with intra-articular injections during experimental osteoarthritis (OA).SF-MSCs were isolated from human SF aspirates in patients suffering from advanced OA undergoing total knee joint replacements. SF-MSCs at passage 2 (P2) were characterized by flow cytometry for epitope profiling. SF-MSCs at P2 were subsequently cultured in vitro to assess their multilineage potentials. To assess their chondrogenicity, SF-MSCs at P4 were seeded in collagen sponges for 4 weeks under various oxygen tensions and growth factors combinations to estimate their gene profile and matrix production. Also, SF-MSCs were injected into the joints in a nude rat anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) to macroscopically and histologically assess their possible chondroprotective properties,.We characterized the stemness (CD73+, CD90+, CD105+, CD34-, CD45-) and demonstrated the multilineage potency of SF-MSCs in vitro. Furthermore, the chondrogenic induction (TGF-ß1 ± BMP-2) of these SF-MSCs in collagen sponges demonstrated a good capacity of chondrogenic gene induction and extracellular matrix synthesis. Surprisingly, hypoxia did not enhance matrix synthesis, although it boosted chondrogenic gene expression (ACAN, SOX9, COL2A1). Besides, intra-articular injections of xenogenic SF-MSCs did exert neither chondroprotection nor inflammation in ACLT-induced OA in the rat knee.Advanced OA SF-MSCs seem better candidates for cell-based constructs conceived for cartilage defects rather than intra-articular injections for diffuse OA.",0

Comparison of morphological, histological and mechanical performance of the repair tissue was made with defects repaired using a synthetic polymer scaffold. Defects were created in the medial femoral condyle (MFC) and lateral trochlear sulcus (LTS) of Boer Cross goats and evaluated at 12 and 26weeks. It was found that the total histology score of the collagen–GAG based biomaterial (23.8; SD 1.7) provided a significant improvement (p<0.05) over the biphasic PLGA material (19;3) and the empty control defect (17.3;1.2) in the LTS. The overall trajectory of histological and morphological improvement between 12 and 26weeks was found to be higher for the collagen–GAG scaffold compared to the PLGA material. The occurrence of sub-chondral bone cysts was lower for the collagen–GAG scaffold with an incidence of 17% of defects, compared to 67% for the PLGA material at 26weeks. The cartilage repair tissue for both materials evaluated was superior after 26weeks implantation than the empty control with 75% of the collagen-GAG-treated defects showing markedly more hyaline-like cartilage and 50% of the PLGA sites exhibiting hyaline-like appearances, compared to 17% for the empty control. These early stage data indicate biphasic scaffolds based on collagen–GAG and PLGA both provide indications of satisfactory development of a structural repair to surgically prepared osteochondral defects. Furthermore, the biomaterial composition of the collagen–GAG may provide a more favourable environment for osteochondral repair.",0

New surgical treatment options are now available to treat this clinical entity. Diagnosis is made easier by improved magnetic resonance imaging protocols that better visualize articular cartilage. On physical examination, patients at any age can have joint surface damage and primarily experience joint line tenderness and pain with activity. Treatment options include debridement of nonviable cartilage with abrasion or microfracture of the subchondral bone, transplantation of autologous osteochondral plugs, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, transplantation of cadaveric allogenic osteochondral grafts, and, for irreparable damage, total knee arthroplasty. These newer treatment options show promising early and intermediate results.",0

Methods Database searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases up to 30 November 2018, for clinical studies in humans that assessed surgical outcomes of enhanced microfracture procedures in focal cartilage injuries of the knee. The clinical, functional and imaging outcomes were assessed and summarized. The MINORS scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies included. Results Ten studies were included comprising a total of 331 patients (mean age of 37.0 +/- 5.5 years, body mass 25.2 +/- 1.7 kg m(2), 56% male and 42% left knee), 278 femoral condyle chondral defects (147 medial, 35 lateral and 78 undefined) and 43 chondral defects distributed by the tibial plateau, patella and femoral trochlea. The chondral defects were mostly Outerbridge grade III or IV and the mean defect size was 3.2 +/- 0.6 cm(2). Studies consistently demonstrated significant improvement in the patient-reported outcome measures from baseline to final follow-up. Overall, imaging outcomes showed inconsistent results. Treatment-related adverse events were poorly reported. Conclusion Enhanced microfracture techniques significantly result in improved patient-reported outcome measures over the MCID, but provide inconsistent imaging results. Current clinical evidence does not allow for unequivocal recommendation of enhanced microfracture to treat symptomatic focal grade III/IV knee cartilage lesions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1039/c3bm00199g,Preparation of porous PLGA/Ti biphasic scaffold and osteochondral defect repair,"In this study, a porous PLGA/Ti biphasic scaffold was prepared and its potential to repair osteochondral defects was evaluated. The microstructure and mechanical properties of porous PLGA and porous Ti and their interface were characterized. The as-prepared biphasic scaffolds were implanted into rabbit knees for 1 and 3 months (PLGA/Ti group), and the porous PLGA (PLGA group) or empty defect (Untreated group) was also used. The results showed that both porous PLGA and porous Ti had an interconnected porous structure. The mechanical strength of porous PLGA and porous Ti was similar to that of cartilage and subchondral bone, respectively. The interface analysis revealed that the as-prepared biphasic scaffold had good overall integrity and interface stability. The gross observation and histological evaluation of specimens showed that hyaline-like cartilage filled the defects to a certain extent at 3 months for both PLGA/Ti and PLGA groups while the defects remained in an untreated group. In the PLGA/Ti group, better cartilage and subchondral bone repair was observed, and quantitative macroscopic and histological score evaluations confirmed this result, indicating that the porous biphasic PLGA/Ti scaffold had good biocompatibility and the best osteochondral defect repair ability in this study. The as-prepared porous biphasic scaffold showed the potential to be used in osteochondral tissue engineering for osteochondral defect repair.",0

We investigated whether image-guided methods (optically guided and template guided) can improve the outcome of these procedures.Fifteen sheep were operated to create traumatic chondral injuries in each knee. After 4 months, the chondral defect in one knee was repaired using (a) conventional approach, (b) optically guided method, or (c) template-guided method. For both image-guided groups, harvest and delivery sites were preoperatively planned using custom-made software. During optically guided surgery, instrument position and orientation were tracked and superimposed onto the surgical plan. For the template-guided group, plastic templates were manufactured to allow an exact fit between template and the joint anatomy. Cylindrical holes within the template guided surgical tools according to the plan. Three months postsurgery, both knees were harvested and computed tomography scans were used to compare the reconstructed versus the native pre-injury joint surfaces. For each repaired defect, macroscopic (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS]) and histological repair (ICRS II) scores were assessed.Three months after repair surgery, both image-guided surgical approaches resulted in significantly better histology scores compared with the conventional approach (improvement by 55%, P < 0.02). Interestingly, there were no significant differences found in cartilage surface reconstruction and macroscopic scores between the image-guided and the conventional surgeries.",0

All English language studies that assessed the outcomes of a surgical technique for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions in football players' knees, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months, were included. The reference list of the most relevant papers was screened. The main outcomes of interest were the clinical, arthroscopy or imaging primary outcomes and the return to sports rate. The methodological and reporting qualities were assessed according to Coleman methodology score.The search provided 485 titles and abstracts. Five studies were eligible for inclusion (mean Coleman score of 37.2 points), comprising a total of 183 football players with a mean age of 25.7 years. A total of 217 articular cartilage and/or osteochondral lesions were reported, where the medial and lateral femoral condyles were the most common sites of lesion. The surgical procedures investigated were mosaicplasty, microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and chondral debridement.No definitive conclusion could be made in respect to the best current surgical technique for articular cartilage and osteochondral lesions. Microfracture and mosaicplasty can provide a faster return to competition and faster clinical and functional results, whereas autologous chondrocyte implantation and/or matrix-induced autologous chondrocytes implantation procedures can enhance longstanding clinical and functional results.Level IV, systematic review of Level III and IV studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465221087391,The Effect of Patellar Surface Morphology on Subchondral Bone Alignment When Matching Patellar Osteochondral Allografts to the Central Ridge of the Patella,"Cartilage transplants in the patellofemoral joint have demonstrated lower success rates than in the femoral condyles. This is likely related to the more complex morphology and biomechanics of the joint. While previous studies have evaluated cartilage surface matching and congruence, little work has been done to study the associated subchondral bone congruency in these grafts.To determine if differences in patellar morphology play a role in the alignment of the donor patellar osteochondral allograft subchondral bone with the native patellar subchondral bone.Controlled laboratory study.A total of 20 (10 Wiberg I and 10 Wiberg II/III) fresh-frozen human patellae were designated as recipients and size-matched to both a Wiberg I and a Wiberg II/III patellar donor. A 16-mm osteochondral allograft transplant to the central ridge of the patella was performed in random order with each matched donor. Transplanted patellae underwent a nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) scan, were digitally reconstructed, and were superimposed on the initial nano-CT scan of the native recipient patella. MATLAB was used to determine the surface height deviation between the native and donor subchondral bone surfaces. DragonFly 3-dimensional imaging software was used to measure subchondral bone step-off heights at the native-donor interface. Differences between matched and unmatched grafts were compared using a 2-way analysis of variance and the Sidak post hoc test.Subchondral bone surface deviation did not differ between Wiberg matched and unmatched allografts. The step-off height was significantly greater in unmatched (1.38 ± 0.49 mm) compared with matched (1.14 ± 0.52 mm) plugs (P = .015). The lateral quadrant step-off differed between matched (0.89 ± 0.43 mm) and unmatched (1.60 ± 0.78 mm) grafts (P = .007).While unmatched Wiberg patellar osteochondral allograft implantation did not result in significantly different subchondral bone surface height deviations, there was a significant difference in the circumferential subchondral bone step-off height in the lateral quadrant. Further investigation using finite element analysis modeling will help determine the role of subchondral bone surface on shear and compression force distributions in these areas.Given that subchondral bone stiffness and morphology play a role in cartilage health, subchondral bone congruency may play a role in graft survival. Understanding how this congruency plays a role in cartilage force distribution will help surgeons improve the long-term success of osteochondral allograft transplants.",0

Compared with articular chondrocytes, chondrocytes derived from the nasal septum have superior and more reproducible capacity to generate hyaline-like cartilage tissues, with the plasticity to adapt to a joint environment. We aimed to assess whether engineered autologous nasal chondrocyte-based cartilage grafts allow safe and functional restoration of knee cartilage defects.In a first-in-human trial, ten patients with symptomatic, post-traumatic, full-thickness cartilage lesions (2-6 cm2) on the femoral condyle or trochlea were treated at University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. Chondrocytes isolated from a 6 mm nasal septum biopsy specimen were expanded and cultured onto collagen membranes to engineer cartilage grafts (30 × 40 × 2 mm). The engineered tissues were implanted into the femoral defects via mini-arthrotomy and assessed up to 24 months after surgery. Primary outcomes were feasibility and safety of the procedure. Secondary outcomes included self-assessed clinical scores and MRI-based estimation of morphological and compositional quality of the repair tissue. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01605201. The study is ongoing, with an approved extension to 25 patients.For every patient, it was feasible to manufacture cartilaginous grafts with nasal chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix rich in glycosaminoglycan and type II collagen. Engineered tissues were stable through handling with forceps and could be secured in the injured joints. No adverse reactions were recorded and self-assessed clinical scores for pain, knee function, and quality of life were improved significantly from before surgery to 24 months after surgery. Radiological assessments indicated variable degrees of defect filling and development of repair tissue approaching the composition of native cartilage.Hyaline-like cartilage tissues, engineered from autologous nasal chondrocytes, can be used clinically for repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. Future studies are warranted to assess efficacy in large controlled trials and to investigate an extension of indications to early degenerative states or to other joints.Deutsche Arthrose-Hilfe.",1

Recently improved approaches and tissue-engineered cell constructs have been developed for growing patient populations. We developed a chondrocyte construct using a collagen gel and sponge scaffold and physicochemical stimuli, implanted with a surgical adhesive. We conducted a proof-of-concept study of these improvements using a cartilage defect model in miniature swine. Design We implanted the autologous chondrocyte constructs into full-thickness chondral defects in the femoral condyle, compared those results with empty and acellular scaffold controls, and compared implantation techniques with adhesive alone and with partial adhesive with suture. Two weeks after the creation of the defects and implantation of the cellular or acellular constructs, we arthroscopically confirmed that the implanted constructs remained at the chondral defects. We evaluated the regenerated tissue macro- and microscopically 6 months after the cell constructs were implanted. The tissues were stained with Safranin-O and evaluated using Sellers’ histology grading system. Results The defects implanted with processed cell constructs and acellular scaffolds were filled with chondrocyte-like round cells and with nearly normal tissue architecture that were significantly greater degree compared to empty defect control. Even with the adhesive alone and with suture alone, the cell construct was composed of the dense cartilaginous matrix that was found in the implantation using both the sutures and the adhesive. Conclusion Implantation of cell constructs promoted regeneration and integration of articular cartilage at chondral defects in swine by 6 months.",0

In the literature, there is lack of evidence about the appropriate treatment in cases of failure of these procedures. A technique of osteochondral autologous transplantation of talar graft was used. It was hypothesized that this is a successful method with good results and low complication rates. Additionally, a technique of anterior ankle approach with temporary removal of a bone block from the distal tibia that gives adequate access to posterior talar dome lesions is demonstrated. Between 2004 and 2007, 46 patients (37 males, 9 females), with OLT for which arthroscopic treatment with curettage and drilling or microfracture had failed, underwent osteochondral transplantation with an osteochondral graft harvested from the ipsilateral talar articular facet. A medial malleolar osteotomy or a distal tibial wedge osteotomy was used to access the talar dome defect. The median follow-up time was 5.5 years (range 52-75 m). Thirty-four lesions (70.8 %) were located in the central talar dome in the coronal plane, while 26 (54.1 %) and 19 (39.5 %) lesions were located in the lateral and medial aspect of talar dome in saggital plane, respectively. The overall improvement between the preoperative and post-operative AOFAS and VAS FA score was 35 points (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001) and 39 points (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001), respectively. Clinical results were considered as good in 43 patients (93.4 %) and fair in three patients (6.5 %). All the transplanted grafts were observed to incorporate fully into the recipient bed. No complications occurred at the site of the malleolus osteotomy or tibial osteotomy and the donor site at the talus. The midterm results suggest that the technique of osteochondral transplantation of autologous talar graft for osteochondral lesions of talus after failure of primary treatment with bone marrow stimulation can be safely and successfully used. It demonstrates excellent post-operative scores including improvement of pain and function. This procedure is combined with removal of a tibial bone block and its subsequent replacement and does not yield complications experienced with other procedures.

These 5 patients are part of a larger pilot study in which 180 patients with International Cartilage Repair Society grade III and IV lesions of the knee joint underwent arthroscopic subchondral drilling followed by postoperative intra-articular injections. Continuous passive motion was used on the operated knee 2 hours per day for 4 weeks. Partial weight bearing was observed for the first 6 to 8 weeks. Autologous PBPCs were harvested 1 week after surgery. One week after surgery, 8 mL of the harvested PBPCs in combination with 2 mL of HA was injected intra-articularly into the operated knee. The remaining PBPCs were divided into vials and cryopreserved. A total of 5 weekly intra-articular injections were given.Second-look arthroscopy confirmed articular cartilage regeneration, and histologic sections showed features of hyaline cartilage.

Design A literature search was performed using the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases for studies in English (1980-2017) using keywords, including [“bone marrow aspirate” and “cartilage”], [“mesenchymal stem cells” and “cartilage”], and [“bone marrow aspirate” and “mesenchymal stem cells” and “orthopedics”]. A total of 1832 articles were reviewed by 2 independent authors and additional literature found through scanning references of cited articles. Results BMAC has demonstrated promising results in the clinical application for repair of chondral defects as an adjuvant procedure or as an independent management technique. A subcomponent of BMAC, bone marrow derived–mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess the ability to differentiate into cells important for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Modulation of paracrine signaling is perhaps the most important function of BM-MSCs in this setting. In an effort to increase the cellular yield, authors have shown the ability to expand BM-MSCs in culture while maintaining phenotype. Conclusions Translational studies have demonstrated good clinical efficacy of BMAC both concomitant with cartilage restoration procedures, at defined time points after surgery, and as isolated injections. Early clinical data suggests BMAC may help stimulate a more robust hyaline cartilage repair tissue response. Numerous questions remain regarding BMAC usage, including cell source, cell expansion, optimal pathology, and injection timing and quantity.",0

The development of a completely arthroscopic ACI procedure in the ankle joint made the technique easier and reduced the morbidity. The purpose of this investigation was to report the clinical results of a series of patients who underwent arthroscopic ACI of the talus at a mean of 7 +/- A 1.2-year follow-up. Forty-six patients (mean age 31.4 +/- A 7.6) affected by osteochondral lesions of the talar dome (OLT) received arthroscopic ACI between 2001 and 2006. Patients were clinically evaluated using AOFAS score pre-operatively and at 12, 36 months and at final follow-up of 87.2 +/- A 14.5 months. The mean pre-operative AOFAS score was 57.2 +/- A 14.3. At the 12-month follow-up, the mean AOFAS score was 86.8 +/- A 13.4 (p = 0.0005); at 36 months after surgery, the mean score was 89.5 +/- A 13.4 (p = 0.0005); whereas at final follow-up of 87.2 +/- A 14.5 months it was 92.0 +/- A 11.2 (p = 0.0005).

We also evaluated the cartilage repair response to six smaller microdrill holes compared with two larger holes. Bilateral knee trochlear cartilage defects were created in n=8 skeletally mature rabbits, drilled with six proximal 0.5 mm and two distal 0.9 mm holes, then covered with in situ-solidified IIa-implants (treated) or with IIa-alone (control). After 6.5 months of repair, cartilage repair tissues were analyzed by histological scoring and histomorphometry for hyaline matrix characteristics and osseous integration. Subchondral repair bone was analyzed by 3D microcomputed tomography and compared to acute defects (n=6) and intact trochlea (n=8). Implant-treated cartilage repair tissues had higher structural integrity through the entire defect (p=0.02), twofold higher percent staining for glycosaminoglycan (p=0.0004), and ~24% more collagen type II staining over the smaller drill holes (p=0.008) compared with controls. Otherwise, hole diameter had no specific effect on cartilage repair. The subchondral bone plate was partially restored in treated and control defects but less dense than intact trochlea, with evidence of incomplete regeneration of the calcified cartilage layer. More residual drill holes (p=0.054) were detected in control versus treated defects, and control defects with more than 40% residual holes presented abnormally thicker trabeculae compared with treated defects. Low osteoclast numbers after 6.5 months repair suggested that bone was no longer remodeling. The subchondral bone plate surrounding the defects exhibited a significant thickening compared with age-matched intact trochlea. These data suggest that debridement and drilling can lead to long-term subchondral bone changes outside the cartilage defect. Compared with drilled controls, chitosan implants solidified with thrombin elicited a more hyaline and structurally integrated osteochondral unit, features needed for long-term durability.",0

However, the efficacy of BMC in combination with tissue engineering is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the addition of BMC to an osteochondral scaffold is safe and can improve the repair of large osteochondral defects when compared to the scaffold alone.The ovine femoral condyle model was used. Bone marrow was aspirated, concentrated, and used intraoperatively with a collagen/hydroxyapatite scaffold to fill the osteochondral defects (n = 6). Tissue regeneration was then assessed versus the scaffold-only group (n = 6). Histological staining of cartilage with alcian blue and safranin-O, changes in chondrogenic gene expression, microCT, peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT), and force-plate gait analyses were performed. Lymph nodes and blood were analyzed for safety.The results six months postoperatively showed that there were no significant differences in bone regrowth and mineral density between BMC-treated animals and controls. A significant upregulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) for types I and II collagens in the BMC group was observed, but there were no differences in the formation of hyaline-like cartilage between the groups. A trend towards reduced sulphated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) breakdown was detected in the BMC group but this was not statistically significant. Functional weightbearing was not affected by the inclusion of BMC.Our results indicated that the addition of BMC to scaffold is safe and has some potentially beneficial effects on osteochondral-tissue regeneration, but not on the functional endpoint of orthopaedic interest.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-001-0259-6,Large osteochondral defects of the femoral condyle: press-fit transplantation of the posterior femoral condyle (MEGA-OATS),"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large osteochondral defects in the weight-bearing zone of the knee remain a challenging therapeutic problem. Surgical options include drilling, microfracturing, and transplantation of osteochondral plugs but are often insufficient for the treatment of large defects of the femoral condyle. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Large osteochondral defects of the femoral condyle (mean defect size 7.2 cm(2) range 3-20) were treated by transplantation of the autologous posterior femoral condyle. Between 1984 and 2000, 29 patients were operated on: in 22 the medial, in 6 the lateral femoral condyle, and in one the trochlear groove was grafted. Thirteen patients underwent simultaneous high tibial valgus osteotomy. In the first series (1984-1999) the graft was temporarily fixed with a screw ( n=12), but from 1999 we used a newly developed press-fit technique ( n=17) avoiding screw fixation of the graft. The operative technique comprising graft harvest, defect preparation, transplantation, and fixation is described. Patients were clinically evaluated using the Lysholm score, and magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous contrast was performed 6 and 12 weeks after surgery (mean follow-up 17.7 months (range 3-46). RESULTS: Pain and swelling were reduced in 26 patients. Three patients of the first series reported persistent problems and were subjectively not satisfied. The mean Lysholm score rose from preoperatively 52 to 77 points after 3 months, 74 after 6, 88 after 12, and 95 after 18. Magnetic resonance imaging showed good graft viability in all cases. We saw one arthrofibrosis after 6 months but noted no problems related to the loss of the missing posterior condyle. CONCLUSION: Large osteochondral defects of the femoral condyle can be treated by transplantation of the autologous posterior femoral condyle. The use of only one osteochondral piece renders better approximation of the femoral cartilage curvature and thus joint congruence than in mosaic plasty. However, whether loss of the posterior condyle has a long-term negative impact on the knee joint remains to be elucidated.",0

Autologous osteochondral mosaic transplantation technique is one of the recently evolved methods to create hyaline or hyaline-like repair tissue in the pathologic area. Clinical evaluation, various imaging techniques, arthroscopy (second look), histological examination of biopsy samples, and measurements of cartilage mechanical properties are used to evaluate the merits of outcomes and quality of the transplanted cartilage. According to our investigations, good to excellent results were achieved in more than 92% of patients treated with femoral condylar implantations, 87% of those treated with tibial resurfacing, 79% of those treated with patellar and/or trochlear mosaicplasties, and 94% of those treated with talar procedures. Long-term donor-site discrepancies, assessed with use of the Bandi Score, showed that patients had 3% morbidity after mosaicplasty. Sixty-nine of 89 patients who were followed up with a second-look arthroscopy showed congruent gliding surfaces, histological evidence of the survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage, and fibrocartilage filling of the donor sites. In a series of 831 consecutive patients, very few complications have been observed. These included 4 deep infections and 36 painful postoperative intra-articular bleedings. On the basis of these results and those of other similar studies, autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty appears to be a promising alternative for the treatment of small- and medium-sized focal chondral and osteochondral defects of the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee and other weight-bearing synovial joints.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2014.11.018,Systematic Review of Autogenous Osteochondral Transplant Outcomes,"The goal of this systematic review was to present the current best evidence for clinical outcomes of osteochondral autograft transplantation to elucidate the efficacy of this procedure.PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched (key terms ""knee,"" ""osteochondral autograft transfer,"" or ""mosaicplasty"") to identify relevant literature between 1950 and 2013 in the English language. This evaluation included studies in pediatric and adult patients with grade 3 or 4 articular cartilage injuries; the studies had a minimum of 25 patients and at least 12 months of follow-up and compared osteochondral autograft transfers/mosiacplasty with another treatment modality. Articles were limited to full-text randomized controlled trials or cohort studies. Main outcomes studied were patient-reported and functional outcome, with secondary outcomes including effect of lesion size, return to sport and sport function, radiographic outcomes, and reoperation rates.There were a total of 9 studies with 607 patients studied in this systematic review. When osteochondral autologous transfer/mosaicplasty (OATM) was compared with microfracture (MF), patients with OATM had better clinical results, with a higher rate of return to sport and maintenance of their sports function from before surgery. Meanwhile, patients who underwent MF trended toward more reoperations, with deterioration around 4 years after surgery. When compared with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), clinical outcome improvement was not conclusive; however, at 10-year follow-up, a greater failure rate was found to be present in the OATM group.Current evidence shows improved clinical outcomes with OATM when compared with preoperative conditions. These patients were able to return to sport as early as 6 months after the procedure. It could be suggested from the data that OATM procedures might be more appropriate for lesions that are smaller than 2 cm(2) with the known risk of failure between 2 and 4 years. Further high-quality prospective studies into the management of these articular cartilage injuries are necessary to provide a better framework within which to target intervention.Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.",0

There have been multiple approaches to treat such lesions, including arthroscopic debridement, microfracture, multiple drilling, osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) that are currently being used in clinical practice. Autologous bone-marrow mesenchymal cell induced chondrogenesis (MCIC) is a single-staged arthroscopic procedure. This method combines a modified microfracture technique with the application of a bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), hyaluronic acid and fibrin gel to treat articular cartilage defects. We reviewed the current literatures and surgical techniques for mesenchymal cell induced chondrogenesis.",0

Our hypothesis was that there would be improvements in postoperative subjective scores and cartilage repair tissue quality.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.A total of 21 patients (12 male and 9 female) were available for 2-year follow-up after third-generation ACI using the Igor scaffold. All were clinically assessed using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner Activity Scale, Brittberg score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, Noyes Sports Activity Rating Scale, and visual analog scale for pain. For morphological evaluation, the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) and MOCART 2.0 scores were calculated using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Results were compared between baseline and 24 months postoperatively.After 2 years, the clinical and radiological scores showed good to excellent results in the majority of patients. On the IKDC, 10 patients were graded as excellent, 4 as good, 5 as fair, and 2 as severe; on the KOOS, 7 patients were graded as excellent, 8 as good, 4 as fair, and 2 as severe. From baseline to latest follow-up, visual analog scale pain scores decreased from 5.6 ± 3.2 (mean ± SD) to 1.5 ± 2; KOOS results increased from 51 ± 20.7 to 75.2 ± 15.4; and the Tegner score improved from 2.2 ± 1.8 to 4.3 ± 1.3. The MOCART and MOCART 2.0 scores were comparable at 2-year follow-up, with mean values of 74 ± 10 and 78 ± 13, respectively. Satisfactory filling and integration were found in 90.5%. Overall, 16 of 21 patients (76.1%) were satisfied with the surgery and would undergo the procedure again.Third-generation ACI using the Igor scaffold showed improvements in clinical and radiological results that were comparable with other scaffolds for patients with large traumatic or degenerative cartilage defects. Patients reported a decrease in pain and an increase in activity, with the majority reporting good results.",0

OC tissue from the sheep femur were obtained and decellularized. The decellularized ECM (dECM) was combined with either platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), amniotic membrane extract (AME), or rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (rBMSCs). The hybrid dECM-biological products were then utilized for the treatment of rabbit OC critical size defects. The regenerative potential of different groups was compared using; MRI, macroscopic assessment, histopathology, and histomorphometry. All characterizations analysis verified successful decellularization. Three months post-surgery, macroscopic findings indicated that dECM was better compared to controls. Also, dECM in combination with AME, PRF, and rBMSCs showed enhanced OC regeneration compared to only dECM (AME: +100%, PRF: +61%, rBMSCs: +28%). In particular, the dECM+AME group results in the best integration of new cartilage into surrounding cartilage tissue. The histomorphometric evaluations demonstrated enhancement in new cartilage formation and bone tissue (86.5 ± 5.9% and 90 ± 7.7%, respectively) for the dECM+AME group compared to other groups. Furthermore, histological results for the dECM+AME elucidated a mature hyaline cartilage tissue that covered the new and symmetrically formed subchondral bone, exhibiting a significantly higher regenerative effect compared to all other treated groups. This finding was also confirmed with MRI images. The current study revealed that in addition to the benefits of dECM alone, its combination with AME indicated to have a superior regenerative effect on OC regeneration. Overall, dECM+AME may be considered a suitable construct for treating knee OC injuries.",0

Femoral medial closing wedge osteotomy for the correction of valgus malalignment to unload the cartilage in the lateral compartment and/or correction of symptomatic torsional malalignment. Indications. Lateral unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee with genu valgum in young patients. Symptomatic torsional malalignement of \textbackslashtextgreater 30 degrees and \textbackslashtextless 0 degrees. Contraindications. Grade 3 and 4 cartilage damage in the medial compartment. Heavy smoking. Medial meniscectomy. Extreme obesity. Inadequate soft tissue conditions. Surgical technique. The operation begins with arthroscopy of the knee joint. In case of grade 4 lateral cartilage damage, a microfracture is performed. The distal femur is exposed via an anteromedial longitudinal incision starting 10 cm above the patella and ending in the upper third of the patella. The medial femoral cortex is exposed using Hohmann retractors and an oblique closing wedge osteotomy is performed with an oscillating saw. In case of valgus correction, the lateral cortex is left intact. In case of correction of torsional malalignment, the osteotomy plane is horizontal and the lateral cortex is cut. The wedge height is determined preoperatively based on full leg x-rays. The leg axis is controlled intraoperatively with a long metal rod and the use of an image intensifier. The osteotomy is manually closed and stabilized with a locking plate. Postoperative management. The patient is mobilized under load with 20 kg body weight for the first 6 postoperative weeks. Full range of motion is permitted. Results. We treated 23 patients with lateral cartilage damage (grades 3 and 4) and genu valgum with medial closing osteotomy of the distal femur (6 men and 17 women). After 3.5-years follow-up, the KOOS increased from 48.4 points to 84.9 points. In one case, there was an early loss of correction, with subsequent revision with bone grafting and lateral osteosynthesis. No peri-or postoperative complications such as infection, thrombosis, and embolism occurred [ 24]. In 5 cases a torsional osteotomy was performed. The torsional osteotomy was performed 4 times due to chronic patellofemoral instability, and once due to a medial tibiofemoral instability. Healing complications were not observed in this population. Recurrent instability was not observed.",0

Recently, osteochondral autografting has gained popularity for use in small cartilage injuries. The aims of this study were to characterize the SONK lesion histopathologically and to report on preliminary clinical results of autogenous osteochondral grafting for SONK. Six patients with SONK of the medial femoral condyle underwent osteochondral autografting. Average age was 54.2 years (range, 50-57 years). Using Koshino's classification, three patients' lesions were classified as stage III and three as stage IV. Classical histological investigation of the lesions was performed in all cases. All the patients achieved favorable pain relief after osteochondral autografts. The mean duration of follow-up was 27.7 months (range, 23-45 months). An increase in the average Lysholm score was found, ranging from 54.7 preoperatively to 92.3 postoperatively. Histological investigation of the lesions revealed articular bone plate fracture with enchondral ossification, reactive cartilage tissue formation, and proliferation of fibrous tissue. An area of osteonecrosis was observed in detached or fragmented osteochondral lesions. Osteochondral autografting was performed on six patients for the SONK and the short-term clinical results were favorable. Histological results give support to subchondral fracture as the etiological mechanism underlying SONK.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-020-02155-6,Pure platelet-rich plasma facilitates the repair of damaged cartilage and synovium in a rabbit hemorrhagic arthritis knee model,"Abstract Objective Hemorrhagic arthritis (HA) is a common disease of the musculoskeletal system caused by hemorrhage in the joints, leading to damages in the synovium and cartilage. Pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) has been recently demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and regenerative potential attributed to the various cytokines and growth factors that it contains. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of P-PRP for the treatment of patients with mild and severe HA. Methods Autologous blood was withdrawn from the New Zealand rabbits and injected into their left and right knees to establish the HA models. The injection was performed once a week and repeated for 8 weeks to establish the mild HA models and for 16 weeks to establish the severe HA models. One hundred microliters of P-PRP was injected into the left HA knees, and the same volume of sterile 0.9% saline was injected into the corresponding right knees. MRI examination, H&amp;E staining, and toluidine blue staining were respectively performed to evaluate the histological difference of synovium and cartilage between the P-PRP treated and untreated mild and severe groups. Normal knees were set as the control group. Results Pathological changes including tissue color, joint effusion, and synovium inflammation in the mild treated group were less severe compared to the other three experimental groups based on gross observation. The difference of joint cavity diameter between the mild treated and untreated groups was 2.67 ± 0.75 mm (95%CI, 1.20–4.14 mm), which was significantly larger than that between the severe treated and untreated groups (1.50 mm ± 0.48, 95%CI, 0.56–2.44 mm) (mean difference in joint cavity, 1.17 ± 0.32 mm; 95%CI, 0.49–1.85 mm; P &lt; 0.01). MRI examination showed the synovitis and bone marrow edema were less severe in the treated groups compared to the corresponding untreated groups. H&amp;E staining of the synovium suggested that the inflammation was much less and the cell number was much smaller in the treated than in the untreated HA knees in regard to both the mild and severe groups. The mean difference of cell number between the mild treated and untreated groups was 307.40 ± 14.23 (95%CI, 241.54–343.26; P &lt; 0.001), which was 699.20 ± 82.80 (95%CI, 508.26–890.14; P &lt; 0.001) between the severe treated and untreated groups. H&amp;E staining and toluidine blue staining of the cartilage exhibited an obvious amelioration of inflammation and cartilage matrix loss after being treated with P-PRP for both groups, especially the mild group. Conclusions P-PRP was effective for the treatment of HA by inhibiting the development of synovitis and cartilage matrix loss in the affected joints, which was particularly obvious in the early-stage HA. This study supports the view that there is a great potential of P-PRP to be considered and used as a non-operative treatment for hemorrhagic arthritis at its early stage.",0

Is It a Kind of Stem Cell Therapy?,"The role of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) is still inconclusive for restoration of chondral defects in lesions of the knee. More investigation is needed; thus, clinical application of BMAC for chondral defects should be considered cautiously. Correct nomenclature of the entity of cells used in various stem cell therapies for the treatment of cartilage lesions is critical to properly assess the efficacy and safety of various stem cell therapies. Constant effort is needed to prove the therapeutic potential of various novel therapeutic options such as BMAC or stem cell therapy under correct terminology for cartilage restoration before routine clinical application.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-007-0532-3,The fate of osteochondral grafts after autologous osteochondral transplantation: a one-year follow-up study in a minipig model,"Introduction Because articular cartilage shows little intrinsic capacity of spontaneous regeneration, a variety of treatment options are currently at use to repair cartilage damage. One of these is the autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT). The aim of the present work was to study the histological changes during the progress of 1 year after AOT in the knee joint. Materials and methods Twelve Minipigs underwent an AOT on the medial femoral condyles of both knees using cooled diamond studded trephines with a diameter of the grafts of 4.6 mm. Three animals were sacrificed at each 2, 8, 26 and 52 weeks after the operation. The condyles were analyzed histologically and immunohistologically for collagen types I and II. Results A successful bony incorporation was observed in all specimens. The transplant demonstrated an increasingly stable integration of the chondral matrix into the cartilage of the surrounding femoral condyle. At 52 weeks after the operations 5 of 6 condyles showed a chondral integration at least at one side of the graft. Immunohistologically all specimens showed physiological staining characteristics Lip to 52 weeks after operation. The quality of the chondral part of the graft showed a wide range of variations, ranging from vital tissue resembling native cartilage after 52 weeks, to severe degenerative signs beginning 2 weeks after operation and ending at 52 weeks with deep fissures fragmenting the cartilage and the complete loss of vital cells. Conclusion The press-fit technique allows a stable bony incorporation. A chondral integration of the graft seems to occur, provided that a close contact between the interfaces can be achieved. Present results demonstrate a vital cartilagenous transplant for up to 52 weeks. However, some specimens showed in part severe degenerative signs. A possible explanation is an insufficient cooling of the trephines in relation to the small diameter of the grafts used in the minipig model. The collagen network seems not to be affected for up to 52 weeks.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-007-0360-5,"Biochemical, biomechanical and histological properties of osteoarthritic porcine knee cartilage: implications for osteochondral transplantation","Introduction Cartilage lesions of the knee joint are frequently observed during arthroscopy and when surgical intervention is required, osteochondral autograft procedures are an established method of treatment. Frequently lesions are located on the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and typical donor locations for osteochondral grafts include the medial and lateral patellar groove. This technique provides good results, even when the quality of cartilage transplanted from an osteoarthritic joint is doubtful. This study characterizes biological, biomechanical and histological properties of cartilage explants from the patellar groove harvested from osteoarthritic joints. Materials and methods Cylindrical cartilage explants were harvested from the arthritic areas of the MFC as well as normal appearing regions of the medial and lateral patellar groove from porcine joints revealing various grades of osteoarthritis. Matrix synthesis rates were determined, and explants were investigated by mechanical testing and histology. Results Articular cartilage obtained from the typical donor areas of the medial and lateral patellar groove provided constant enhanced material properties, matrix synthesis rates and histological appearance compared to samples from the arthritic lesions of the MFC, even in joints with end-stage osteoarthritis of the MFC. No significant difference was found between patellar groove cartilage samples harvested from joints with different stages of osteoarthritis. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that healthy appearing cartilage from the patellar groove does not undergo significant alterations in material properties due to the arthritic milieu present in osteoarthritic joints. Accordingly these locations provide a source of functional tissue for transplant procedures even in joints with end-stage osteoarthritis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-019-05729-3,Implantation of mesenchymal stem cells in combination with allogenic cartilage improves cartilage regeneration and clinical outcomes in patients with concomitant high tibial osteotomy,"Purpose This study aimed to compare the clinical, radiological, and second-look arthroscopic outcomes of implanting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) alone and together with allogenic cartilage in patients treated with concomitant high tibial oteotomy (HTO) for varus knee osteoarthritis. Methods Eighty patients treated with cartilage repair procedures and concomitant HTO were prospectively randomized into two groups: MSC implantation (MSC group), and MSC implantation with allogenic cartilage (MSC-AC group). Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Lysholm Score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at preoperative and every follow-up visit. Radiological outcomes were evaluated by measuring the femorotibial angle and posterior tibial slope. During second-look arthroscopy, cartilage regeneration was evaluated according to the Kanamiya grade. Results Clinical outcomes at the second-look arthroscopy (mean 12.5 months [MSC group] and 12.4 months [MSC-AC group]) improved significantly in both groups (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001 for all). Clinical outcomes from the second-look arthroscopy to the final follow-up (mean 27.3 months [MSC group] and 27.8 months [MSC-AC group]) improved further only in the MSC-AC group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05 for all). Overall, the Kanamiya grades, which were significantly correlated with clinical outcomes, were significantly higher in the MSC-AC group than in the MSC group. Radiological outcomes at final follow-up revealed improved knee joint alignments relative to preoperative conditions but without significant correlation between clinical outcomes and Kanamiya grade in either group (n.s. for all). Conclusion Implantation of MSCs with allogenic cartilage is superior to implantation of MSCs alone in cartilage regeneration accompanied with better clinical outcomes.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603511435271,Arthroscopic Delivery of Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implant,"To identify consensus recommendations for the arthroscopic delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant.An invited panel was assembled on November 20 and 21, 2009 as an international advisory board in Zurich, Switzerland, to discuss and identify best practices for the arthroscopic delivery of matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation.Arthroscopic matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation is suitable for patients 18 to 55 years of age who have symptomatic, contained chondral lesions of the knee with normal or corrected alignment and stability. This technical note describes consensus recommendations of the international advisory board for the technique of arthroscopic delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant.Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation can be further improved by arthroscopic delivery that does not require special instrumentation. In principle, arthroscopic versus open procedures of delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant are less invasive and may potentially result in less postoperative pain, less surgical site morbidity, and faster surgical recovery. Long-term studies are needed to confirm these assumptions as well as the efficacy and safety of this arthroscopic approach.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/term.1872,Utilizing tissue-engineered cartilage or BMNC-PLGA composites to fill empty spaces during autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty in porcine knees,"The potential empty spaces between cylindrical plugs remaining after autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty rely on fibrous repair, which may constrain the quality and integrity of the repair. Thus, the empty spaces should be repaired, and how to fill the empty spaces is still a problem. In the present study, a standardized full-thickness defect (diameter, 6 mm) was created in the weight-bearing area of each medial femoral condyle in both knees of 18 miniature pigs. The 36 knees were randomly assigned to four groups with nine in each group. The defects were initially repaired by autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty. Simultaneously, any empty spaces between the multiple plugs were filled with cell-free poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds (the scaffold group), tissue-engineered cartilage (the TE group) or bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMNC)-PLGA composites (the composite group). The empty spaces were left untreated as control (the control group). Six months after surgery, the repair results were assessed via macroscopic observation, histological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging, biomechanical assessment and glycosaminoglycan content. The results demonstrated that mosaicplasty combined with the treatment of the empty spaces could improve cartilage regeneration. The filling of empty spaces by tissue-engineered cartilage produced the best result in all the four groups. Meanwhile, utilizing BMNC-PLGA composites achieved a similar repair result. Considering the cost-effective, time-saving and convenient performance, the BMNC-PLGA composite could be an alternative option to fill the empty spaces combined with mosaicplasty.

Treatments were compared if reported in more than one study using network meta-analysis to boost the number of included studies per comparison.We studied 21 articles that included 891 patients. Traumatic lesion was the most common cause in the included patients. There were significantly higher failure rates in the microfracture (MF) group compared to autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) group at 10-year follow-up. Moreover, osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) showed significantly more excellent or good results at > 3-year follow-up compared to MF, whereas MF showed significantly more poor results versus ACI and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI). Furthermore, OAT showed significantly more poor results than MACI at 1-year follow-up. Similarly, patients who underwent OAT had higher return-to-activity rates than those with MF. It is noteworthy that the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score was higher in patients who underwent characterized chondrocyte implantation or MACI compared to MF. Finally, there were no significant differences among the various interventions regarding reintervention, biopsy types or adverse events. According to the P scores for interventions ranking, there was a disagreement concerning the best intervention; however, MF was always ranked as the last.Cartilage repair techniques, rather than MF, provide higher quality repair of tissue and have lower failure and higher return-to-activity rates. Moreover, OAT had significantly more excellent or good results compared to MF, whereas MF had significantly more poor results than ACI and MACI. Future studies need to have longer follow-up periods and more representative populations to investigate the efficacy and safety of these interventions.Level I: meta-analysis of Level I studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-009-0942-6,Treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus: a systematic review,"The aim of this study was to summarize all eligible studies to compare the effectiveness of treatment strategies for osteochondral defects (OCD) of the talus. Electronic databases from January 1966 to December 2006 were systematically screened. The proportion of the patient population treated successfully was noted, and percentages were calculated. For each treatment strategy, study size weighted success rates were calculated. Fifty-two studies described the results of 65 treatment groups of treatment strategies for OCD of the talus. One randomized clinical trial was identified. Seven studies described the results of non-operative treatment, 4 of excision, 13 of excision and curettage, 18 of excision, curettage and bone marrow stimulation (BMS), 4 of an autogenous bone graft, 2 of transmalleolar drilling (TMD), 9 of osteochondral transplantation (OATS), 4 of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), 3 of retrograde drilling and 1 of fixation. OATS, BMS and ACI scored success rates of 87, 85 and 76%, respectively. Retrograde drilling and fixation scored 88 and 89%, respectively. Together with the newer techniques OATS and ACI, BMS was identified as an effective treatment strategy for OCD of the talus. Because of the relatively high cost of ACI and the knee morbidity seen in OATS, we conclude that BMS is the treatment of choice for primary osteochondral talar lesions. However, due to great diversity in the articles and variability in treatment results, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Further sufficiently powered, randomized clinical trials with uniform methodology and validated outcome measures should be initiated to compare the outcome of surgical strategies for OCD of the talus.",0
https://doi.org/10.3727/000000005783982666,Time Course Evaluation of Reparative Cartilage with MR Imaging after Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the qualitative change in reparative cartilage after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Ten knees of 10 patients were studied. The signal intensities of reparative and normal cartilage were evaluated by fat-suppressed three-dimensional spoiled-gradient recalled (FS 3D-SPGR) MR imaging. The signal intensity (SI) index (signal intensity of reparative cartilage divided by that of normal cartilage) was defined and the change in SI index was investigated. Histological and biochemical evaluation was done at the second look arthroscopy. The SI index was at its lowest level immediately after ACI and increased with time to 9 months thereafter. After 9-12 months, the SI index settled to almost level and was maintained at that value for at least 2-3 years postoperatively. The average of the SI indexes after 12 months to the last examination was 74.2 +/- 4.6 (range 64.2-82.8), which means signal intensity of reparative cartilage was maintained at a value lower than that of normal cartilage. The total ICRS score was 11.6 +/- 2.3 points (mean +/- SD). The GAG concentration was 107.9 +/- 17.0 microg/mg (mean +/- SD) in normal cartilage and 65.9 +/- 9.4 microg/mg in reparative cartilage. The quality of reparative cartilage as hyaline cartilage was inferior to that of normal cartilage. In the present study, the time course change in the SI index indicates that the major maturation process of implanted chondrocytes neared completion in 9-12 months. Minor changes, such as matrix remodeling with reorganization of the collagen fibers in reparative cartilage, may continue, but an almost identical condition seemed to be maintained during the first 2-3 years of follow-up. SI index does not always reflect all properties of reparative cartilage but may be a useful parameter for noninvasive evaluation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112945,Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with COX-2 silence and TGF-β3 overexpression in rabbits with antigen-induced arthritis,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), especially genetically modified MSCs, have become a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through modulating immune responses. However, most MSCs used in the treatment of RA are modified based on a single gene. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of human BMSCs (hBMSCs) with COX-2 silence and TGF-β3 overexpression in the treatment of RA in a rabbit model.hBMSCs were cotransfected with shCOX-2 and TGF-β3 through lentiviral vector delivery. After SPIO-Molday ION Rhodamine-B™ (MIRB) labeling, lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs, lenti-shCOX2 hBMSCs, lenti-TGF-β3 hBMSCs, hBMSCs without genetic modification, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the knee joint of rabbits with antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). The diameter of the knee joint and soft-tissue swelling score (STS) were recorded, and the levels of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were evaluated by ELISA. Clinical 3.0T MR imaging (MRI) was used to track the distribution and dynamic migration of hBMSCs in the joint. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assays were conducted to localize labeled hBMSCs and assess the alteration of synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cartilage damage.COX-2 silencing and TGF-β3 overexpression in hBMSCs were confirmed through real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Reduced joint diameter, soft-tissue swelling (STS) score, and PGE2, IL-1β, and TNF-α expression were detected 4 weeks after injection of MIRB-labeled lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs into the joint in rabbits with AIA. Eight weeks after hBMSC injection, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, improved hyperplasia of the synovial lining, recovered cartilage damage, and increased matrix staining were observed in joints injected with lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs and lenti-shCOX2 hBMSCs. Slight synovial hyperplasia, no surface fibrillation, and strong positive expression of collagen II staining in chondrocytes and cartilage matrix were detected in the joints 12 weeks after injection of lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs. In addition, hBMSCs were detected by MRI imaging throughout the process of hBMSC treatment.Intra-articular injection of hBMSCs with COX-2 silence and TGFβ3 overexpression not only significantly inhibited joint inflammation and synovium hyperplasia, but also protected articular cartilage at the early stage. In addition, intra-articular injection of hBMSCs with COX-2 silence and TGFβ3 overexpression promoted chondrocyte and matrix proliferation. This study provides an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RA using genetically modified hBMSCs.",0

The purpose of this study was to find a simple, effective 1-step articular cartilage repair method. Because stem cell niches produce a microenvironment for stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation, we integrated in situ bone marrow stem cells with an implanted poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLLGA) scaffold. Marrow stem cells grew and proliferated on cell-free PLLGA scaffolds, which were evaluated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Twenty-seven rabbits (54 knees) with large cylinder femoral trochlear cartilage defects were created and repaired with microfracture and cell-free PLLGA scaffold implantation (group 1), microfracture (group 2), or cell-free PLLGA scaffold implantation (group 3).Outcomes were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, International Cartilage Repair Society scores, histology, and immunohistochemistry. The repair effects were better in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. In group 1, hyaline-like cartilage formed at week 24. Magnetic resonance imaging showed homogeneous signals as the adjacent normal cartilage. Collagen type II and toluidine blue were stained positively as normal cartilage tissue, and the color and thickness of regenerated tissue were similar to surrounding normal tissue. The combination of microfracture and cell-free PLLGA scaffold implantation used endogenous marrow stem cells in situ and promoted hyaline-like cartilage regeneration rapidly and effectively.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/jsa.0000000000000071,BioCartilage,"Articular cartilage damage affects almost everyone at some point. Our ability to heal these defects has been very limited. Microfracture, which is one of the most common attempted surgeries for chondral lesions, has resulted in poor long-term outcomes. Other solutions like allograft osteochondral autograft transfer system, DeNovo, or autologous chondrocyte implantation are more extensive, difficult, expensive surgeries, and are better served for larger lesions. Smaller lesions have shown good short-term outcomes with microfracture but result in creation of fibrocartilage, which is weaker and softer and does not hold up long term. A simple, inexpensive, longer-term solution is needed. BioCartilage is dehydrated, micronized allogeneic cartilage that can be implanted with platelet-rich plasma into these smaller cartilage defects. BioCartilage acts as scaffold, allowing for the creation of hyaline-like cartilage.",0

One-way analysis of variance and Tukey HSD post hoc tests were used to evaluate group differences (P < .05).The vertical FasT-Fix device group (3.2 +/- 0.49 mm) had less displacement after cyclic testing than either the horizontal FasT-Fix (4.4 +/- 0.73 mm, P = .003) or the RapidLoc (4.6 +/- 0.22 mm, P = .002) device groups. The vertical FasT-Fix device group had greater stiffness during cyclic testing (14.4 +/- 2.1 N/mm) than the horizontal FasT-Fix (10.4 +/- 1.6 N/mm, P = .0001) or the RapidLoc (9.7 +/- 0.44 N/mm, P = .0001) device groups. During load to failure testing, the vertical FasT-Fix group (125.3 +/- 39 N) had 28% greater strength than the horizontal FasT-Fix device group (89.7 +/- 14 N, P = .02) and 30% greater strength than the RapidLoc device group (87.1 +/- 13 N, P = .028), whereas displacement and stiffness did not show statistically significant group differences.The vertical FasT-Fix group had superior biomechanical characteristics for meniscal fixation during cyclic and load to failure testing compared with horizontal FasT-Fix or RapidLoc devices.Although the RapidLoc devices provided fixation characteristics comparable to horizontally implanted FasT-Fix devices, vertically implanted FasT-Fix devices may provide superior all-inside fixation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/ar2638,Treatment of focal degenerative cartilage defects with polymer-based autologous chondrocyte grafts: four-year clinical results,"Second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation with scaffolds stabilizing the grafts is a clinically effective procedure for cartilage repair. In this ongoing prospective observational case report study, we evaluated the effectiveness of BioSeed-C, a cell-based cartilage graft based on autologous chondrocytes embedded in fibrin and a stable resorbable polymer scaffold, for the treatment of clinical symptomatic focal degenerative defects of the knee.Clinical outcome after 4-year clinical follow-up was assessed in 19 patients with preoperatively radiologically confirmed osteoarthritis and a Kellgren-Lawrence score of 2 or more. Clinical scoring was performed before implantation of the graft and 6, 12, and 48 months after implantation using the Lysholm score, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score. Cartilage regeneration and articular resurfacing were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 4 years after implantation of the autologous cartilage graft.Significant improvement (P < 0.05) of the Lysholm and ICRS scores was observed as early as 6 months after implantation of BioSeed-C and remained stable during follow-up. The IKDC score showed significant improvement compared with the preoperative situation at 12 and 48 months (P < 0.05). The KOOS showed significant improvement in the subclasses pain, activities of daily living, and knee-related quality of life 6 months as well as 1 and 4 years after implantation of BioSeed-C in osteoarthritic defects (P < 0.05). MRI analysis showed moderate to complete defect filling with a normal to incidentally hyperintense signal in 16 out of 19 patients treated with BioSeed-C. Two patients without improvement in the clinical and MRI scores received a total knee endoprosthesis after 4 years.The results show that the good clinical outcome achieved 1 year after implantation of BioSeed-C remains stable over the course of a period of 4 years and suggest that implanting BioSeed-C is a promising treatment option for the repair of focal degenerative defects of the knee.",0

Among these, an osteochondral scaffold made of type I collagen and hydroxyapatite has been investigated with promising results up to medium-term follow-up. However, the clinical and imaging results over time still need to be documented. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical outcome and tissue maturation at long-term follow-up after the implantation of the osteochondral scaffold. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 24 patients (7 women, 17 men; age, 36 ± 9.5 years) underwent surgical implantation of the osteochondral scaffold and were prospectively evaluated before surgery, at 2-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up. The mean defect size was 2.9 ± 1.4 cm 2 . Patients were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores, and the activity level was documented with the Tegner score. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation involved the use of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue score combined with 5 more variables focused on the bone layer. Results: A statistically significant improvement of all clinical scores was documented from the baseline to the final evaluation. The IKDC subjective score improved from the preoperative level to 2 years (41 ± 13.2 and 77.1 ± 14.6, respectively) ( P &lt; .0005), with stable results up to 10 years (77.4 ± 19.4). The IKDC objective score changed from 52% of normal and nearly normal knees before the treatment to 84% at 10 years ( P &lt; .0005). Tegner sports activity at the final evaluation (3.8 ± 1.7) was higher compared with the preoperative level (1.6 ± 1.1; P &lt; .05), but it remained significantly lower compared with the preinjury level (5.5 ± 2.6; P &lt; .05). Treatment failed in 1 patient. Persisting graft alterations were observed on MRI scans, although without correlating with the clinical outcome. Conclusion: The regenerative potential of this scaffold is limited, as demonstrated by the signal alterations persisting over time on MRI scans. On the other hand, the clinical improvement was significant and stable over time both in terms of subjective and objective outcomes, including activity level, with overall good results.",0

A Systematic Review,"Objective To perform a systematic review of clinical outcomes following microfracture augmented with biological adjuvants (MFX+) compared with microfracture (MFX) alone. Design The MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched for clinical studies on MFX+ for chondral defects of the knee. Study characteristics and clinical outcome score data were collected. Subjective synthesis was performed using data from randomized controlled studies to determine effect size of MFX+ procedures performed with either injectable or scaffold-based augmentation compared with MFX alone. Results A total of 18 articles reporting on 625 patients (491 MFX+, 134 MFX) were identified. Six studies were level II evidence and 1 study was level I evidence. Mean patient age range was 26 to 51 years, and mean follow-up ranged from 2 to 5 years. All studies demonstrated significant improvement in reported clinical outcome scores at follow-up after MFX+ therapy, and 87% of patients reported satisfaction with treatment. The most commonly reported treatment complication was postoperative stiffness (3.9% of patients). Subjective synthesis on randomized controlled trials demonstrated that 2/2 injectable MFX+ interventions had significantly greater improvements in International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC; P = 0.004) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS; P = 0.012) scores compared with MFX alone, while 2/2 trials on scaffolding MFX+ adjuvants showed comparable postoperative improvements. Conclusions MFX+ biological adjuvants are safe supplements to marrow stimulation for treating cartilage defects in the adult knee. Early literature is heterogenous and extremely limited in quality. Individual trials report both equivalent and superior clinical outcomes compared with MFX alone, making definitive conclusions on the efficacy of MFX+ difficult without higher quality evidence.",0
https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2015.2944,"Targeted transplantation of iron oxide-labeled, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in promoting meniscus regeneration following a rabbit massive meniscal defect","Repair of a massive meniscal defect remains a challenge in the clinic. However, targeted magnetic cell delivery, an emerging technique, may be useful in its treatment. The present study aimed to determine the effect of targeted intra-articular injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-labeled adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in a rabbit model of a massive meniscal defect. ASCs may be directly labeled and almost 100% of the ASCs were labeled with SPIO after 24 h; these SPIO-labeled ASCs may be orientated by magnet. The centrifuged SPIO-labeled ASCs precipitations may be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The anterior half of the medial meniscus of 18 New Zealand Rabbits was excised. After 7 days, the rabbits were randomized to injections of 2×106 SPIO-labeled ASCs, 2×106 unlabeled ASCs or saline. Permanent magnets were fixed to the outside of the operated joints for one day, and after 6 and 12 weeks, the knee joints were examined using MRI, gross and histological observation, and Prussian blue staining. Marked hypointense artifacts caused by SPIO-positive cells in the meniscus were detected using MRI. Histological observation revealed that the anterior portion of the meniscus was similar to the native tissue, demonstrating typical fibrochondrocytes surrounded by richer extracellular matrix in the SPIO-ASCs group. Collagen-rich matrix bridging the interface and the neo-meniscus integrated well with its host meniscus. Furthermore, degenerative changes occurred in all groups, but intra-articular injection of SPIO-ASCs or ASCs alleviated these degenerative changes. Prussian blue staining indicated that the implanted ASCs were directly associated with the regenerated tissue. Overall, targeted intra-articular delivery of SPIO-ASCs promoted meniscal regeneration whilst providing protective effects from osteoarthritic damage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10561-013-9399-4,Opiates do not violate the viability and proliferative activity of human articular chondrocytes,"Articular cartilage injuries present a challenge for the clinician. Autologous chondrocyte implantation embedded in scaffolds are used to treat cartilage defects with favorable outcomes. Autologous serum is often used as a medium for chondrocyte cell culture during the proliferation phase of the process of such products. A previous report showed that opiate analgesics (fentanyl, alfentanil and diamorphine) in the sera have a significant inhibitory effect on chondrocyte proliferation. In order to determine if opiates in serum inhibit chondrocyte proliferation, twenty two patients who underwent knee arthroscopy and were anesthetized with either fentanyl or remifentanil were studied. Blood was drawn before and during opiate administration and up to 2 h after its discontinuation. The sera were used as medium for in vitro proliferation of both cryopreserved and freshly isolated chondrocytes, and the number and viability of cells were measured. There was no difference in the yield or cell viability between the serum samples of patients anesthetized with fentanyl when either fresh or cryopreserved human articular chondrocytes (hACs) were used. Some non-significant reduction in the yield of cells was observed in the serum samples of patients anesthetized with remifentanil when fresh hAC were used. We conclude that Fentanyl in human autologous serum does not inhibit in vitro hAC proliferation. Remifentanil may show minimal inhibitory effect on in vitro fresh hAC proliferation.",0

However, little is known about what variables most contribute to postoperative clinical and graft outcomes as well as overall patient satisfaction with the surgery. Purpose: To estimate the improvement in clinical and radiological outcomes and investigate the independent contribution of pertinent preoperative and postoperative patient, chondral defect, injury/surgery history, and rehabilitation factors to clinical and radiological outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction, 5 years after MACI. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study was undertaken in 104 patients of an eligible 115 patients who were recruited with complete clinical and radiological follow-up at 5 years after MACI to the femoral or tibial condyles. After a review of the literature, a range of preoperative and postoperative variables that had demonstrated an association with postoperative clinical and graft outcomes was selected for investigation. These included age, sex, and body mass index; preoperative 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) mental component score (MCS) and physical component score (PCS); chondral defect size and location; duration of symptoms and prior surgeries; and postoperative time to full weightbearing gait. The sport and recreation (sport/rec) and knee-related quality of life (QOL) subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used as the patient-reported clinical evaluation tools at 5 years, while high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate graft assessment. An MRI composite score was calculated based on the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue score. A patient satisfaction questionnaire was completed by all patients at 5 years. Regression analysis was used to investigate the contribution of these pertinent variables to 5-year postoperative clinical, radiological, and patient satisfaction outcomes. Results: Preoperative MCS and PCS and duration of symptoms contributed significantly to the KOOS sport/rec score at 5 years, while no variables, apart from the baseline KOOS QOL score, contributed significantly to the KOOS QOL score at 5 years. Preoperative MCS, duration of symptoms, and graft size were statistically significant predictors of the MRI score at 5 years after surgery. An 8-week postoperative return to full weightbearing (vs 12 weeks) was the only variable significantly associated with an improved level of patient satisfaction at 5 years. Conclusion: This study outlined factors such as preoperative SF-36 scores, duration of knee symptoms, graft size, and postoperative course of weightbearing rehabilitation as pertinent variables involved in 5-year clinical and radiological outcomes and overall satisfaction. This information may allow orthopaedic surgeons to better screen their patients as good candidates for MACI, while allowing treating therapists to better individualize their preoperative preparatory and postoperative rehabilitation regimens for a best possible outcome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603510380902,Radiological Assessment of Accelerated versus Traditional Approaches to Postoperative Rehabilitation following Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"To assess the safety and efficacy of accelerated compared with traditional postoperative weightbearing (WB) rehabilitation following matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) of the knee, using MRI.A randomized controlled study design was used to assess MRI-based outcomes of MACI grafts in 70 patients (45 men, 25 women) who underwent MACI to the medial or lateral femoral condyle, in combination with either traditional or accelerated approaches to postoperative WB rehabilitation. High-resolution MRI was undertaken and assessed 8 previously defined pertinent parameters of graft repair, as well as a combined MRI composite score at 3, 12, and 24 months postsurgery. The association between clinical and MRI-based outcomes, patient demographics, chondral defect parameters, and injury/surgery history was investigated.Both groups significantly improved (P < 0.05) in the MRI composite score and pertinent descriptors of graft repair throughout the postoperative period until 24 months postsurgery. There were no differences (P > 0.05) observed between the 2 groups. Patient age, body mass index, chondral defect size, and duration of preoperative symptoms were significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with several MRI-based outcomes at 24 months, whereas there were no significant pertinent correlations (P > 0.05) observed between clinical and MRI-based outcomes.The accelerated WB approach was not detrimental to graft development at any stage throughout the postoperative assessment timeline from baseline to 24 months postsurgery and may potentially accelerate patient return to normal function, while reducing postoperative muscle loss, intra-articular adhesions, and associated gait abnormalities.",1

The principle and methods of tissue engineering were used. BMSCs were separated and amplified in vitro, and human transforming growth factor-beta 1 (hTGF-beta 1) gene was transduced to the cells. Then, the cells were suspended in the alginate. At the same time using mosaicplasty to repair the defects on the medial femoral condyle, the dead space between the cylindrical grafts were filled with the gels of hTGF-beta 1 gene transduced BMSCs in alginate. Single mosaicplasty and mosaicplasty associated with the gels of non-gene transduced BMSCs in alginate were compared by the different time observation. All of the three treatments could repair the acute osteochondral defects. Mosaicplasty associated with gene enhanced tissue engineering had a better integration than single mosaicplasty, and mosaicplasty associated with the gels of non-gene transduced BMSCs in alginate. Mosaicplasty associated with tissue engineering could solve the problem of the poor concrescence of the remnant defect and the integration of single mosaicplasty.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20205145,A Cellularized Biphasic Implant Based on a Bioactive Silk Fibroin Promotes Integration and Tissue Organization during Osteochondral Defect Repair in a Porcine Model,"In cartilage tissue engineering, biphasic scaffolds (BSs) have been designed not only to influence the recapitulation of the osteochondral architecture but also to take advantage of the healing ability of bone, promoting the implant’s integration with the surrounding tissue and then bone restoration and cartilage regeneration. This study reports the development and characterization of a BS based on the assembly of a cartilage phase constituted by fibroin biofunctionalyzed with a bovine cartilage matrix, cellularized with differentiated autologous pre-chondrocytes and well attached to a bone phase (decellularized bovine bone) to promote cartilage regeneration in a model of joint damage in pigs. BSs were assembled by fibroin crystallization with methanol, and the mechanical features and histological architectures were evaluated. The scaffolds were cellularized and matured for 12 days, then implanted into an osteochondral defect in a porcine model (n = 4). Three treatments were applied per knee: Group I, monophasic cellular scaffold (single chondral phase); group II (BS), cellularized only in the chondral phase; and in order to study the influence of the cellularization of the bone phase, Group III was cellularized in chondral phases and a bone phase, with autologous osteoblasts being included. After 8 weeks of surgery, the integration and regeneration tissues were analyzed via a histology and immunohistochemistry evaluation. The mechanical assessment showed that the acellular BSs reached a Young’s modulus of 805.01 kPa, similar to native cartilage. In vitro biological studies revealed the chondroinductive ability of the BSs, evidenced by an increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen, both secreted by the chondrocytes cultured on the scaffold during 28 days. No evidence of adverse or inflammatory reactions was observed in the in vivo trial; however, in Group I, the defects were not reconstructed. In Groups II and III, a good integration of the implant with the surrounding tissue was observed. Defects in group II were fulfilled via hyaline cartilage and normal bone. Group III defects showed fibrous repair tissue. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated the efficacy of a biphasic and bioactive scaffold based on silk fibroin and cellularized only in the chondral phase, which entwined chondroinductive features and a biomechanical capability with an appropriate integration with the surrounding tissue, representing a promising alternative for osteochondral tissue-engineering applications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-06148-5,Third generation autologous chondrocyte implantation is a good treatment option for athletic persons,"Abstract Purpose Autologous chondrocyte implantation is an established method for the treatment of joint cartilage damage. However, to date it has not been established that autologous chondrocyte implantation is an appropriate procedure for cartilage defects therapy in athletic persons. The aim of this study is to analyze if third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation is an appropriate treatment for athletic persons with full cartilage defect of the knee joints. Methods A total of 84 patients were treated with third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (NOVOCART ® 3D). The mean follow-up time was 8 years (5–14). Sports activity was measured via UCLA Activity Score and Tegner Activity Scale before the onset of knee pain and postoperatively in an annual clinical evaluation. 41 athletic persons and 43 non-athletic persons (UCLA-Cut-off: 7; Tegner Activity Scale-Cut-off: 4) were analyzed. Patient reported outcomes were captured using IKDC subjective, KOOS, Lysholm score and VAS score on movement. Results Patient reported outcomes (IKDC, VAS at rest, VAS on movement) showed significant improvement ( p &lt; 0.001) postoperatively. Athletic persons demonstrated significantly better results than non-athletic persons in the analyzed outcome scores (IKDC: p &lt; 0.01, KOOS: p &lt; 0.01, Lysholm score: p &lt; 0.01). 96.4% of the patients were able to return to sport and over 50% returned or surpassed their preinjury sports level. The remaining patients were downgraded by a median of two points on the UCLA- and 2.5 on the Tegner Activity Scale. A shift from high-impact sports to active events and moderate or mild activities was found. Furthermore, it was shown that preoperative UCLA score and Tegner Activity Scale correlated significantly with the patient reported outcome postoperatively. Conclusion Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a suitable treatment option for athletic persons with full-thickness cartilage defects in the knee. The return to sports activity is possible, but includes a shift from high-impact sports to less strenuous activities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-006-0333-z,MR imaging of osteochondral grafts and autologous chondrocyte implantation,"Surgical articular cartilage repair therapies for cartilage defects such as osteochondral autograft transfer, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or matrix associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) are becoming more common. MRI has become the method of choice for non-invasive follow-up of patients after cartilage repair surgery. It should be performed with cartilage sensitive sequences, including fat-suppressed proton density-weighted T2 fast spin-echo (PD/T2-FSE) and three-dimensional gradient-echo (3D GRE) sequences, which provide good signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. A thorough magnetic resonance (MR)-based assessment of cartilage repair tissue includes evaluations of defect filling, the surface and structure of repair tissue, the signal intensity of repair tissue and the subchondral bone status. Furthermore, in osteochondral autografts surface congruity, osseous incorporation and the donor site should be assessed. High spatial resolution is mandatory and can be achieved either by using a surface coil with a 1.5-T scanner or with a knee coil at 3 T; it is particularly important for assessing graft morphology and integration. Moreover, MR imaging facilitates assessment of complications including periosteal hypertrophy, delamination, adhesions, surface incongruence and reactive changes such as effusions and synovitis. Ongoing developments include isotropic 3D sequences, for improved morphological analysis, and in vivo biochemical imaging such as dGEMRIC, T2 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging, which make functional analysis of cartilage possible.",0

Hypothesis: A significant improvement in clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of symptomatic, traumatic chondral defects of the knee with the MACI implant will be maintained up to 5 years after surgery. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A prospective evaluation of the MACI procedure was performed in 21 patients with chondral defects of the knee. After the MACI procedure, patients were clinically assessed with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Tegner-Lysholm score, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and the modified Cincinnati score at years 1, 2, and 5. The quality of repair tissue was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score at months 3 and 6 and years 1, 2, and 5. Results: Significant improvements ( P &lt; .05) were observed for all 5 KOOS subcategories at year 1 and were maintained through year 5 in 90.5% of patients (19/21). Treatment failure occurred in only 9.5% of patients (2/21). Significant improvements ( P &lt; .05) from baseline to year 5 were also observed for the IKDC score (30.1 to 74.3), the modified Cincinnati score (38.1 to 79.6), and the Tegner-Lysholm activity score (1.8 to 4.3). Similarly, the MOCART score significantly improved ( P &lt; .001) from baseline to year 5 (52.9 to 75.8). After 5 years, complete filling (83%) and integration (82%) of the graft were seen in the majority of patients. Signs of subchondral bone edema were still present in 47% of patients at 5 years. No product-specific adverse events were reported over the 5-year follow-up period. Conclusion: Patients treated with a MACI implant demonstrated significant clinical improvement and good quality repair tissue 5 years after surgery. The MACI procedure was shown to be a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic, traumatic chondral knee defects in this study.",0

The biomechanical stability of a bladelike device that lowers intraosseous stress levels by distributing the load over a greater volume of bone was compared with conventional locking bolts in osteoporotic bone.Standardized simulated comminuted supracondylar femoral fractures (segmental defect) in fresh-frozen paired osteoporotic (bone mineral density <200 milligrams per cubic centimeter) human cadaveric femurs were stabilized with a retrograde unreamed distal femoral nail and distally interlocked with conventional locking bolts or a bladelike device. The distal portions of the fixator-bone constructs were tested under axial load, and the stiffness and strength were compared (pairwise).Interlocking with a bladelike device was 41 percent stiffer (p = 0.01) and 20 percent stronger (p = 0.02) than that with conventional locking bolts. All posttesting radiographs showed compaction of the cancellous bone distal to the interlocking devices. Even after nail displacements of twelve millimeters, only a few locking bolts were plastically deformed and no bladelike device showed gross plastic deformation.This study showed the biomechanical benefits of increasing the bone-implant interface surface for improving the acute stiffness and strength of fracture fixation in osteoporotic cancellous bone. The fixator-bone construct withstood higher forces before failure in these fragile bones.",0

We present the indications, operative technique, and results for the combined operation of high tibial osteotomy and cruciate ligament reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1996 until December 2000, 58 patients (average age: 33 years) underwent simultaneous osteotomy (57 correcting valgus, 1 valgus malalignment) and cruciate ligament reconstruction (49 ACL, 7 PCL, 2 ACL & PCL) which was routinely performed with an arthroscopic technique after completion of the osteotomy (closed wedge technique). Average correction angle of the osteotomy was 7 degrees (4-10 degrees) with a mean malalignment of 5 degrees (0-10 degrees). Thirteen patients underwent additional cartilage surgery (osteochondral autograft transplantation, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, microfracturing), and two patients were implanted with a collagen meniscus (CMI) at the same time. RESULTS: Preoperatively the Lysholm score was 66 (35-81) points and increased to 81 (74-95), 87 (79-99), and 93 (88-99) points 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, respectively. Subjectively all patients reported an improvement of preoperative swelling, pain, and instability. Additional cartilage surgery or meniscus implantation did not significantly alter the clinical score values. Complications were noted in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: Unstable knees with varus malalignment can be sufficiently treated by osteotomy and cruciate ligament reconstruction at the same time, suggesting that unicompartimental decompression and treatment of instability is a causal and cost-effective therapy delaying the progression of osteoarthritis and minimizing clinical symptoms. Performing both operations in one procedure facilitates early rehabilitation and the return of these patients to the activities of daily living and sports.",0

We present preliminary data on a combined autologous bone and cartilage chips: autologous dual-tissue transplantation (ADTT); an easily applicable, low-cost treatment option for osteochondral repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the early biological and clinical outcome of ADTT.Eight patients (age 32 ± 7.5 years) suffering from osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the knee were enrolled. The OCD lesion was debrided and the osteochondral defect was filled with autologous bone, to a level at the base of the adjacent cartilage. Cartilage biopsies from the intercondylar notch were chipped and embedded within fibrin glue in the defect. Evaluation was performed using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and clinical scores, preoperative and 1 year postoperative.Cartilage tissue repair evaluated using MOCART score improved from 22.5 to 52.5 (P < 0.01). Computed tomography imaging demonstrated very good subchondral bone healing with all 8 patients having a bone filling of >80%. We found improvements 1 year postoperative in the International Knee Documentation Committee score (from 35.9 to 68.1, P < 0.01), Tegner score (from 2.6 to 4.7, P < 0.05), and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score pain, symptoms, sport/recreation and quality of life (P < 0.05).Treatment of OCD with ADTT resulted in very good subchondral bone restoration and good cartilage repair. Significant improvements in patient reported outcome was found at 1 year postoperative. This study suggests ADTT as a promising, low-cost, treatment option for osteochondral injuries.",0

Systematic literature review, critical survey analysis, and definition","While midterm results of matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) are now available, less attention has been paid to the evaluation of failures of this surgical approach. Aim of this study was to analyse how “failures” are generally defined in cartilage surgery, in order to understand how the survival rate may change according to different definitions of failure. A systematic review on MACT in the knee was conducted to report failure rates as well as different failure definitions in the available literature. Afterwards, we analysed the survival curve at 8.5-year follow-up of a survey of 193 patients treated with MACT. Using different definitions to identify failures, we compared how the survival rate changed according to the different definitions of failure. The systematic review on 93 papers showed that the average failure rate reported on 3,289 patients was 5.2 % at a mean 34 months of follow-up. However, 41 studies (44.1 %) did not even consider this aspect, and failures were variously defined, thus generating confusing data that make a meta-analysis or a study comparison meaningless. The failure analysis of the MACT survey showed that the survival curve changed significantly depending on the definition applied; in fact, the failure rate ranged from 3.6 to 33.7 %. According to a critical literature and survey analysis, we proposed a combined surgical- and improvement-based definition which led to a failure rate of 25.9 % at midterm/long-term follow-up. Nowadays, failure definitions of cartilage treatments differ in scientific articles, thus generating confusion and heterogeneous data even when applied to the same cohort of patients. While the literature analysis shows a low number of failures, this study demonstrated that if properly addressed with a comprehensive definition, the real failure rate of cartilage surgical procedures in the knee is higher than previously reported. Recognizing failures would give a better understanding and a more realistic prognosis to patients and physicians seeking treatment for cartilage lesions. IV.",0

We hypothesized that ex vivo impacting of osteochondral autografts results in higher chondrocyte matrix production versus intact osteochondral autograft plugs. Design This institutional review board–approved study characterizes the effects of impacting osteochondral plugs harvested from the intercondylar notch of 16 patients into a paste, leaving one graft intact as a control. Cell viability/proliferation, collagen type I/II, SOX-9, and aggrecan gene expression via qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were analyzed at 24 and 48 hours. Matrix production and cell morphology were evaluated using histology. Results Paste samples from patients (mean age 39.7) with moderate (19%) to severe (81%) cartilage lesions displayed 34% and 80% greater cell proliferation compared to plugs at 24 and 48 hours post processing, respectively ( P = 0.015 and P = 0.021). qRT-PCR analysis yielded a significant ( P = 0.000) increase of aggrecan, SOX-9, collagen type I and II at both 24 and 48 hours. Histological examination displayed cell division throughout paste samples, with accumulation of aggrecan around multiple chondrocyte lacunae. Conclusions Paste graft preparation resulted in increased mobility of chondrocytes by matrix disruption without loss of cell viability. The impaction procedure stimulated chondrocyte proliferation resulting in a cellular response to reestablish native extracellular matrix. Analysis of gene expression supports a regenerative process of cartilage tissue formation and contradicts long-held beliefs that impaction trauma leads to immediate cell death. This mechanism of action translates into clinical benefit for patients with moderate to severe cartilage damage.",0

The repair tissue was described with separate variables: degree of defect repair in width and length, surface, structure and signal intensity of the repair tissue, and status of the subchondral lamina and bone. For these variables, a grading system with point-scale evaluation was applied, and the mean average values were calculated for every follow-up MR exam of each patient.In 10 patients, an incomplete filling of the defect improved to complete filling (6 patients) or less incomplete (4 patients) filling of the defect. Three cases of implant hypertrophy returned to normal within 1 year. Complete filling of the defect by repair tissue was found in 2 patients from the beginning. Integration was complete in 10 cases. Improvement of incomplete to complete integration was found in 3 patients. The signal intensity of the implant developed to native cartilage signal in 13 patients. The mean average values increased from the 4th to the 52 nd week in 17 of 20 patients and decreased in 3 of 20 patients.High-resolution MRI provides a noninvasive tool for monitoring the development of cartilage repair tissue in MACI over time and helps to differentiate abnormal repair tissue from a normal maturation process.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2020.06.015,Arthroscopic-Assisted Intraosseous Bioplasty of the Acetabulum,"Intraosseous bioplasty (IOBP), has been previously described for arthroscopic-assisted treatment of subchondral bone cysts in the proximal tibia associated with early stages of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This technique entails combining bone marrow aspirate concentrate or concentrated platelet-rich plasma with demineralized bone matrix as a bone substitute before injecting into a subchondral bone defect under fluoroscopic guidance. The principles of IOBP as a procedure that combines core decompression with biologic bone substitute augmentation can be extended to treat subchondral bone marrow lesions such as acetabular and femoral cysts in degenerative hip OA. Intraosseous bioplasty of the hip, in particular the acetabulum, when done using this technique, is a useful alternative that can be beneficial in treating young patients with early hip arthritis to achieve successful outcomes while delaying more invasive procedures. The Technical Note described here presents a step-by-step approach, including tips and pearls for arthroscopic-assisted IOBP with decompression of the subchondral cyst in the acetabulum followed by bone substitute injection under fluoroscopic guidance. We believe this method is a safe and reproducible way to treat subchondral defects in young patients with signs of early osteoarthritis of the hip joint.",0

Here, three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, dGEMRIC (delayed Gadolinium enhanced MRI of cartilage; dG1=T1,post; dG2=1/T1,post-1/T1,pre), T1ρ,and sodium MRI, are compared in a preclinical in vivo study to evaluate the differences in their potential for cartilage characterization and to establish an examination protocol for a following clinical study.OA was induced in 12 caprine knees (6 control, 6 therapy). Adipose derived stem cells were injected afterwards as a treatment. The animals were examined healthy, 3 and 16 weeks postoperatively with all three MRI methods. Using statistical analysis, the OA development and the degree of correlation between the different MRI methods were determined.A strong correlation was observed between the dGEMRIC indices dG1 and dG2 (r=-0.87) which differ only in considering or not considering the T1 baseline. Moderate correlations were found between T1ρ and dG1 (r=0.55), T1ρ and dG2 (r=0.47) and at last, sodium and dG1 (r=0.45). The correlations found in this study match to the biomarkers which the methods are sensitive to.Even though the goat cartilage is significantly thinner than the human cartilage and even more in a degenerated cartilage, all three methods were able to characterize the cartilage over the whole period of time during an ongoing OA. Due to measurement and post processing optimizations, as well as the correlations detected in this work, the overall measurement time in future goat studies can be minimized. Moreover, an examination protocol for characterizing the cartilage in a clinical study was established.",0

Demographic factors such as age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities were collected for all patients. Size and location of the osteochondral lesions also were documented. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 14 patients were identified with a mean follow-up of 19 months. On average, patients were 34 years of age (range 16-58 years) and 43% were female. Postoperatively, knee flexion increased by 8° from 124° to 132° (<i>P</i> = .002). All patients regained full extension; however, 1 patient later acquired a 2° extension contracture after a traumatic event. The average hamstring strength significantly increased from 4.1 to 4.6 postoperatively (<i>P</i> = .33). The average quadriceps strength significantly increased from 4.0 to 4.5 postoperatively (<i>P</i> = .007). Mean visual analog scale scores significantly decreased postoperatively (4.5 vs 1.4; <i>P</i> = .001). There was a significant increase in Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living scores (53.8 vs 92.9; <i>P</i> = .007). Mean Knee Outcome Survey-Sports scores also increased, although this was nonsignificant (28.2 vs 79.5; <i>P</i> = .560). No significant differences were noted in pain and functional outcomes when stratified by the osteochondral defect size and location. Complications included a stitch abscess, Baker's cyst, and residual pain treated with hyaluronic acid injection. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This study demonstrated arthroscopic BMAC and CDM implantation appears to be safe and has the potential to improve patient outcomes in the short-term postoperative period. <h3>Level of Evidence</h3> IV, therapeutic case series.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1636834,Comparison of Techniques for Preimplantation Treatment of Osteochondral Allograft Bone,"Abstract Articular defects are a major problem with few effective treatment options. Osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation can be an effective treatment; however, lack of OCA bone integration can cause failure. This controlled laboratory study was designed to compare clinically applicable methods for marrow element removal and enhanced delivery of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) to OCA bone. We hypothesized that compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) treatment of OCA bone would result in significantly better marrow element removal, significantly more retention and distribution of viable osteoprogenitor cells, and significantly higher osteoinductive protein elution from OCAs compared with other preimplantation treatments. Fresh humeral heads (n = 24) were harvested and stored for 14 days, then randomly assigned to treatment based on marrow element removal and bone treatment: (standard of care [SOC]) (n = 4) – SOC high-pulse saline lavage, no BMC; (BMC) (n = 5) – saline lavage then canine BMC; (Drill + BMC) (n = 5) – 1.1 mm drill-hole immediately subchondral then saline lavage then BMC injection through drill hole; (Carb + BMC) (n = 5) – saline lavage then CO2 then BMC; or (Saline-Carb + BMC) (n = 5) – saline lavage and CO2 together then BMC. Treated OCAs were cultured for 14 days. On day 3, media were collected, centrifuged to isolate cells, and replaced. Cells were cultured for 11 days for colony forming unit (CFU) determination. OCA media were collected on days 7 and 14 of culture for analysis. On day 14, each graft was assessed for viable cell retention and distribution, and bone marrow element removal. BMC had significantly higher (p = 0.001) viable cell distribution compared with the SOC, Drill + BMC, Carb + BMC, and Saline-Carb + BMC groups. BMC and Drill + BMC had significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) CFUs than SOC, Carb + BMC, and Saline-Carb + BMC. Drill + BMC and Carb + BMC had the highest media concentrations of the osteoinductive biomarkers. The Carb + BMC and Saline-Carb + BMC groups were associated with significantly superior marrow element removal (p &lt; 0.02) compared with the SOC, Drill + BMC, and BMC groups. Saline irrigation plus saturation with autogenous BMC appears to be the most advantageous preimplantation treatment for OCA transplantation.",0

Although recent studies have reported the successful treatment of articular defects in the knee and ankle joints with this surgical procedure, little attention has been given to the surgical efficacy of mosaicplasty in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum. Purpose To clarify the clinical outcomes of mosaicplasty for teenaged patients with advanced lesions of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Eight teenaged patients with advanced lesions of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans underwent mosaicplasties. All patients were baseball players who were affected on the right side, which was also their throwing side. The surgical technique involves obtaining small-sized cylindrical osteochondral grafts from the lateral periphery of the femoral condyles and transplanting them to prepared osteochondral defects. At a mean follow-up of 24 months, all patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically. Results Seven of the 8 patients were free from elbow pain, and the remaining patient had mild pain occasionally. The mean clinical score described by Timmerman and Andrews (a maximum of 200 points) significantly improved from 140 points to 183 points postoperatively. All patients except one had excellent or good clinical results. Radiographically, the graft incorporation and a normal contour of the subchondral cortex were found in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the preoperative heterogeneity of the lesion had disappeared and the signal intensity returned to normal. Six of the 8 patients, including all 3 pitchers, returned to competitive-level baseball. Conclusion Mosaicplasty for advanced lesions of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans in teenaged baseball players can provide satisfactory clinical and radiographic results.",0

The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical outcome obtained with the treatment for isolated degenerative knee cartilage lesions by second-generation arthroscopic autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Fifty-eight consecutive patients affected by focal degenerative chondral lesions of the femoral condyles and trochlea were treated by second-generation arthroscopic ACI. The mean age at surgery was 34.7 +/- A 9.1 years and the average defect size was 2.3 +/- A 0.9 cm(2). The patients were prospectively evaluated with IKDC, EQ-VAS, and Tegner scores preoperatively, at 2 and 6 years. A statistically significant improvement was observed in all scores from the basal evaluation to the final follow-up. The IKDC subjective score improved from 39.3 +/- A 13.6 to 68.8 +/- A 22.7 and 68.5 +/- A 23.9 at the 2- and 6-year follow-ups, respectively, with a significant improvement (P \textbackslashtextless 0.0005) and stable results over time; the same trend was confirmed by the EQ-VAS and Tegner scores. The worst results were found in patients with a low physical activity level, women, and those having undergone previous surgery, whereas the symptom duration before surgery did not influence the final outcome. The failure rate was 18.5%. Despite a significant improvement, the results were lower with respect to the outcome reported in different study populations, and the number of failures was markedly higher, too. Tissue-engineered cartilage implantation is a promising approach for the treatment of degenerative chondral lesions, but graft properties, besides mechanical and biochemical joint environment, have to be improved.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-012-2148-6,Culture of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells on of poly(l-lactic acid) scaffolds: potential application for the tissue engineering of cartilage,"Due to the attractive properties of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) for tissue engineering, the aim was to determine the growth and differentiation capacity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in PLLA scaffolds and their potential use in the treatment of cartilage diseases. MSCs were cultured in PLLA films and thin porous membranes to study adherence and proliferation. Permeability and porosity were determined for the different scaffolds employed. The optimal conditions for cell seeding were first determined, as well as cell density and distribution inside the PLLA. Scaffolds were then maintained in expansion or chondrogenic differentiation media for 21 days. Apoptosis, proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation was assessed after 21 days in culture by immunohistochemistry. Mechanical characteristics of scaffolds were determined before and after cell seeding. MSCs uniformly adhered to PLLA films as well as to porous membranes. Proliferation was detected only in monolayers of pure PLLA, but was no longer detected after 10 days. Mechanical characterization of PLLA scaffolds showed differences in the apparent compression elastic modulus for the two sizes used. After determining high efficiencies of seeding, the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) was determined and contained aggrecan and collagens type I and X. ECM produced by the cells induced a twofold increase in the apparent elastic modulus of the composite. Biocompatible PLLA scaffolds have been developed that can be efficiently loaded with MSCs. The scaffold supports chondrogenic differentiation and ECM deposition that improves the mechanics of the scaffold. Although this improvement does not met the expectations of a hyaline-like cartilage ECM, in part due to the lack of a mechanical stimulation, their potential use in the treatment of cartilage pathologies encourages to improve the mechanical component.",0

Methods A systematic review of the literature in Medline (Pubmed) and Embase was performed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Articles which reported the post-operative MRI morphological outcomes following the use of third-generation ACI for treatment of knee cartilage lesions were included. All MRI results were allocated to six different time intervals: \textbackslashtextless= 3 months, \textbackslashtextgreater 3-6 months, \textbackslashtextgreater 6 months-1 year, \textbackslashtextgreater 1 year-2 years, \textbackslashtextgreater 2-5 years and \textbackslashtextgreater 5 years after surgery. Results A total of 22 studies were included and the study populations ranged from 13 to 180 patients adding up to a total of 951 patients. Parameters such as defect fill, border integration, surface contour, graft morphology and integrity of the subchondral lamina all improve gradually with a peak two years following surgery suggesting complete graft maturation at this time point. After this peak, a statistically insignificant decline is noted for most of the parameters. Signal intensity was found to gradually shift from hyperintense to isointense in the first 36 months and to hypointense later on. Contrarily, subchondral bone edema is not only a postoperative feature of the procedure but also can reappear or persist up to ten years after surgery. As graft failures can appear after two years, consequently, the MRI composite score is also affected. Conclusion Recurring patterns in postoperative MRI appearance were observed in certain parameters including defect filling, graft signal intensity and structure, border integration of the graft while parameters like subchondral bone tend to be unpredictable. Given the heterogenous findings in terms of clinical correlation, and relating that aspect to the patterns found in this review, an MRI is justified at three months, one year, two years and five years after surgery, unless the clinical symptomatology and individual patient needs dictate otherwise.",0

Scoring was repeated after a 2-month interval. Scorers also answered a questionnaire to assess the face and content validity of the scoring systems. Validity of the 2 systems was compared and reliability and repeatability were measured. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to measure equivalence reliability. The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the repeatability and inter-rater reliability of each score, and internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha. <b>Results:</b> Face and content validity are acceptable for both scores. There is good agreement (equivalence reliability) between the scores (Pearson's correlation coefficient, <i>r</i> = .88; <i>P</i> < .001). Stability (interobserver reliability) and repeatability (test-retest reliability) are satisfactory for both scores with an ICC >0.7 for each score. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91 for ICRS and 0.82 for OAS, indicating better internal consistency for the ICRS score. <b>Conclusions:</b> The ICRS and OAS arthroscopic scores have been validated for the assessment of cartilage repair and both have been found to be statistically reliable and repeatable. The ICRS score does not allow for graft hypertrophy and may overscore in this situation, whereas the OAS includes assessment of graft stiffness. Both scores show satisfactory stability and repeatability. Internal consistency is adequate for both scores, although it is higher for the ICRS score. Both the ICRS and OAS arthroscopic scores are effective tools in the evaluation of cartilage repair. <b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level III, diagnostic study of nonconsecutive patients (no consistently applied reference gold standard).",0

There may be no problem if there is depression of the grafted plugs, but graft protuberance may have an adverse effect. We studied five knees in five patients who had incongruity (protuberance or depression) of grafted osteochondral plugs at the time of mosaicplasty. The mean age at surgery was 36.6 years (range, 15-65 years), and the mean follow-up period was 32.9 months (range, 24-49 months). All patients underwent second-look arthroscopy after a mean post-surgical period of 14.8 months (range, 3-18 months). We divided the cases so that there were two in the protuberant group (P) and three in the depressed group (D). In P, all patients had a catching sensation about 4 months after surgery, and sometimes pain in the knee joint. Second-look arthroscopy revealed fissuring of the plugs and fibrillation around the recipient site. In D, there were no symptoms due to the depressed plugs. Second-look arthroscopy showed that the depressed areas were covered with fibrocartilage-like tissue, and that the joint surface was smooth. In conclusion, our clinical results and second-look arthroscopic evaluation suggest that isolated osteochondral plug depressions of not greater than 1 mm could still promote acceptable cartilage healing leading to good clinical outcomes. However, plug protuberance at mosaicplasty should always be avoided.",0

All the studies that involved OCT were identified. Only Level I and II studies that compared OCT to other modalities of treatment such as microfracture (MF) and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) were selected.A total of 8 studies matched the selection criteria with 2 Level I and 6 Level II studies. Four studies compared OCT with MF, 3 compared OCT with ACI, and one compared all 3 techniques. Of 3 studies, 4 came from a single center. Mean age of patients ranged from 24 to 33 years, and mean follow-up ranged from 9 to 124 months. The studies from the single center showed superior results from OCT over MF, especially in younger patients, with one study having long-term follow-up of 10 years. They also showed an earlier return to sports. The size of the lesions were small (average < 3 cm(2)). The 4 other independent studies did not show any difference between OCT and ACI, with one study showing inferior outcome in the OCT group. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed good osseous integration of the osteochondral plugs to the subchondral bone. Histologic examination showed that there was hyaline cartilage in the transplanted osteochondral plugs but no hyaline cartilage between the plugs.From the studies of a single center, OCT had an advantage over MF in younger patients with small chondral lesions. Comparison of outcomes between OCT and ACI showed no significant difference in 2 studies and contrasting results in another 2 studies. There was insufficient evidence for long-term results for OCT.Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.",0

Included studies were evaluated with regard to the level of evidence (LOE) and quality of evidence (QOE) using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score. Variable reporting outcome data, clinical outcomes, and the percentage of patients who returned to sport at previous level were also evaluated.Twenty-eight studies for a total of 897 ankles were included; 96% were either LOE III or IV. Studies were designated as either of poor or fair quality. There were 30 treatment groups reporting six different scaffold repair techniques: 13 matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT), nine bone marrow derived cell transplantation (BMDCT), four autologous matrix-induced chondrogeneis (AMIC), and four studies of other techniques. The categories of general demographics (93%) and patient-reported outcome data (85%) were well reported.

If left untreated, such an injury may progress to osteoarthritis, a degenerative and debilitating joint disease characterized by pain and functional impairment. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have immune-modulatory properties and the ability to differentiate into chondroblasts and osteoblasts, are a predictable source for the treatment of cartilage injuries. This article presents tools to evaluate cartilage restoration by tissue engineering and cell therapy treatment in a translational and preclinical large animal model. In this controlled experimental study with 14 miniature pigs, a scaffold-free tissue engineering construct (TEC) derived from dental pulp and synovial MSCs for cartilage therapy was tested. Total thickness cartilage defects were performed in both posterior knees. The defect was left empty in one of the knees, and the other received the TEC. The tissue repair was morphologically assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the three-dimensional double echo steady-state (3D-DESS) sequence, and compositional assessment was carried out based on the T2 mapping technique. The osteochondral specimens were fixed for histopathology, decalcified, subjected to standard histological processing, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections stained for immunohistochemical detection of collagen types were digested with pepsin and chondroitinase and incubated with antibodies against them. The mechanical evaluation involved analysis of Young's modulus of the cartilage samples based on the indentation and maximum compression test. In addition, a finite element model was used to simulate and characterize properties of the osteochondral block. At 6 months after surgery, there were no complications with the animals and the MRI, histological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical evaluations proved to be effective and qualified to differentiate good quality chondral repair from inadequate repair tissue. The proposed methods were feasible and capable to properly evaluate the defect filled with TEC containing stromal cells after 6 months of follow-up in a large animal model for articular cartilage restoration. Impact Statement Articular chondral injuries are prevalent and represent an economic burden due to the cost of treatment. The engineering of cartilage tissue can promote the repair of chondral injuries and is dependent on selecting appropriate cells and biocompatible frameworks. In this article, methods for evaluation of a scaffold-free cell delivery system made from mesenchymal stromal cells were present in a translational study that allows further clinical safety and efficacy trials.",0

The authors developed arthroscopic transplantation of osteochondral autograft from lateral femoral condyle to distal radius with satisfactory outcome in 4 consecutive patients between December 2006 and December 2010. In all cases, graft incorporation was completed by 3 months to 4 months postoperation. All patients showed improvement in wrist function with no pain at follow-up at an average of 70.5 months (range 24-116 months). Second-look arthroscopy in 3 patients confirmed the preservation of normal articular cartilage. Patient satisfaction was high with no complications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120968119,Injectable amnion hydrogel-mediated delivery of adipose-derived stem cells for osteoarthritis treatment,"Current treatment strategies for osteoarthritis (OA) predominantly address symptoms with limited disease-modifying potential. There is a growing interest in the use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for OA treatment and developing biomimetic injectable hydrogels as cell delivery systems. Biomimetic injectable hydrogels can simulate the native tissue microenvironment by providing appropriate biological and chemical cues for tissue regeneration. A biomimetic injectable hydrogel using amnion membrane (AM) was developed which can self-assemble in situ and retain the stem cells at the target site. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of intraarticular injections of AM hydrogels with and without ADSCs in reducing inflammation and cartilage degeneration in a collagenase-induced OA rat model. A week after the induction of OA, rats were treated with control (phosphate-buffered saline), ADSCs, AM gel, and AM-ADSCs. Inflammation and cartilage regeneration was evaluated by joint swelling, analysis of serum by cytokine profiling and Raman spectroscopy, gross appearance, and histology. Both AM and ADSC possess antiinflammatory and chondroprotective properties to target the sites of inflammation in an osteoarthritic joint, thereby reducing the inflammation-mediated damage to the articular cartilage. The present study demonstrated the potential of AM hydrogel to foster cartilage tissue regeneration, a comparable regenerative effect of AM hydrogel and ADSCs, and the synergistic antiinflammatory and chondroprotective effects of AM and ADSC to regenerate cartilage tissue in a rat OA model.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516648644,BioCartilage Improves Cartilage Repair Compared With Microfracture Alone in an Equine Model of Full-Thickness Cartilage Loss,"Background: Microfracture (MFx) remains a dominant treatment strategy for symptomatic articular cartilage defects. Biologic scaffold adjuncts, such as particulated allograft articular cartilage (BioCartilage) combined with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), offer promise in improving clinical outcomes as an adjunct to MFx. Purpose: To evaluate the safety, biocompatibility, and efficacy of BioCartilage and PRP for cartilage repair in a preclinical equine model of full-thickness articular cartilage loss. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Two 10-mm-diameter full-thickness cartilage defects were created in 5 horses in the trochlear ridge of both knees: one proximal (high load) and another distal (low load). Complete blood counts were performed on each peripheral blood and resultant PRP sample. In each horse, one knee received MFx with BioCartilage + PRP, and the other knee received MFx alone. Horses were euthanized at 13 months. Outcomes were assessed with serial arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro–computed tomography (micro-CT), and histology. Statistics were performed using a mixed-effects model with response variable contrasts. Results: No complications occurred. PRP generated in all subjects yielded an increase in platelet fold of 3.8 ± 4.7. Leukocyte concentration decreased in PRP samples by an average fold change of 5 ± 0.1. The overall International Cartilage Repair Society repair score in both the proximal and distal defects was significantly higher (better) in the BioCartilage group compared with MFx (proximal BioCartilage: 7.4 ± 0.51, MFx 4.8 ± 0.1, P = .041; distal BioCartilage: 5.6 ± 0.98, MFx 2.6 ± 1.5, P = .022). BioCartilage-treated proximal defects demonstrated improved histologic scores for repair-host integration (BioCartilage, 96 ± 9; MFx, 68 ± 18; P = .02), base integration (BioCartilage, 100 ± 0; MFx, 70 ± 37; P = .04), and formation of collagen type II (BioCartilage, 82 ± 8; MFx, 58 ± 11; P = .05) compared with the positive control. On MRI, T2 relaxation time was significantly shorter (better) in the superficial region of BioCartilage-treated distal defects compared with MFx ( P = .05). There were no significant differences between BioCartilage and MFx on micro-CT analysis. Conclusion: BioCartilage with PRP safely improved cartilage repair compared with MFx alone in an equine model of articular cartilage defects up to 13 months after implantation. Clinical Relevance: The 1-year results of BioCartilage + PRP suggest that homologous allograft tissue provides a safe and effective augmentation of traditional MFx.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation is the current gold standard but the technique is expensive, time-consuming and most versions require two stage procedures and an arthrotomy. Autologous collagen induced chondrogenesis (ACIC) is a single-stage arthroscopic procedure and we developed. This method uses microfracture technique with atelocollagen mixed with fibrin gel to treat articular cartilage defects. We introduce this ACIC techniques and its scientific background.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-013-1711-z,Incongruity affecting osteochondral repair by mosaicplasty technique in an animal model,"To compare the influence of the different osteochondral incongruity grades on the osteochondral repair by the mosaicplasty technique in a goat model. The acute defects were created in the weight-bearing area of the medial femoral condyle of the goats. Mosaicplasty was done to repair the defects. While implanting the cylindrical osteochondral grafts, different osteochondral sunk, or elevated incongruities were created. The goats were killed 12 weeks after operation to receive gross and histology observation, which was evaluated by the histological grading scale of O'Driscoll et al. The specimens were also taken for transmission electron microscope examination. Two factors analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Kewls test were used to compare the specimen. Minimal steps, which were less than the thickness of cartilage, possess a capacity for remodeling that can correct initial incongruities while preserving hyaline characteristics. However, the step more than the thickness of cartilage could not be repaired satisfactorily. The incongruity could have an influence on the repair by the mosaicplasty technique in a goat model. The limited incongruity could be repaired by a vigorous remodeling process.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19061755,Recent Approaches to the Manufacturing of Biomimetic Multi-Phasic Scaffolds for Osteochondral Regeneration,"Cartilage lesions of the knee are common disorders affecting people of all ages; as the lesion progresses, it extends to the underlying subchondral bone and an osteochondral defect appears. Osteochondral (OC) tissue compromises soft cartilage over hard subchondral bone with a calcified cartilage interface between these two tissues. Osteochondral defects can be caused by numerous factors such as trauma and arthritis. Tissue engineering offers the possibility of a sustainable and effective treatment against osteochondral defects, where the damaged tissue is replaced with a long-lasting bio-manufactured replacement tissue. This review evaluates both bi-phasic and multi-phasic scaffold-based approaches of osteochondral tissue regeneration, highlighting the importance of having an interface layer between the bone and cartilage layer. The significance of a biomimetic approach is also evidenced and shown to be more effective than the more homogenous design approach to osteochondral scaffold design. Recent scaffold materials and manufacturing techniques are reviewed as well as the current clinical progress with osteochondral regeneration scaffolds.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017001,Clinically Translatable Cell Tracking and Quantification by MRI in Cartilage Repair Using Superparamagnetic Iron Oxides,"Articular cartilage has very limited intrinsic regenerative capacity, making cell-based therapy a tempting approach for cartilage repair. Cell tracking can be a major step towards unraveling and improving the repair process of these therapies. We studied superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIO) for labeling human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) regarding effectivity, cell viability, long term metabolic cell activity, chondrogenic differentiation and hBMSC secretion profile. We additionally examined the capacity of synovial cells to endocytose SPIO from dead, labeled cells, together with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for intra-articular visualization and quantification of SPIO labeled cells.Efficacy and various safety aspects of SPIO cell labeling were determined using appropriate assays. Synovial SPIO re-uptake was investigated in vitro by co-labeling cells with SPIO and green fluorescent protein (GFP). MRI experiments were performed on a clinical 3.0T MRI scanner. Two cell-based cartilage repair techniques were mimicked for evaluating MRI traceability of labeled cells: intra-articular cell injection and cell implantation in cartilage defects. Cells were applied ex vivo or in vitro in an intra-articular environment and immediately scanned. SPIO labeling was effective and did not impair any of the studied safety aspects, including hBMSC secretion profile. SPIO from dead, labeled cells could be taken up by synovial cells. Both injected and implanted SPIO-labeled cells could accurately be visualized by MRI in a clinically relevant sized joint model using clinically applied cell doses. Finally, we quantified the amount of labeled cells seeded in cartilage defects using MR-based relaxometry.SPIO labeling appears to be safe without influencing cell behavior. SPIO labeled cells can be visualized in an intra-articular environment and quantified when seeded in cartilage defects.",0

We explored a novel matrix-based implant cartilage repair composed of both fibrin and hyaluronan in a defined ratio that takes advantage of the biological and mechanical properties of these two elements. The matrix was seeded with autologous chondrocytes expanded in the presence of a proprietary growth factor variant designed to preserve their chondrogenic potential. We prospectively followed eight patients with symptomatic-chronic cartilage defects treated with this carrier. Patients had arthroscopy to harvest autologous chondrocytes then grown in autologous serum. Chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of the FGF variant and then seeded on the fibrin-hyaluronan matrix. About 4 weeks following biopsy, the patients underwent implantation of the constructs by miniarthrotomy. Three of the eight patients had transient effusion. Clinical performance was measured by Lysholm and IKDC scores, MRI, and the need for secondary surgery. The clinical outcome of a 1-year followup demonstrated increase of clinical scores. The MRI followup showed good filling of the defect with tissue having the imaging appearance of cartilage in all patients. Apart from the transient effusion in three patients we observed no other adverse events during the followup.Level IV, therapeutic study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546509350045,Osteochondral Integration of Multiply Incised Pure Cartilage Allograft: Repair Method of Focal Chondral Defects in a Porcine Model,"A focal cartilage lesion has limited capacity to heal, and the repair modalities used at present are still unable to provide a universal solution. Pure cartilage graft implantation appears to be a simple option, but it has not been applied widely as cartilage will not reattach easily to the subchondral bone.We used a multiple-incision technique (processed chondrograft) to increase cartilage graft surface. We hypothesized that pure cartilage graft with augmented osteochondral fusion capacity may be used for cartilage repair and we compared this method with other repair techniques.Controlled laboratory study.Full-thickness focal cartilage defects were created on the medial femoral condyle of 9-month-old pigs; defects were repaired using various methods including bone marrow stimulation, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and processed chondrograft. After the repair, at weeks 6 and 24, macroscopic and histologic evaluation was carried out.Compared with other methods, processed chondrograft was found to be similarly effective in cartilage repair. Defects without repair and defects treated with bone marrow stimulation appeared slightly irregular with fibrocartilage filling. Autologous chondrocyte implantation produced hyalinelike cartilage, although its cellular organization was distinguishable from the surrounding articular cartilage. Processed chondrograft demonstrated good osteochondral integration, and the resulting tissue appeared to be hyaline cartilage.The applied cartilage surface processing method allows acceptable osteochondral integration, and the repair tissue appears to have good macroscopic and histologic characteristics.If further studies confirm its efficacy, this technique could be considered for human application in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10575,Regenerative Medicine for Knee Osteoarthritis – The Efficacy and Safety of Intra-Articular Platelet-Rich Plasma and Mesenchymal Stem Cells Injections: A Literature Review,"The prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) has been rising exponentially in recent years. As the disease progresses, patients may eventually require surgical intervention to restore the functionality of the affected knees. The current literature review aims to explore two treatment options in regenerative medicine for OA by analyzing the efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) use, as well as determining which population will benefit from these treatments. A total of 1093 patients who were diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral knee osteoarthritis (KOA) were recruited in 23 studies. The experimental groups received either PRP or MSCs injections in comparison to the control groups receiving either hyaluronic acid (HA) or placebo (saline or dextrose) injections. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to evaluate all participants at different time intervals of the studies. Medical imaging evaluations (X-ray or MRI) were used to look for structural improvements. In conclusion, both PRP and MSCs treatments were well tolerated, effective and safe to use. Repeated administrations and higher concentrations resulted in superior clinical improvements. A decrease in cartilage loss was observed in some MSCs trials. No severe adverse effects were documented. PRP treatment proved to be more efficacious among patients with KOA Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade I-II, while MSCs treatment proved to be more beneficial among the KOA KL grade II-III group.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-018-4898-2,The safety and efficacy of magnetic targeting using autologous mesenchymal stem cells for cartilage repair,"Purpose A new cell delivery system using magnetic force, termed magnetic targeting, was developed for the accumulation of locally injected cells in a lesion. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) magnetic targeting in patients with a focal articular cartilage defect in the knee. Methods MSC magnetic targeting for five patients was approved by the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare of Japan. Autologous bone marrow MSCs were cultured and subsequently magnetized with ferucarbotran. The 1.0-T compact magnet was attached to a suitable position around the knee joint to allow the magnetic force to be as perpendicular to the surface of the lesion as possible. Then 1 x 10(7) MSCs were injected into the knee joint. The magnet was maintained in the same position for 10 min after the MSC injection. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any adverse events. The secondary endpoints were efficacy assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping and clinical outcomes using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Results No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment or in the follow-up period. Swelling of the treated knee joint was observed from the day after surgery in three of the five patients. The swelling resolved within 2 weeks in two patients. MRI showed that the cartilage defect areas were almost completely filled with cartilage-like tissue. MOCART scores were significantly higher 48 weeks postoperatively than preoperatively (74.8 +/- 10.8 vs 27.0 +/- 16.8, p = 0.042). Arthroscopy in three patients showed complete coverage of their cartilage defects. Clinical outcome scores were significantly better 48 weeks postoperatively than preoperatively for the IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation (74.8 +/- 17.7 vs 46.9 +/- 17.7, p = 0.014) and knee-related quality-of-life (QOL) in the KOOS (53.8 +/- 26.4 vs 22.5 +/- 30.8, p = 0.012). Conclusion Magnetic targeting of MSCs was safely performed and showed complete coverage of the defects with cartilage-like tissues and significant improvement in clinical outcomes 48 weeks after treatment. The magnetic targeting of MSCs is useful as a minimally invasive treatment for cartilage repair.",0

Design: Eighteen rabbits were divided into 2 treatment groups. One group was treated with a microfracture and covering of it with gel-type fibrin (AutoBMS; n = 9), and the other group was treated with allogenic chondrocytes mixed gel-type fibrin at the cartilage defect (AlloCI; n = 9). The control group was untreated cartilage defect at the other side knee of each object. Twelve weeks after treatment, the cartilage was evaluated using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scoring system, immunohistochemical staining, and modified O’Driscoll grading system. Results: The ICRS scores were similar in the AutoBMS (9.44 ± 2.44) and the AlloCI (9.33 ± 1.67) groups ( P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed higher expression of cartilaginous collagen for both groups. The average difference (AutoBMS, 31.89 ± 6.54; AlloCI, 32.89 ± 5.25) in the modified O’Driscoll scores appeared to be nonsignificant ( P &gt; 0.05); however, both treatment groups showed significantly higher scores with respect to their control group (18.45 ± 1.65; 18.97 ± 1.58) ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: This experimental study suggests autologous bone marrow cells stimulation and implantation of allogenic chondrocytes are both useful methodologies for regenerating hyaline-like cartilage in full-thickness cartilage defects in animal model.",0

Postoperative MRI scans using quantitative T2 mapping were obtained and interpreted by an independent musculoskeletal radiologist.Twenty-seven patients treated with PJAC for 30 full-thickness patellofemoral cartilage lesions were identified; mean postoperative follow-up was 3.84 years. Improvements from pre- to postoperative mean IKDC (45.9 vs 71.2, P < .001) and KOS-ADL (60.7 vs 78.8, P < .001) scores were observed; no significant change in MAS was seen (7.04 vs 7.17, P = .97). Advanced age, history of previous surgery, lesion location (patella vs trochlea), or concomitant tibial tubercle osteotomy did not affect outcome scores. Greater body mass index was associated with less improvement in KOS-ADL score. No patients required reoperation for graft-related issues. Lesion fill exceeding 67% by MRI assessment was noted in 69.2% of lesions; depth of lesion fill did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Quantitative T2-mapping revealed prolonged relaxation time at the graft site compared with adjacent normal cartilage at both deep and superficial zones.This study found significantly improved pain and function in patients treated with PJAC for symptomatic patellofemoral articular cartilage defects. No patients required reoperation for graft-related issues. Postoperative MRI revealed majority lesion fill in more than 69% of patients, but persistent morphologic differences between graft site and normal adjacent cartilage remain. Though we support PJAC use in this setting to improve patient subjective outcomes, improved appearance on postoperative imaging was not found to provide additional clinical benefit.Level IV, case series.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s2255-4971(15)30339-6,UPDATING ON DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CHONDRAL LESION OF THE KNEE,"The treatment of chondral knee injuries remains a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon, mainly owing to the characteristics of the cartilage tissue, which promote low potential for regeneration. Chondral lesions can be caused by metabolic stimulation, or by genetic, vascular and traumatic events, and are classified according to the size and thickness of the affected cartilage. Clinical diagnosis can be difficult, especially due to insidious symptoms. Additional tests, as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), may be needed. The treatment of these lesions usually starts with non-operative management. Surgery should be reserved for patients with detached chondral fragments, blocked range of motion, or the failure of non-operative treatment. The surgical techniques used for the treatment of partial thickness defects are Debridement and Ablation. These techniques aim to improve symptoms, since they do not restore normal structure and function of the cartilage. For full-thickness defects (osteochondral lesion), available treatments are Abrasion, Drilling, Microfracture, Osteochondral Autologous and Allogeneic Transplantation, and biological techniques such as the use of Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation, Minced Cartilage and stem cells.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546513490658,Treatment of Knee Osteochondritis Dissecans With a Cell-Free Biomimetic Osteochondral Scaffold,"Background: Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is an acquired lesion of the subchondral bone that may result in separation and instability of the overlying articular cartilage. Unstable lesions must be treated surgically to reestablish the joint surface as anatomically as possible. Hypothesis/Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a biomimetic osteochondral scaffold to treat OCD by analyzing the results obtained at 2-year follow-up. The hypothesis was that this scaffold, which was developed to treat the entire osteochondral unit, might restore the articular surface and improve symptoms and function in patients affected by knee OCD. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Twenty-seven consecutive patients (19 men, 8 women; age [mean ± SD], 25.5 ± 7.7 years) who were affected by symptomatic knee OCD of the femoral condyles (average defect size 3.4 ± 2.2 cm 2 ), grade 3 or 4 on the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scale, were enrolled and treated with the implantation of a 3-layer collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold. Patients were prospectively evaluated by subjective and objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner scores preoperatively and at 1- and 2-year follow-up. An MRI was also performed at the 2 follow-up times. Results: A statistically significant improvement in all clinical scores was obtained at 1 year, and a further improvement was found the following year. At the 2-year follow-up, the IKDC subjective score had increased from 48.4 ± 17.8 preoperatively to 82.3 ± 12.2, the IKDC objective evaluation from 40% to 85% of normal knees, and the Tegner score from 2.4 ± 1.7 to 4.5 ± 1.6. The MRI evaluations showed good defect filling and implant integration but also inhomogeneous regenerated tissue and subchondral bone changes in most patients at both follow-up times. No correlation between the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score and clinical outcome was found. Conclusion: This biomimetic osteochondral scaffold seems to be a valid treatment option for knee OCD, showing a good clinical outcome at 2-year follow-up. Moreover, the improvement was not correlated with lesion size, so large lesions can benefit from this implant. Less favorable findings were obtained with MRI evaluation.",0

The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize chitosan-GP/blood clots in vitro, and (2) to develop a rabbit marrow stimulation model in order to determine the effects of the chitosan-GP/blood implant and of debridement on the formation of incipient cartilage repair tissue.Blood clots were characterized by histology and in vitro clot retraction tests. Bilateral 3.5 x 4 mm trochlear defects debrided into the calcified layer were pierced with four microdrill holes and filled with a chitosan-GP/blood implant or allowed to bleed freely as a control. At 1 day post-surgery, initial defects were characterized by histomorphometry (n=3). After 8 weeks of repair, osteochondral repair tissues between or through the drill holes were evaluated by histology, histomorphometry, collagen type II expression, and stereology (n=16).Chitosan-GP solutions structurally stabilized the blood clots by inhibiting clot retraction. Treatment of drilled defects with chitosan-GP/blood clots led to the formation of a more integrated and hyaline repair tissue above a more porous and vascularized subchondral bone plate compared to drilling alone. Correlation analysis of repair tissue between the drill holes revealed that the absence of calcified cartilage and the presence of a porous subchondral bone plate were predictors of greater repair tissue integration with subchondral bone (P<0.005), and of a higher total O'Driscoll score (P<0.005 and P<0.01, respectively).Chitosan-GP/blood implants applied in conjunction with drilling, compared to drilling alone, elicited a more hyaline and integrated repair tissue associated with a porous subchondral bone replete with blood vessels. Concomitant regeneration of a vascularized bone plate during cartilage repair could provide progenitors, anabolic factors and nutrients that aid in the formation of hyaline cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.04.013,Cartilage regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells and a PLGA–gelatin/chondroitin/hyaluronate hybrid scaffold,"The study was to produce a novel hybrid poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-gelatin/chondroitin/hyaluronate (PLGA-GCH) scaffold and evaluate its potentials in cartilage repair. The porous PLGA-GCH scaffold was developed to mimic the natural extra cellular matrix of cartilage. The differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded on PLGA-GCH or PLGA scaffold were incubated in vitro and showed that, compared to PLGA scaffold, the PLGA-GCH scaffold significantly augmented the proliferation of MSCs and GAG synthesis. Then autologous differentiated MSCs/PLGA-GCH was implanted to repair full-thickness cartilage defect in rabbit, while MSCs/PLGA for the contra lateral cartilage defect (n=30). Fifteen additional rabbits without treatment for defects were used as control. Histology observation showed the MSCs/PLGA-GCH repair group had better chondrocyte morphology, integration, continuous subchondral bone, and much thicker newly formed cartilage compared with MSCs/PLGA repair group 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively. There was a significant difference in histological grading score between these two groups, which both showed much better repair than control. The present study implied that the hybrid PLGA-GCH scaffold might serve as a new way to keep the differentiation of MSCs for enhancing cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.271065064,Postoperative Evaluation of the Knee after Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation: What Radiologists Need to Know,"Articular cartilage lesions occur commonly. Cartilage is relatively avascular and is unable to self-repair. A chondral lesion may become symptomatic. It may lead to osteoarthritis and increased morbidity. The aim of cartilage repair is to restore hyaline cartilage. There are many types of cartilage repair surgery, most of which result in fibrocartilage repair tissue that is suboptimal. Autologous chondrocyte implantation has been shown to produce hyaline-type repair tissue. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is performed preoperatively to define the ulcer and postoperatively to evaluate the technical success of implantation and the state of cartilage healing and to identify potential complications. Features of the autologous chondrocyte implantation graft that are assessed include the degree of filling by repair tissue, its integration with native cartilage and subchondral bone, the character of the graft substance and surface, and the underlying bone. MR arthrography is superior to unenhanced MR imaging because intraarticular contrast material allows the recipient site to be physically separated from adjacent structures so that it can be characterized more accurately. MR imaging and arthroscopy are complementary investigations in the follow-up of an autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee. The appearance of the knee after autologous chondrocyte implantation varies among individuals and according to the time-course of healing. Familiarity with the surgical procedure and imaging appearance is essential for an accurate postsurgical assessment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20110714-38,Mosaïcplasty,"Management of the patient with symptomatic full-thickness chondral or osteochondral defects of the knee presents a challenging problem for the orthopedic surgeon. The natural history of untreated lesions demonstrates progressive degenerative changes and deterioration in functional outcome scores. Medical management, osteotomies, lavage, and debridement procedures temporize symptoms and slow progression. Cartilage restoration procedures such as microfracture and cell-based therapies have shown promise, but there are concerns of the long-term durability of these procedures in the active population. Mosaicplasty allows for restoration of articular defects with hyaline cartilage, and has shown excellent durability. Articular defect should measure between 1 to 4 cm(2) in diameter and extend 10 mm into subchondral bone. Mosaicplasty can be challenging when attempted arthroscopically, and the threshold to convert to an open procedure should be low when adequate visualization is not achieved. Use of variable graft size maximizes defect fill with hyaline cartilage. Avoidance of graft prominence >1 mm and attention to the contour of the joint optimizes the recreation of articular surface. This is achieved by placing central grafts in a large defect slightly prouder to obtain a convex shape to the articular surface. With attention to the nuances of the surgical technique, mosaicplasty offers an excellent option for cartilage restoration in the young active patient.",0

Two surgical procedures were performed: arthroscopic cartilage biopsy for isolation and expansion of chondrocytes, which were seeded onto collagen membrane and implanted in the lesion site; the characterization of cultured cells and implant was performed using immunofluorescence for type II collagen (COL2) for cell viability and electron microscopy of the implant. Clinical safety, KOOS and IKDC scores and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated. We used repeated-measures ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons at α = 5%.COL2 was identified in the cellular cytoplasm, cell viability was higher than 95% and adequate distribution and cell adhesion were found in the membrane. The median follow-up was 10.9 months (7 to 19). We had two cases of arthrofibrosis, one of graft hypertrophy and one of superficial infection as complications, but none compromising clinical improvement. KOOS and IKDC ranged from 71.2 ± 11.44 and 50.72 ± 14.10, in preoperative period, to 85.0 ± 4.4 and 70.5 ± 8.0, at 6 months (p = 0.007 and 0.005). MRI showed regenerated tissue compatible with hyaline cartilage.ACI in collagen membrane was feasible and safe in a short-term follow-up, presenting regenerated formation visualized by magnetic resonance imaging and improved clinical function.

The autologous chondrocytes implantation (ACI) technique has evolved over the past 20 years: the first-generation technique involves the use of a periosteal patch, the second-generation technique (collagen-cover) uses a type I/III collagen membrane, and the newest third-generation technique seeds and cultivates the collagen membrane with chondrocytes prior to implantation and is referred to as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. Particulated juvenile allograft cartilage (PJAC) (DeNovo NT) is minced cartilage allograft from juvenile donors. A thorough physical exam is important, especially for issues affecting the PF joint, to isolate the location and source of pain, and to identify associated pathologies. Imaging studies allow further characterization of the lesions and identification of associated pathologies and alignment. Conservative management should be exhausted before proceeding with surgical treatment. Steps of surgical treatment are diagnostic arthroscopy and biopsy, chondrocytes culture and chondrocyte implantation for the three generations of ACI, and diagnostic arthroscopy and implantation for PJAC. The techniques and their outcomes will be discussed in this article.",0

The goal of this network meta-analysis was to synthesize these randomized data into a comprehensive model allowing pairwise comparisons of all treatment options and treatment rankings based on multiple measures of efficacy. We hypothesized that advanced chondral procedures would have improved outcomes when compared to microfracture. The MEDLINE, COCHRANE and EMBASE databases were searched systematically up to January 2015. The primary outcome was re-operation measured at 2, 5 and 10 years. Secondary outcomes included Tegner and Lysholm scores, the presence of hyaline cartilage on post-operative biopsy and graft hypertrophy. A random-effects network meta-analysis was performed, and the results are presented as odds ratios and mean differences with 95 % CIs. We ranked the comparative effects of all treatments with surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities. Nineteen RCT from 15 separate cohorts including 855 patients were eligible for inclusion. No differences were seen in re-operation rates at 2 years. At 5 years osteochondral autografts (OC Auto) had a lower re-operation rate than microfracture (OR 0.03, 95 % CI 0.00-0.49), and at 10 years OC Auto had a lower re-operation rate than microfracture (OR 0.34, 95 % CI 0.12-0.92), but a higher re-operation rate than second-generation ACI (OR 5.81, 95 % CI 2.33-14.47). No significant differences in Tegner or Lysholm scores were seen at 2 years. Functional outcome data at 5 and 10 years were not available. Hyaline repair tissue was more common with OC Auto (OR 16.13, 95 % CI 2.80-92.91) and 2nd generation ACI (OR 7.69, 95 % CI 1.17-50) than microfracture, though the clinical significance of this is unknown. Second-generation ACI (OR 0.12, 95 % CI 0.02-0.59) and MACI (OR 0.13, 95 % CI 0.03-0.59) had significantly lower rates of graft hypertrophy than first-generation ACI. Second-generation ACI, OC Auto and MACI were the highest ranked treatments (in order) when all outcome measures were included. Microfracture and advanced cartilage repair techniques have similar re-operation rates and functional outcomes at 2 years. However, advanced repair techniques provide higher-quality repair tissue and might afford lower re-operation rates at 5 and 10 years. Meta-analysis studies, Level I.",0

We studied the repair and regeneration of cartilage damage using layered chondrocyte sheets prepared in a temperature-responsive culture dish. We previously reported achieving robust tissue repair when covering only the surface layer of partial-thickness defects with layered chondrocyte sheets in domestic rabbits. We also reported good Safranin O staining and integration with surrounding tissue in a minipig model of full-thickness cartilaginous defects in the knee joint. We have continued our studies using human chondrocytes obtained from patients under IRB approval, and have confirmed the safety and efficacy of chondrocyte sheets, and have submitted a report to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in Japan. In 2011, the Ministry gave us approval to perform a clinical study of joint repair using cell sheets. We have just started implanting cell sheets in patients at Tokai University Hospital.",0

Biologic augmentation has been increasingly studied as an adjunct in the surgical treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee in animal and human models.The purpose of the study was to systematically review use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) augmentation in the surgical treatment of osteochondral knee defects and to describe the outcomes. It was hypothesized that both PRP and BMC augmentation will result in improved outcomes in osteochondral knee surgery in both animal and human models.Systematic review.PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched for studies relating to PRP or BMC and treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee, from database inception to February 1, 2020. Included were articles that (1) studied PRP or BMC augmentation; (2) used osteochondral autograft, allograft, or biologic scaffold; and (3) treated osteochondral defects in the knee. Data on use of PRP or BMC, outcomes assessed, and results were recorded for each publication.Of the 541 articles identified initially, 17 were included in the final review. Five articles studied osteochondral grafts in animals, 5 studied biologic scaffolds in animals, and 7 studied scaffolds or allografts in humans; the combined sample size was 202 patients. Of 4 histologic scaffold studies, 3 PRP-augmented scaffold studies identified histologic improvements in regenerated cartilage in animal models, while 1 BMC study demonstrated similar improvement in histologic scores of BMC-augmented scaffolds compared with controls. Three studies associated greater collagen type 2 and glycosaminoglycan content with PRP treatment. Comparative studies found that both augments increase osteogenic proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 and osteoprotegerin. Two of 3 studies on BMC-augmented osteochondral allografts reported no difference in radiographic features postoperatively. Long-term improvement in clinical and radiographic outcomes of PRP-augmented scaffolds was demonstrated in 1 human study.Animal studies suggest that biologics possess potential as adjuncts to surgical treatment of osteochondral knee defects; however, clinical data remain limited.",0
https://doi.org/10.1053/j.otsm.2018.06.001,Evaluation of Novel Cartilage Treatment Options for Clinical Use,"Every year there are new cartilage treatments available for clinical use. It is often challenging for the surgeon to choose among a growing menu of treatment options. To ensure appropriate product selection, the surgeon must have a firm understanding of the evolving Food and Drug Administration regulatory pathways, insurance medical policies, and must also be well versed on basic science and clinical evidence in support of the product. Depending on the required Food and Drug Administration pathway, available products range from loosely regulated (animal studies and limited clinical data) to tightly controlled (phased randomized control studies). Challenges and limitations are incumbent with products brought to market through either pathway. Therefore, it is important to develop a personal system to evaluate each novel product—as new is not always better. In this article, we provide the framework for evaluation and integration of novel products into cartilage practice. Through case examples, we highlight pearls and pitfalls in the adoption of new technology from a variety of regulatory pathways. Finally, we provide an overview of existing cartilage treatment options and novel products in the approval “pipeline.”",0

Therefore, in this in vitro study, we evaluated the possible benefit of using minced cartilage embedded in a 3-dimensional culture scaffold and fixed with fibrin glue, in comparison with isolated chondrocytes in atelocollagen, to induce cell migration, proliferation, and matrix production, using cartilage from patients with knee joint osteoarthritis.Cartilage fragments were obtained from 7 female patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and embedded in atelocollagen gels. As a control, chondrocytes were isolated and embedded in gels in the same manner. These composites were cultured for 3 weeks, and cell proliferation and matrix production were evaluated using histology and immunochemistry.Histologically, minced cartilage showed cell migration from the cartilage fragments into the gel, with the Bern score and cell count in the minced cartilage group being significantly higher than those in the control group. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the number of Ki67-positive cells, the expression of LECT-1 and TGF-β, and the glycosaminoglycan content were significantly higher in the minced cartilage than in the control group. Minced cartilage exhibited superior cell migration, proliferation, and glycosaminoglycan content than isolated chondrocytes.Our findings support that minced cartilage has a favorable potential for cell proliferation and matrix production compared with the isolated chondrocytes after enzymatic treatment.",0

American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were evaluated within and between groups preoperatively and at the 3rd, 12th, and 24th month postoperatively. In all patients, magnetic resonance imaging was performed between the 12 and 18th month postoperatively and compared with magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring.Within-group evaluations revealed significant improvements in AOFAS and VAS scores at postoperative 3 and 12 months. The postoperative 24th-month results of AOFAS scores in any group did not differ significantly from the 12th-month results. There was no significant difference between the groups in comparison of AOFAS, VAS, and MOCART scores at any time period.Both scaffolds were found to be effective in cartilage healing but had no clinical or radiologic superiority to each other.

Calibrated rat patellar cartilage defects (1.3 mm) were created at day 0 (D0) and alginate sponge with (Sp/C+) or without (Sp/C-) autologous chondrocytes were implanted. Animals were sacrificed sequentially at D20, D40 and D60 after surgery and dissected patellae underwent MRI exploration (8.5 T). T2 values were calculated from eight SE images by using nonlinear least-squares curve fitting on a pixel-by-pixel basis (constant repetition time of 1.5 s, eight different echo times: 5.5, 7.5, 10.5, 12.5, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0 and 30.0 ms). On the T2 map, acquired in a transversal plane through the repair zone, global T2 values and zonal variation of T2 values of repair tissue were evaluated versus control group and compared with macroscopic score and histological studies (toluidine blue, sirius red and hematoxylin-eosin). “Partial”, “total” and “hypertrophic” repair patterns were identified. At D40 and D60, Sp/C+ group was characterized by a higher proportion of “total” repair in comparison to Sp/C- group. At D60, the proportion of “hypertrophic” repair was two fold in Sp/C- group versus Sp/C+ group. As confirmed morphologically and histologically, the T2 map also permitted the distinction of three types of repair tissue: “total”, “partial” and “hypertrophic”. “Total” repair tissue was characterized by high T2 values versus normal cartilage (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Zonal variation, reflecting the collagen network organization, appeared only at D60 for Sp/C+ group (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). “Hypertrophic” tissue, mainly observed at D60, presented high T2 global values without zonal variation with cartilage depth. These results confirm the potency of the MR T2 map (8.5 T) to characterize macroscopically and microscopically the patterns of the scaffold guided-tissue repair of a focal chondral lesion in the rat patella (”total”, “partial” and “hypertrophic”). On T2 map, three parameters (i.e. MRI macroscopic pattern, T2 global values and zonal variation of T2 values) permit to characterize chondral repair tissue, as a virtual biopsy.",0

An osteochondral defect (diameter, 4 mm; depth, 1 mm) was created on the patellar groove of the femur in both legs. The defects were filled with a chondrocyte-seeded scaffold in the right knee and an empty scaffold in the left knee. Five rabbits each were euthanized at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and their knees were examined via macroscopic inspection, histological and biochemical analysis, and quantitative MRI (T2 mapping and dGEMRIC) to assess the state of tissue repair following allograft chondrocyte implantation with a three-dimensional scaffold for osteochondral lesions.Comparatively good regenerative cartilage was observed both macroscopically and histologically. In both chondrocyte-seeded and control knees, the T2 values of repair tissues were highest at 4 weeks and showed a tendency to decrease with time. ΔR1 values of dGEMRIC also tended to decrease with time in both groups, and the mean ΔR1 was significantly lower in the CS-scaffold group than in the control group at all time points. ΔR1 = 1/r (R1post - R1pre), where r is the relaxivity of Gd-DTPA(2-), R1 = 1/T1 (longitudinal relaxation time).T2 mapping and dGEMRIC were both effective for evaluating tissue repair after allograft chondrocyte implantation. ΔR1 values of dGEMRIC represented good correlation with histologically and biochemically even at early stages after the implantation.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) aims to restore the integrity of isolated cartilage lesions through the induction of hyaline-like cartilage formation. Although ACI has traditionally been used as a second-line treatment, recent evidence suggests that ACI should be considered as a first-line treatment option in certain patients. Recent controlled trials also suggest that there are improved clinical outcomes among those patients who undergo ACI over the mid-term and long-term compared with those treated with microfracture or osteochondral autograft/mosaicplasty, regardless of lesion size. Recent literature also indicates that arthroscopic, second-generation and third-generation techniques are associated with better outcomes and fewer complications than first-generation ACI. In summary, ACI is an effective tool for cartilage restoration that may be more efficacious and durable than other cartilage restoration techniques for appropriate candidates.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23074065,The Use of Autologous Chondrocyte and Mesenchymal Stem Cell Implants for the Treatment of Focal Chondral Defects in Human Knee Joints—A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Focal chondral defects of the knee occur commonly in the young, active population due to trauma. Damage can insidiously spread and lead to osteoarthritis with significant functional and socioeconomic consequences. Implants consisting of autologous chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seeded onto scaffolds have been suggested as promising therapies to restore these defects. However, the degree of integration between the implant and native cartilage still requires optimization. A PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using five databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL) to identify studies that used autologous chondrocyte implants (ACI) or MSC implant therapies to repair chondral defects of the tibiofemoral joint. Data on the integration of the implant-cartilage interface, as well as outcomes of clinical scoring systems, were extracted. Most eligible studies investigated the use of ACI only. Our meta-analysis showed that, across a total of 200 patients, 64% (95% CI (51%, 75%)) achieved complete integration with native cartilage. In addition, a pooled improvement in the mean MOCART integration score was observed during post-operative follow-up (standardized mean difference: 1.16; 95% CI (0.07, 2.24), p = 0.04). All studies showed an improvement in the clinical scores. The use of a collagen-based scaffold was associated with better integration and clinical outcomes. This review demonstrated that cell-seeded scaffolds can achieve good quality integration in most patients, which improves over time and is associated with clinical improvements. A greater number of studies comparing these techniques to traditional cartilage repair methods, with more inclusion of MSC-seeded scaffolds, should allow for a standardized approach to cartilage regeneration to develop.",0
,Up-to-date Review and Cases Report on Chondral Defects of Knee Treated by ACI Technique: Clinical-instrumental and Histological Results.,"The limited regenerative potential of a full thickness defect of the knee joint cartilage has certainly conditioned the development of therapeutic strategies that take into account all the aspects of the healing process. The most common treatments to repair chondral and osteochondral lesions are bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft transplantation, autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. We like to emphasize the difference between a chondral and an osteochondral lesion because the difference is sometimes lost in the literature. In the context of treatment of injuries of the knee joint cartilage, the second-generation autologous chondrocyte transplant is a consolidated surgical method alternative to other techniques. Our experience with the transplantation of chondrocytes has had exceptional clinical results. We report 2 complete cases of a group of 22 in knee and ankle. These 2 cases had histological and instrumental evaluation. We cannot express conclusions, but can only make considerations, stating that, with the clinical functional result being equal, we obtained an excellent macroscopic result in both cases of second look. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a multiple surgical procedure with expensive chondrocyte culture, but even with this limitation, we think that it must be the choice in treating chondral lesions, especially in young patients.",0

The distinction between local cartilage defects and large area degenerative cartilage lesions is very important for both prognosis and surgical therapy. The size and position of the lesion, the underlying pathomechanism and the age of the patient are very important factors which should be considered in the therapy algorithm for optimal cartilage defect restoration. Important cofactors such as stability, long leg axis and muscle balance should be taken into account. Current procedures for cartilage repair of the knee joint and their results are summarized in this article. In addition, the necessity of precise and comprehensive preoperative clinical and radiological diagnostics is displayed to be able to treat co-pathologies in order to enable a successful repair of the cartilage defect. Preoperative planning of cartilage-repair techniques usually includes xaEuroray images and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. If MRI is not available, an arthro-computed tomography could be an alternative. Modern and routinely used procedures for cartilage repair at the knee joint are microfracture, autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral transplantation.

Many novel techniques exist to try and treat this challenging entity. Difficulties associated with treating OCLs include lesion location, size, chronicity, and problems associated with potential graft harvest sites. Matrix-associated stem cell transplantation (MAST) is one such treatment described for larger lesions \textbackslashtextgreater 15 mm(2) or failed alternative therapies. This cohort study describes a 3 year review of the outcomes of talar lesions treated with MAST. Methods A review of all patients treated with MAST by a single surgeon was conducted. Pre-operative radiographs, MRIs, and FAOS outcome questionnaire scores were reviewed. Intraoperative classification was undertaken to correlate with imaging. Post-operative outcomes included FAOS scores, return to sport, revision surgery/failure of treatment, and progression to ankle fusion. Results In this study, 38 OCLs in 32 patients were identified. Median patient age was 35 years of which (68.8%) were male. Median length of follow-up was 36.7 months (range 12-64 months). (83%) returned to playing sport. Twenty-three patients underwent MAST in the setting of a failed previous operative attempt, with just nine having MAST as a first option. Nine patients out of 32 had a further procedure. Improvements were seen in all domains of the FAOS (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Conclusion MAST has demonstrated encouraging results in lesions which prove challenging to treat, even in a “failed microfracture” cohort.",0

The objective of the present study was to compare autologous chondrocyte implantation with microfracture in a randomized trial. We are not aware of any previous randomized studies comparing these methods.Eighty patients without general osteoarthritis who had a single symptomatic cartilage defect on the femoral condyle in a stable knee were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation or microfracture (forty in each group). We used the International Cartilage Repair Society, Lysholm, Short Form-36 (SF-36), and Tegner forms to collect data. An independent observer performed a follow-up examination at twelve and twenty-four months. Two years postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histological evaluation was carried out. The histological evaluation was done by a pathologist and a clinical scientist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment.In general, there were small differences between the two treatment groups. At two years, both groups had significant clinical improvement. According to the SF-36 physical component score at two years postoperatively, the improvement in the microfracture group was significantly better than that in the autologous chondrocyte implantation group (p = 0.004). Younger and more active patients did better in both groups. There were two failures in the autologous chondrocyte implantation group and one in the microfracture group. No serious complications were reported. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 84% of the patients, and histological evaluation of repair tissues showed no significant differences between the two groups. We did not find any association between the histological quality of the tissue and the clinical outcome according to the scores on the Lysholm or SF-36 form or the visual analog scale.Both methods had acceptable short-term clinical results. There was no significant difference in macroscopic or histological results between the two treatment groups and no association between the histological findings and the clinical outcome at the two-year time-point.Therapeutic study, Level I-1a (randomized controlled trial [significant difference]).

An 18-year-old woman who sustained a distal radius fracture remained symptomatic after nonoperative treatment and diagnostic wrist arthroscopy with microfracture. We used a commercial harvesting system to transfer an osteochondral plug into a cartilage defect involving the lunate facet of the distal radius. At final follow-up, 34 months after surgery, the patient was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores and with a comprehensive physical examination. Magnetic resonance arthrogram was used to assess articular cartilage status. VAS pain score improved from 7 before surgery to 0.5 after surgery. Postoperative DASH score was 0. The patient was asymptomatic and had satisfactory wrist motion without mechanical symptoms.

Bone marrow-derived MSCs are pluripotent cells that can differentiate among others into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes.Bone marrow-derived cells may represent the future in osteochondral repair. A one-step arthroscopic technique is developed for cartilage repair, using a device to concentrate bone marrow-derived cells and collagen powder or hyaluronic acid membrane as scaffolds for cell support and platelet gel.The rationale of the ""one-step technique"" is to transplant the entire bone-marrow cellular pool instead of isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells allowing cells to be processed directly in the operating room, without the need for a laboratory phase. For an entirely arthroscopic implantation are employed a scaffold and the instrumentation previously applied for ACI; in addition to these devices, autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is added in order to provide a supplement of growth factors. Results of this technique are encouraging at mid-term although long-term follow-up is still needed.",0

All lesions were Outerbridge grade III or IV with a mean lesion size of 3.30.7cm(2). The mean follow-up time was 24.4 months. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Lysholm knee score, and Tegner activity scale were the instruments to evaluate the clinical status. Magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system was used to analyze the characteristics of repair tissue.ResultsNo significant differences were detected between the groups regarding VAS, Lysholm, and Tegner scores at any time interval during the whole follow-up. The mean post-operative VAS and Lysholm scores at the latest follow-up was significantly better in cases with the lesion size3cm(2) in Group 1 (p=0.001, p\textbackslashtextless0.001, respectively). However, no significant differences according to the lesion size were detected in Group 2 (n.s.). Complete repair with the filling of the defect was achieved in 7 (28%) of the knees in Group 1 and it was 7 (33.3%) of the knees in Group 2 according to MOCART system at the latest follow-up.ConclusionSingle-stage regenerative cartilage surgery using chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood implant combined to microfracture for focal osteochondral lesions of the knee revealed similar clinical and radiographic outcomes with hyaluronic acid-based cell-free scaffold at short-term follow-up. However, clinical outcomes of hyaluronan scaffold were less sensitive to defect size than chitosan. With the advantages of no hypertrophic repair tissue formation as well as no need to arthrotomy during surgery, chitosan is an effective choice especially in patients with the lesion size3cm(2).Level of evidence III.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1672155,Adipose-Based Therapies for Knee Pain—Fat or Fiction,"Abstract Regenerative cell therapies are emerging as promising treatments for numerous musculoskeletal conditions, including knee osteoarthritis (OA). Adipose-derived stem cells and possibly other adipose-based therapies have a greater chondrogenic potential than stem cells derived from bone marrow, and thus a lot of attention is being placed on them as potential regenerative agents in the treatment of knee OA. Several types of adipose-based therapies have good basic science and preclinical data supporting their translation to human therapeutic intervention. Cultured, adipose-derived stem cells appear to be good source of bioactive cells with convenient accessibility, relative abundance, and well-documented regenerative capacity. Non-culture expanded adipose-based therapy, in the forms of stromal vascular fraction and most recently micronized adipose tissue (MAT), have been utilized in patients to treat OA and other cartilage abnormalities with encouraging preliminary data. These adipose-based therapies have shown a lot of therapeutic potential; however, because of the regulatory restrictions on enzymatic isolation and cell expansion, only MAT is currently available in clinical practice in the United States. While no serious adverse reactions have been reported, adipose-derived therapies also have the potential for adverse reactions including inflammation and infection. The current review provides an update on the latest research and presents this evidence on the therapeutic potential of adipose-based therapies in the treatment of knee OA.",0

However, it is not clear whether graft hypertrophy is a complication or an adjustment reaction in the cartilage regeneration after ACI. Purpose: To analyze the cartilage quality of the ACI regeneration with graft hypertrophy using T2-weighted mapping. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 91 patients with isolated cartilage defects (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III-IV) of the knee were treated with Novocart 3D, a third-generation, matrix-based, ACI procedure in the knee joint. All patients were evaluated with a standardized magnetic resonance imaging protocol after 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months postoperatively. For morphological and biochemical assessment, the T2-weighted relaxation times of the ACI grafts as well as the healthy surrounding cartilage were determined. The results of the 20 patients with graft hypertrophy (hypertrophic group) were compared with the results of 21 matched patients without graft hypertrophy (nonhypertrophic group) after ACI. Match-paired analysis was performed by comparison of age, defect size, and body mass index. Results: The T2-weighted relaxation times of the ACI graft showed significant improvement, with values decreasing from 52.1 milliseconds to 33.3 milliseconds after 48 months. After 12 months, the T2-weighted relaxation times were constant and comparable with the healthy surrounding cartilage. Graft hypertrophy was seen in 22% (n = 20) of the patients who underwent ACI. A significant difference in T2-weighted relaxation times between the hypertrophic and nonhypertrophic ACI grafts could not be found except after 36 months (hypertrophic T2-weighted relaxation time/nonhypertrophic T2-weighted relaxation time: 3 months, 48.0/56.4 ms, P = .666; 6 months, 45.6/42.5 ms, P = .280; 12 months, 39.3/34.7 ms, P = .850; 24 months, 34.8/32.2 ms, P = .742; 36 months, 34.6/38.2 ms, P = .030; 48 months, 34.2/32.3 ms, P = .693). Conclusion: The T2-weighted relaxation time of the ACI graft cartilage showed significant improvements over the observation period of 4 years postoperatively. After 2 years, graft maturation was completed. Graft hypertrophy after ACI was seen in 22% of the patients. Reduced cartilage quality could not be found in patients with graft hypertrophy after ACI.",1

Two authors performed the search, 3 authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, and 2 authors extracted the data. Extracted data included cytologic analysis of PRP, study design, and results.Twenty-one studies (12 in vitro, 8 in vivo, one in vitro and in vivo) met the inclusion criteria. The effects of PRP in these studies included increasing chondrocyte and mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, proteoglycan deposition, and type II collagen deposition. PRP was also found to increase the cell viability of chondrocytes and the migration and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and to inhibit the effect of catabolic cytokines. In vivo, PRP was used as an adjunct to concomitant surgical management, including microfracture surgery and implant, scaffold, and graft insertion. Not all studies concluded that PRP has a positive effect on cartilage repair.The current basic science evidence suggests that PRP has several potential effects on cartilage repair and osteoarthritis, and a proof of concept has been established. Well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to extrapolate this evidence to the clinical setting.",0

This report introduces a new product development with one-stage ACI using a Reveille Cartilage Processor (Reveille CP) as well as the assessment of MRI and clinical results at a 1-year follow-up. The report compared cases between a 42-year-old female who underwent ACI surgery using Reveille CP and a 51-year old female who received treatment with two-stage ACI of tissue-engineered cartilage-like tissue (J-TEC Autologous Chondrocyte Cultured Cartilage [JACC]). One year after JACC, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signal intensity area in the grafted area, while patients with Reveille CP showed greater thickness than the surrounding healthy cartilage.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2502-3,An anterior ankle arthroscopic technique for retrograde osteochondral autograft transplantation of posteromedial and central talar dome cartilage defects,"The purpose of this study was to present an arthroscopic technique for the treatment for posteromedial and central cartilage defects of the talus using anterior arthroscopic portals and without performing a medial malleolar osteotomy. Nine fresh cadavers were dissected. Autografts were implanted under arthroscopy using a retrograde osteochondral transplantation system, and their position was estimated using specific angular calibrators and later confirmed by software analysis of two photographs of the disarticulated ankle joint. In eight cases, the congruence between the surrounding articular cartilage and the cartilage of the graft was high, with differences measuring \textbackslashtextless 1 mm. There were no iatrogenic cartilage lesions of the tibial plafond and no fractures of the talus. All the autografts remained stable during full range of motion cycles of the ankle joint. One failure was reported. This cadaveric study showed that the retrograde osteochondral autograft transplantation technique in the talus is feasible. It can be used to restore the posteromedial and central talar articular surfaces using conventional ankle arthroscopic instrumentation and anterior arthroscopic portals without resorting to a medial malleolar osteotomy. Further clinical and biomechanical studies are required to prove the efficacy of this technique and its reproducibility in routine clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.3113/fai.2010.0277,Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus Treated With Fresh Talar Allografts,"Background: Osteochondral lesions of the talar dome (OLT) can be devastating injuries. Many of these problems occur in younger adult patients and can cause permanent joint pain and stiffness. Several treatment methods have been used to treat the symptomatic lesion, including arthroscopic debridement and microfracture, transfer of autologous osteoarticular tissue from the knee or talus (OATS), autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), frozen and fresh allograft transplantation. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients underwent fresh talar allograft transplantation with internal fixation for an OLT. Fresh talar allograft transplantation involved arthrotomy of the ankle, often with malleolar osteotomy, and replacement of the talar dome defect with fresh talar allograft tissue and internal fixation. Thirteen of the 18 patients returned for clinical and radiographic examination in addition to completing two validated questionnaires. The other five patients did not return for followup evaluation. The 13 patients who were seen in followup had an average age of 30 (range, 15 to 44) years with a mean followup of 48 months. Results: There was a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.01) between the patients' preoperative and postoperative pain and activity abilities as measured with the Foot Function Index and AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot questionnaires. Clinical examination and X-rays confirmed healing of the graft. Conclusion: Based on these results, we conclude that this is a reasonable procedure for younger adult patients with focal osteochondral talar defects that cannot be corrected with curretage and microfracture.

In this study, we aim to determine current trends in surgical treatment for OCD lesions in the skeletally immature who have failed 6 months of nonoperative management by surveying a large cohort of orthopaedic surgeons.An electronic survey designed using REDCap to capture surgeon treatment preferences for OCD lesions was distributed to members of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA). The survey inquired about treating physicians' training and demographics. It then offered a series of clinical vignettes alongside imaging describing patients with varying degrees of severity of OCD following nonoperative treatment. Surgeons were prompted to select from a variety of multiple-choice-based options for further patient management. Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize and compare the responses.Of the 129 POSNA members completing the pediatric survey, 97.7% were attending level orthopaedic surgeons, the majority identifying with an academic institution and treating mostly skeletally immature patients. In the skeletally immature population, the majority would treat intact, stable OCD lesions with drilling in a retroarticular or transarticular manner. Preferred treatment for unstable, salvageable lesions was screw fixation using bioabsorble materials or metal with variable pitch with no bone graft. The majority of respondents would treat unstable, unsalvageable OCD lesions with chondroplasty and osteochondral transplant/transfer or microfracture/drilling.The POSNA membership appears to agree on principle in terms of treatment modalities for various stages of OCD lesions in the skeletally immature, whereas individual techniques of achieving these principles may vary. Members endorse drilling for stable intact lesions; fixation for unstable, salvageable lesions; and ""defect fill"" for unsalvageable lesions.OCD surgical treatment patterns can be used in future studies to determine which techniques are most effective for given indications, with the goal of designing a research-proven optimal treatment regimen for skeletally immature patients.",0

Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) containing bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has been suggested as an autologous biologic adjunct to aid long bone healing. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the basic science in vivo evidence for the use of BMAC with BMSCs in the treatment of segmental defects in animal long bones.The PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were screened in July 14-25, 2014.The following search criteria were used: [(""bmac"" OR ""bone marrow aspirate concentrate"" OR ""bmc"" OR ""bone marrow concentrate"" OR ""mesenchymal stem cells"") AND (""bone"" OR ""osteogenesis"" OR ""fracture healing"" OR ""nonunion"" OR ""delayed union"")].Three authors extracted data and analyzed for trends. Quality of evidence score was given to each study.Results are presented as Hedge G standardized effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals.The search yielded 35 articles for inclusion. Of studies reporting statistics, 100% showed significant increase in bone formation in the BMAC group on radiograph. Ninety percent reported significant improvement in earlier bone healing on histologic/histomorphometric assessment. Eighty-one percent reported a significant increase in bone area on micro-computed tomography. Seventy-eight percent showed a higher torsional stiffness for the BMAC-treated defects.In the in vivo studies evaluated, BMAC confer beneficial effects on the healing of segmental defects in animal long bone models when compared with a control.

Osteochondral autograft and allograft reconstruction of these lesions has been used extensively; however, these techniques often require a more invasive surgical exposure, and restoring the natural articular surface radius of curvature can be challenging, particularly in larger lesions. Cell-based repair of these lesions, using autologous chondrocytes in conjunction with bone grafting, has been used with success, although this procedure requires the patient to undergo 2 operations, and access is often restricted due to the high associated costs. Comparable medium-term clinical outcomes have been shown with scaffold-associated mesenchymal stem cell grafting, and this cell-based procedure may also be performed arthroscopically to minimize patient morbidity. In cases of cartilage injury associated with bone loss, this procedure has great potential to repair osteochondral injury when used in conjunction with bone grafting. We present the one-step arthroscopic technique of biologic inlay osteochondral reconstruction in the knee, using an autologous bone graft and a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold embedded with bone marrow aspirate concentrate, to treat full-thickness cartilage lesions associated with significant subchondral bone loss.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-012-2304-9,Current Treatments of Isolated Articular Cartilage Lesions of the Knee Achieve Similar Outcomes,"Many surgical techniques, including microfracture, periosteal and perichondral grafts, chondrocyte transplantation, and osteochondral grafts, have been studied in an attempt to restore damaged articular cartilage. However, there is no consensus regarding the best method to repair isolated articular cartilage defects of the knee.We compared postoperative functional outcomes, followup MRI appearance, and arthroscopic examination after microfracture (MF), osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT), or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI).We prospectively investigated 30 knees with MF, 22 with OAT, and 18 with ACI. Minimum followup was 3 years (mean, 5 years; range, 3-10 years). We included only patients with isolated cartilage defects and without other knee injuries. The three procedures were compared in terms of function using the Lysholm knee evaluation scale, Tegner activity scale, and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score; modified Outerbridge cartilage grades using MRI; and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) repair grade using arthroscopy.All three procedures showed improvement in functional scores. There were no differences in functional scores and postoperative MRI grades among the groups. Arthroscopy at 1 year showed excellent or good results in 80% after MF, 82% after OAT, and 80% after ACI. Our study did not show a clear benefit of either ACI or OAT over MF.Owing to a lack of superiority of any one treatment, we believe MF is a reasonable option as a first-line therapy given its ease and affordability relative to ACI or OAT.Level II, therapeutic study.

https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2015-0192,Human Cartilage-Derived Progenitor Cells From Committed Chondrocytes for Efficient Cartilage Repair and Regeneration,"Abstract Articular cartilage is not a physiologically self-renewing tissue. Injury of cartilage often progresses from the articular surface to the subchondral bone, leading to pathogenesis of tissue degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Therapies to treat cartilage defects using autologous chondrocyte-based tissue engineering have been developed and used for more than 20 years; however, the challenge of chondrocyte expansion in vitro remains. A promising cell source, cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs), has attracted recent attention. Because their origin and identity are still unclear, the application potential of CSPCs is under active investigation. Here we have captured the emergence of a group of stem/progenitor cells derived from adult human chondrocytes, highlighted by dynamic changes in expression of the mature chondrocyte marker, COL2, and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) marker, CD146. These cells are termed chondrocyte-derived progenitor cells (CDPCs). The stem cell-like potency and differentiation status of CDPCs were determined by physical and biochemical cues during culture. A low-density, low-glucose 2-dimensional culture condition (2DLL) was critical for the emergence and proliferation enhancement of CDPCs. CDPCs showed similar phenotype as bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells but exhibited greater chondrogenic potential. Moreover, the 2DLL-cultured CDPCs proved efficient in cartilage formation both in vitro and in vivo and in repairing large knee cartilage defects (6–13 cm2) in 15 patients. These findings suggest a phenotype conversion between chondrocytes and CDPCs and provide conditions that promote the conversion. These insights expand our understanding of cartilage biology and may enhance the success of chondrocyte-based therapies. Significance Injury of cartilage, a non-self-repairing tissue, often progresses to pathogenesis of degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Although tissue-derived stem cells have been shown to contribute to tissue renewal and homeostasis, the derivation, biological function, and application potential of stem/progenitor cells found in adult human articular cartilage are incompletely understood. This study reports the derivation of a population of cartilage stem/progenitor cells from fully differentiated chondrocytes under specific culture conditions, which have the potential to reassume their chondrocytic phenotype for efficient cartilage regeneration. These findings support the possibility of using in vitro amplified chondrocyte-derived progenitor cells for joint cartilage repair.",0

To overcome these limitations, a preshaped, cylindrical sterilized and decellularized osteochondral allograft (SDOCA) implant was recently introduced as a clinical treatment option. Purpose: To evaluate functional outcomes and graft survivorship among patients treated with the SDOCA implant for knee cartilage injuries. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: An institutional review board–approved database was used to identify a series of patients with prospectively collected data who had been treated with the SDOCA implant. The surgeries were performed at 2 centers by 2 surgeons. Patient-reported outcomes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the number and type of reoperations were assessed. Failure was defined as structural damage of the graft diagnosed by arthroscopy or MRI, and any reoperation resulting in removal of the allograft. Patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx Sports Activity Scale. MRI was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: There were 32 patients with a mean age (±SD) of 35.1 ± 10.6 years; 59% were male. Twenty-three (72%) knees had previous surgery. The mean defect area (±SD) was 2.9 ± 2.0 cm 2 , and the mean allograft size was 13.18 ± 2.3 mm (6 grafts ≤9 mm and 59 grafts ≥11 mm). The median number of allografts per knee was 2 (range, 1-5 grafts). Twenty-three of the 32 knees (72%) were considered failures by the definition detailed above. Of these, 14 knees (43%) had further surgery after the index procedure. Implant survivorship was 19.6% at 2 years. The mean follow-up duration was 1.29 years (range, 0.11-2.8 years). KOOS pain, activities of daily living (ADL), sports and recreation (sport/rec), and knee-related quality of life improved significantly from the preoperative visit to latest follow-up. Age was significantly predictive of failure, with a hazard ratio of 1.68 per 1 SD older (95% CI, 1.05-2.68; P = .030). The MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) feature effusion was the only score to correlate with KOOS (symptoms, pain, ADL, sport/rec). Conclusion: The SDOCA implant demonstrated a 72% failure rate within the first 2 years of implantation at these 2 institutions.",0

Design Prospectively collected data from 132 patients (mean age, 41.8 years; 69% male) with isolated chondral or osteochondral femoral defects treated with biphasic synthetic scaffolds ( n = 66) or microfracture ( n = 66) were reviewed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated longitudinally over 5 years with the Short Form–36 (SF-36), Activities of Daily Living of the Knee Outcome Survey (KOS-ADL), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Marx Activity Scale. Cartilage-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate osseous integration and cartilage fill in a subgroup of patients. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of clinical outcomes within the scaffold group. Results Both groups demonstrated clinically significant improvements in knee clinical scores over 5 years ( P &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences in KOS-ADL and IKDC scores between groups up to 5 years postoperatively. Marx activity level scores in the microfracture group declined over time, while significant improvements in activity level scores were observed in the scaffold group over 5 years ( P &lt; 0.01). Good-quality tissue fill and cartilage isointensity were more often observed in the scaffold group compared with the microfracture group, particularly with longer time intervals. Increasing age, high body mass index, prior microfracture, and traumatic etiology were predictors for inferior outcomes in the scaffold group. Conclusions Activity level and MRI appearance following treatment of cartilage lesions with the biphasic synthetic scaffold were superior to microfracture over time in this nonrandomized, retrospective comparison.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-015-2988-z,Clinical outcome and T2 assessment following autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis in osteochondral lesions of the talus,"Purpose Scientific evidence for the treatment of osteochondral lesions (OCLs) of the talus is limited. The aim of this study was an evaluation of the clinical outcome after a one-step autologous subchondral cancellous bone graft and autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) in medial OCLs of the talus and the assessment of the repair tissue (RT). Methods Seventeen patients (eight women, nine men; mean age, 38.8 +/- 15.7 years) with an OCL of the medial talus underwent surgery. Clinical and radiological assessment was performed after a mean follow-up of 39.5 +/- 18.4 months, including established scoring systems (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society [AOFAS] Score, Foot Function Index [FFI], visual analogue scale [VAS]), evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue scoring system (MOCART Score) and T2 mapping. Results Preoperative pain (7.8 +/- 2.1) significantly improved to an average of 3.2 +/- 2.4 postoperatively. AOFAS Score averaged 82.6 +/- 13.4, MOCART Score 52.7 +/- 15.9. Mean T2 relaxation time of the RT was 41.6 +/- 6.3 ms and showed no significant differences to the surrounding cartilage (mean, 38.8 +/- 8.5; p = 0.58). MOCART Score significantly correlated with the AOFAS Score (rho = 0.574, p = 0.040). T2 relaxation time of the RT significantly correlated with the MOCART Score (rho = 0.593, p = 0.033). Conclusions The one-step autologous subchondral cancellous bone grafting and AMIC leads to a significant reduction in postoperative pain and satisfying postoperative functional outcome in mid-term follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment demonstrated a good quality of regenerative tissue similar to the MRI ultrastructure of the surrounding cartilage.",0

Purpose: To investigate the longer term clinical and radiological outcomes after an 8-week (vs 12-week) WB protocol after MACI. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A randomized study design allocated 70 patients to an 8- (n = 34) or 12-week (n = 36) approach to full WB after MACI of the medial or lateral femoral condyle. Patients were evaluated preoperatively; at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery; and at 5 and 10 years after surgery. At 10 years (range, 10.5-11.5 years), 60 patients (85.7%; 8 weeks: n = 29; 12 weeks: n = 31) were available for review. Clinical outcomes included patient-reported outcomes, maximal isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength, and functional hop capacity. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken to assess the quality and quantity of repair tissue per the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) system. A combined MRI composite score was also evaluated. Results: Clinical and MRI-based scores for the full cohort significantly improved ( P &lt; .05) over the 10-year period. Apart from the Tegner activity score, which improved ( P = .041), as well as tissue structure ( P = .030), which deteriorated, there were no further statistically significant changes ( P &gt; .05) from 5 to 10 years. There were no 10-year differences between the 2 WB rehabilitation groups. At 10 years, 81.5% and 82.8% of patients in the 8- and 12-week groups, respectively, demonstrated good-excellent tissue infill. Graft failure was observed on MRI at 10 years in 7 patients overall, which included 4 located on 10-year MRI (8 weeks: n = 1; 12 weeks: n = 3) and a further 3 patients (8 weeks: n = 1; 12 weeks: n = 2) not included in the current analysis who proceeded to total knee arthroplasty. At 10 years, 93.3% of patients were satisfied with MACI for relieving their pain, with 83.3% satisfied with their ability to participate in sport. Conclusion: MACI provided high satisfaction levels and tissue durability beyond 10 years. The outcomes of this randomized trial demonstrate a safe 8-week WB rehabilitation protocol without jeopardizing longer term outcomes.",0

Meniscus tissue engineering solution is one option to improve outcomes and relieve pain. In an attempt to fabricate knee meniscus grafts three layered wedge shaped silk meniscal scaffold system was engineered to mimic native meniscus architecture. The scaffolds were seeded with human fibroblasts (outside) and chondrocytes (inside) in a spatial separated mode similar to native tissue, in order to generate meniscus-like tissue in vitro. In chondrogenic culture in the presence of TGF-b3, cell-seeded constructs increased in cellularity and extracellular matrix (ECM) content. Histology and Immunohistochemistry confirmed maintenance of chondrocytic phenotype with higher levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and collagen types I and II. Improved scaffold mechanical properties along with ECM alignment with time in culture suggest this multiporous silk construct as a useful micro-patterned template for directed tissue growth with respect to form and function of meniscus-like tissue.",0

In this study, we assessed mid-term efficacy and safety of gel-based ACI or autologous adult live cultured chondrocytes (CARTIGROW®) implantation in patients with cartilage defects of the knee joint.In this prospective, open-label study, patients (19-38 years) with focal, international cartilage repair society grade III or IV articular cartilage defects of the knee joint were enroled at four centres across India from April 2015 to September 2015. Punch biopsy was conducted to harvest cartilage, from which chondrocytes were isolated and cultured, and the characterised chondrocytes were implanted into the cartilage defect. Key efficacy outcomes were assessed by quantitative changes in international knee documentation committee (IKDC), visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, and qualitative changes in magnetic resonance imaging at six months and four years from baseline.Of the14 patients enroled in the study, all patients completed the six month follow-up and 11 completed the four year follow-up. The IKDC score improved significantly from 32.84 ± 9.25 at baseline to 67.49 ± 13.03 at six months (mean difference [MD] 34.66 ± 13.00, p < 0.0001) and to 60.18 ± 10.33 at four years (MD 28.21 ± 15.14, p = 0.0001). The VAS score reduced from 72.00 ± 14.40 at baseline to 16.64 ± 17.03 at six months (MD 55.36 ± 24.50, p < 0.0001) and further to 12.72 ± 9.05 at four years (MD 62.09 ± 10.66, p < 0.0001). All patients showed improvement on MRI of the knee joint. No adverse events were reported.Autologous adult live cultured chondrocytes (CARTIGROW®) implantation showed good mid-term efficacy in patients with cartilage defects of the knee joint with no side-effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2006.02.011,"A prospective, ranomised study comparing two techniques of autologous chondrocyte implantation for osteochondral defects in the knee: Periosteum covered versus type I/III collagen covered","<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Introduction</h3> The results for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in the treatment of full thickness chondral defects in the knee are encouraging. At present two techniques have been described to retain the chondrocyte suspension within the defect. The first involves using a periosteal cover (ACI-P) and the second involves using a type I/III collagen membrane (ACI-C). To the authors knowledge there are no comparative studies of these two techniques in the current literature. We have therefore undertaken such a study to establish if there is a difference between the 2 techniques based on a clinical and arthroscopic assessment. <h3>Methods</h3> A total of 68 patients with a mean age of 30.52years with symptomatic articular cartilage defects were randomised to have either ACI-P (33 patients) or ACI-C (35 patients). The mean defect size was 4.54cm<sup>2</sup>. All patients were followed up at 24months. <h3>Results</h3> A clinical and functional assessment showed that 74% of patients had a good or excellent result following the ACI-C compared with 67% after the ACI-P at 2years. Arthroscopy at 1year also demonstrated similar results for both techniques. However, 36.4% of the ACI-P grafts required shaving for hypertrophy compared with none for the ACI-C grafts at 1year. <h3>Discussion</h3> This study has shown no statistical difference between the clinical outcome of ACI-C versus ACI-P at 2years. A significant number of patients who had the ACI-P required shaving of a hypertrophied graft. We conclude that there is no advantage in using periosteum as a cover for retaining chondrocytes within an osteochondral defect; as a result we advocate the use of an alternative cover such as a manufactured type I/III collagen membrane.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603515574839,The Challenge and the Promise of Bone Marrow Cells for Human Cartilage Repair,"The cartilage repair potential of bone marrow–derived stem cells has been well described. Harnessing this potential for human articular cartilage repair remains challenging. Accessing bone marrow repair cells through marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture is readily achieved with generally good but inconsistent results. Animal and human studies show feasibility for ex vivo processing of bone marrow to isolate, concentrate, and culture mesenchymal stem cells. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement using bone marrow cell preparations above what has been achieved with microfracture. Consequently, microfracture continues to be the simplest and most commonly used method to enhance repair of focal articular cartilage defects. Emerging preclinical work in the equine model suggests a role for enhancing marrow-stimulation techniques through the use of natural scaffolds such as autologous platelet enriched fibrin as well as optimization of joint biology through localized gene therapy to support cartilage repair. In contrast to joint replacement where inert materials of known mechanical properties are used, host biology determines the relative success, failure, and durability of cartilage repair. As such, development of personalized strategies to improve the quality and durability of bone marrow cell–based articular cartilage repair represent exciting new areas of inquiry. Continued advances in stem cell biology, scaffold technologies, and methods to delineate and enhance host biology, both systemically and within the joint, hold promise for harnessing the full power of bone marrow cells to facilitate cartilage repair and regeneration.",0

After a mean follow-up period of 3.7 years (range 32-80 months), pre- and postoperative clinical and functional evaluations of the patients were performed using Visual Pain Scale (VPS), Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, and Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale. Wilcoxon test was used for statistical evaluation of pre- and postoperative outcomes. Improvement of the lesions was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at year 1 postoperatively at the earliest.The mean lesion size was 1.32 cm2 (range 0.8-1.8 cm2). The mean pre- and postoperative VPS values were calculated to be 75.5 ± 12.32 (range 46-92) and 17.57 ± 10.21 (range 0-40), respectively ( p < 0.01). The mean pre- and postoperative Lysholm knee scores were 44.57 ± 9.35 (range 26-65) and 80 ± 6.9 (range 70-94), respectively ( p < 0.01), and the mean pre- and postoperative Kujala anterior knee pain scores were 48.21 ± 7.78 (range 38-68) and 78.42 ± 7.06 (range 70-96), respectively ( p < 0.01). MRI taken at year 1 postoperatively showed that the autograft bone tissue was sufficiently incorporated into the recipient site in all patients; an even articular surface was formed, but the thickness of the cartilage tissue was mostly uneven between the adjacency of the recipient site and the autograft, which caused no negative effect on clinical and functional outcomes.Despite the difference in thickness of the cartilage tissue between the recipient and the donor site, the AOT technique for the treatment of patellar osteochondral lesions resolves the symptoms of the patient and ensures an apparent functional and clinical improvement even if an articular surface could be created.",0
https://doi.org/10.4081/or.2013.e26,Feasibility of arthroscopic placement of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis grafts in the cadaver hip joint,"An assortment of clinical trials have been done presenting the effectiveness of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) for the regeneration of chondral leasions. The purpose of the study was to underline the accessability of the acetabulum and the femoral head through the known portals and prove i) the feasibility of placing the AMIC in the different zones of the hip joint and ii) check for dislocation after joint movement. Six human cadavers underwent hip arthroscopy on both hips. Two chondral lesions were set on each femoral head and two in the acetabulum to evaluate a total of 48 defects. After microfracturing an autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis graft was placed on these lesions arthroscopically. After repeated joint movement the dislocation of the graft was checked. It was possible to place the AMIC graft in all 48 chondral lesions. The time needed for placing the graft was 8±2.9 minutes. A trend of time reduction could be detected throughout this study as the surgeon gained more experience. For the femoral head, after twenty cycles of joint movement 18/24 spots showed no displacement, 4/24 showed minor displacement (<3 mm) and 2/24 showed major displacement (>3 mm). None showed total displacement. For the acetabulum 22/24 spots showed no displacement and 2/24 showed minor displacement. A combined microfracturing and placing of an AMIC graft of focal chondral lesions of the hip joint can be done arthroscopically. Prospective randomized in vivo studies should compare the results of arthroscopilally placed AMIC grafts with microfracturing and microfracturing alone.",0

Postoperatively, the time required to attain full weightbearing (WB) remains conservative. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that patients would have no significant clinical or radiological differences or graft complications after an 8-week or 6-week return to full WB after MACI. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 37 knees (n = 35 patients) were randomly allocated to either an 8-week return to full WB that we considered current best practice based on the existing literature (CR group; n = 19 knees) or an accelerated 6-week WB approach (AR group; n = 18 knees). Patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery, using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, visual analog pain scale, 6-minute walk test, and active knee range of motion. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to assess peak knee extension and flexion strength and limb symmetry indices (LSIs) between the operated and nonoperated limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken to evaluate the quality and quantity of repair tissue as well as to calculate an MRI composite score. Results: Significant improvements ( P &lt; .05) were observed in all subjective scores, active knee flexion and extension, 6-minute capacity, peak knee extensor torque in the operated limb, and knee extensor LSI, although no group differences existed. Although knee flexor LSIs were above 100% for both groups at 12 and 24 months after surgery, LSIs for knee extensor torque at 24 months were 93.7% and 87.5% for the AR and CR groups, respectively. The MRI composite score and pertinent graft parameters significantly improved over time ( P &lt; .05), with some superior in the AR group at 24 months. All patients in the AR group (100%) demonstrated good to excellent infill at 24 months, compared with 83% of patients in the CR group. Two cases of graft failure were observed, both in the CR group. At 24 months, 83% of patients in the CR group and 88% in the AR group were satisfied with the results of their MACI surgery. Conclusion: Patients in the AR group who reduced the length of time spent ambulating on crutches produced comparable outcomes up to 24 months, without compromising graft integrity.",1

The chemical, mechanical, and rheological properties of the hydrogel/microparticle were investigated. For in vitro evaluation, the adipose-derived stem cells might be mixed with hydrogel/microparticles, then cellular viability was analyzed by acridine orange/propidium iodide and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and also dimethylmethylene blue assay were conducted to find the amount of proteoglycan. The real-time polymerase chain reaction for aggrecan, sex-determining region Y-Box 9, collagen I (COL1), and COL2 gene expression was performed after 14 and 21 days. For evaluation of cartilage regeneration, the samples were implanted in rabbit knees with cartilaginous experimental defects. Defects were created in both knees of three groups of rabbits. Group 1 was the control with no injection, and Groups 2 and 3 were loaded with hydrogel/cell and hydrogel/microparticle/cell; respectively. Then, after 3 and 6 months, histological evaluations of the defected sites were carried out. The amount of glycosaminoglycans after 14 and 21 days increased significantly in hydrogels/microparticles loaded with cells. The expression of marker genes was also significant in hydrogels/microparticles loaded with cells. According to histology analysis, the hydrogels/microparticles loaded with cells showed the best cartilage regeneration. Overall, our study revealed that the developed injectable hydrogel/microparticle can be used for cartilage regeneration.",0

We present outcome from a prospective cohort study of 61 patients with both trochleal and condylar lesions treated with the HemiCAP(A (R)) implant. From 2007 to 2012, 61 patients were treated with femoral resurfacing using the HemiCAP implant. There were 36 femoral condyle implants and 25 trochleal implants. Indication for treatment with HemiCAP implant was symptomatic cartilage lesion at the femoral condyle demonstrated by MRI or arthroscopy, which was ICRS grade 3-4 and size less than 4 cm(2). There were 24 males and 37 females with a median age of 49 (range 35-65) years. Patients were followed for 2 years with Knee Society subjective outcome scores (KSS), pain scores and radiographic evaluations and for 7 years with complications and reoperations. At 2-year follow-up, mean KSS was improved from 52 (6.2) to 90 (7.9), mean KSS function score was improved from 45 (7.5) to 92 (8.3), and mean Pain score improved from 7.1 (0.7) to 1.8 (1.7). Twenty-three per cent of implants were revised within 7 years to arthroplasty due to progression of cartilage lesions, progression of osteoarthritis, or increased knee pain. No difference between females and males was found for reoperation rate. The present study demonstrated improved subjective outcome and reduced pain after femoral resurfacing using the HemiCAP implant in a relatively large cohort of patients with symptomatic cartilage lesions. A concerning 23 % reoperation rate with conversion to arthroplasty was found. Femoral resurfacing implantation treatment can be a temporary treatment for cartilage lesions expected to develop into osteoarthritis and for younger patients not eligible for arthroplasty treatment.

Various approaches have been proposed to treat these lesions; nevertheless, opinions on indications and clinical efficacy of these techniques are still controversial.To evaluate the outcome of osteochondral autografts for treatment of femoral condyle cartilage lesions at a medium-to long-term follow-up.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.We prospectively evaluated 30 patients (mean age, 29.3 years) with full-thickness knee chondral lesions (<2.5 cm(2)) treated with arthroscopic autologous osteochondral transplantation. Thirteen patients underwent previous surgery, while 17 patients were operated on for the first time. In 19 patients, associated procedures were performed. All patients were evaluated at 2- and 7-year follow-up. The International Cartilage Repair Society form, Tegner score, and magnetic resonance imaging were used for clinical evaluation.The International Cartilage Repair Society objective evaluation showed 76.7% of patients had good or excellent results at 7-year follow-up, and International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score significantly improved from preoperative (34.8) to 7-year follow-up (71.8). The Tegner evaluation showed a significant improvement after the surgery at 2- and 7-year follow-up (from 2.9 to 6.2 and 5.6, respectively); however, we noticed reduced sports activity from 2- to 7-year follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation showed good integration of the graft in the host bone and complete maintenance of the grafted cartilage in more than 60% of cases.The results of this technique at medium- to long-term follow-up are encouraging. This arthroscopic 1-step surgery appears to be a valid solution for treatment of small, grade III to IV cartilage defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.20530,Cartilage repair with osteochondral autografts in sheep: Effect of biophysical stimulation with pulsed electromagnetic fields,"The effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on the integration of osteochondral autografts was evaluated in sheep. After osteochondral grafts were performed, the animals were treated with PEMFs for 6 h/day or sham-treated. Six animals were sacrificed at 1 month. Fourteen animals were treated for 2 months and sacrificed at 6 months. At 1 month, the osteogenic activity at the transplant-host subchondral bone interface was increased in PEMF-treated animals compared to controls. Articular cartilage was healthy in controls and stimulated animals. At 6 months, complete resorption was observed in four control grafts only. Cyst-like resorption areas were more frequent within the graft of sham-treated animals versus PEMF-treated. The average volume of the cysts was not significantly different between the two groups; nevertheless, analysis of the variance of the volumes demonstrated a significant difference. The histological score showed no significant differences between controls and stimulated animals, but the percentage of surface covered by fibrous tissue was higher in the control group than in the stimulated one. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration in the synovial fluid was significantly lower, and transforming growth factor-beta1 was significantly higher, in PEMF-treated animals compared to controls. One month after osteochondral graft implantation, we observed larger bone formation in PEMF-treated grafts which favors early graft stabilization. In the long term, PEMF exposure limited the bone resorption in subchondral bone; furthermore, the cytokine profile in the synovial fluid was indicative of a more favorable articular environment for the graft.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/17453674.2014.958807,Improved quality of cartilage repair by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of an osteochondral defect in a cynomolgus macaque model,"Integration of repaired cartilage with surrounding native cartilage is a major challenge for successful tissue-engineering strategies of cartilage repair. We investigated whether incorporation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the collagen scaffold improves integration and repair of cartilage defects in a cynomolgus macaque model.Cynomolgus macaque bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated and incorporated into type-I collagen gel. Full-thickness osteochondral defects (3 mm in diameter, 5 mm in depth) were created in the patellar groove of 36 knees of 18 macaques and were either left untreated (null group, n = 12), had collagen gel alone inserted (gel group, n = 12), or had collagen gel incorporating MSCs inserted (MSC group, n = 12). After 6, 12, and 24 weeks, the cartilage integration and tissue response were evaluated macroscopically and histologically (4 null, 4 gel, and 4 MSC knees at each time point).The gel group showed most cartilage-rich reparative tissue covering the defect, owing to formation of excessive cartilage extruding though the insufficient subchondral bone. Despite the fact that a lower amount of new cartilage was produced, the MSC group had better-quality cartilage with regular surface, seamless integration with neighboring naïve cartilage, and reconstruction of trabecular subchondral bone.Even with intensive investigation, MSC-based cell therapy has not yet been established in experimental cartilage repair. Our model using cynomolgus macaques had optimized conditions, and the method using MSCs is superior to other experimental settings, allowing the possibility that the procedure might be introduced to future clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0278-5919(05)70309-4,TREATMENT ALGORITHM FOR OSTEOCHONDRAL INJURIES OF THE KNEE,"The treatment of osteochondral fractures and OCD lesions in the knee is controversial. Many new procedures and techniques have been developed recently to address osteochondral lesions, indicating that no single procedure is accepted universally. Our treatment algorithm is based on the age of the patient, skeletal maturity, and the presence of adequate subchondral bone attached to the chondral lesion. Most nondisplaced lesions in the patient with open physes will heal with conservative treatment. The onset of skeletal maturity indicates a need for a more aggressive treatment approach. If adequate cortical bone is attached to the fragment, drilling of stable lesions, or drilling with fixation of unstable or loose fragments is appropriate. Autologous bone graft can be necessary to stimulate healing and properly reconstruct the subchondral bony contour. For failed fixation attempts or lesions not amenable to fixation, each treating surgeon must be proficient and comfortable with an articular surface reconstruction technique. The goal for the reconstructive procedure, to produce a smooth gliding articular surface of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage, is possible using current techniques including mosaicplasty, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Débridement, drilling, microfracture, and abrasion chondroplasty have been shown to result in fibrocartilage with inferior mechanical properties when compared with hyaline cartilage. No long-term studies have been published, however, to confirm the benefits of replacing osteochondral defects with hyaline cartilage rather than fibrocartilage. Although the results of many reconstructive procedures are quite encouraging with early follow up, the ultimate goal is to prevent long-term degenerative arthritis. Only well-designed prospective studies with long-term follow up will determine the adequacy of these procedures in reaching the ultimate goal. This treatment algorithm is based on the senior author's (WGC) experience with the complex dilemma of osteochondral lesions of the knee.",0

While matrix-guided autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) represents a successful treatment for chondral defects, the treatment potential in combination with bone grafting by cancellous bone or bone block augmentation for large and deep osteochondral defects has not been evaluated. Purpose: To evaluate 1- to 3-year clinical outcomes and radiological results on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the treatment of large osteochondral defects of the knee with bone augmentation and MACT. Special emphasis is placed on different methods of bone grafting (cancellous bone grafting or bone block augmentation). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Fifty-one patients were included. Five patients were lost to follow-up. This left 46 patients (mean age, 28.2 years) with a median follow-up time of 2 years. The 46 patients had 47 deep, large osteochondral defects of the knee joint (1 patient with bilateral defects; mean defect size, 6.7 cm 2 ). The origin of the osteochondral defects was osteochondritis dissecans (n = 34), osteonecrosis (n = 8), or subchondral cysts (n = 5). Depending on the depth, all defects were treated by cancellous bone grafting (defect depth ≤10 mm; n = 16) or bone block augmentation (defect depth &gt;10 mm; n = 31) combined with MACT. Clinical outcomes were followed at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years and evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Cincinnati score. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was performed at 1 and 2 years, and the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score with additional specific subchondral bone parameters (bone regeneration, bone signal quality, osteophytes, sclerotic areas, and edema) was analyzed. Results: The clinical outcome scores revealed a significant increase at follow-up (6 months to 3 years) compared with the preclinical results. The median IKDC score increased from 42.6 preoperatively to 75.3 at 1 year, 79.7 at 2 years, and 84.3 at 3 years. The median Cincinnati score significantly increased from 39.8 preoperatively to 72.0 at 1 year, 78.0 at 2 years, and 80.3 at 3 years. The MRI evaluation revealed a MOCART score of 82.6 at 1 year without a deterioration at the later follow-up time point. Especially, the subchondral bone analysis showed successful regeneration. All bone blocks and cancellous bone grafts were integrated in the bony defects, and no chondrocyte transplant failure could be detected throughout the follow-up. Conclusion: Large and deep osteochondral defects of the knee joint can be treated successfully with bone augmentation and MACT. The treatment of shallow bony defects with cancellous bone grafting and deep bony defects with bone block augmentation shows promising results.",0

Aim of this first clinical trial is to prospectively evaluate the results obtained in a group of patients meeting the inclusion criteria of ""EOA"" as proposed by the ESSKA Cartilage Committee, and surgically treated with the implantation of a multi-phasic osteochondral scaffold.23 patients were prospectively evaluated at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. Etiology of the chondral or osteochondral defect was rated as microtraumatic or degenerative in 18 cases, and traumatic in 5 cases. Patients included were complaining of clinical symptoms like knee pain and affected by chondral and osteochondral lesions located at the femoral condyles or trochlea and MRI findings demonstrating articular cartilage degeneration and/or meniscal degeneration and/or subchondral bone marrow lesions.All patients increased significantly in any clinical score adopted. The IKDC subjective score increased from 42.8 ± 13.8 at basal evaluation to 74.3 ± 17.4 at 12 months' (p < 0.0005), being stable (74.9 ± 20.4) up to the final follow-up of 24 months. Tegner score showed a statistically significant improvement in sports activity from 3.3 ± 2.7 pre-operative to 4.6 ± 2.2 at 12 months (p < 0.005), with a slight improvement to the final evaluation (4.7 ± 2.1; n.s.). However, the activity level was significantly lower than the pre-injury one (6.1 ± 2.6; p = 0.004). A significant difference was shown between patients younger versus older than 40 years, with younger patients had better clinical improvement (76.0 ± 18.6 vs 45.1 ± 38.8 respectively, p = 0.037).The implantation of a multi-phasic osteochondral scaffold represents a good option after failure of conservative management for Early OA patients, where younger age represent an important factor for a better outcome. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the benefit over time.IV, case series.",0

This study assessed the effectiveness of autologous bone-marrow stromal cells, which were embedded within a collagen scaffold, to repair a full-thickness articular cartilage defect in the medial femoral condyle of an athlete.A 31-year-old male judo player suffering from pain in the right knee was reviewed. A 20 x 30-mm full-thickness cartilage defect (International Cartilage Repair Society classification (ICRS) grade IV) was revealed in the weight-bearing area of the medial femoral condyle. With the informed consent of the patient, the defect was treated with autologous bone-marrow stromal cells. Bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest of the patient 4 weeks before surgery. After removing the erythrocytes, the remaining cells were expanded in culture. Adherent cells were collected and embedded within a collagen gel, which was transferred to the articular cartilage defect in the medial femoral condyle. The implant was covered with an autologous periosteal flap.Seven months after surgery, arthroscopy revealed the defect to be covered with smooth tissues. Histologically, the defect was filled with a hyaline-like type of cartilage tissue which stained positively with Safranin-O. One year after surgery, the clinical symptoms had improved significantly. The patient had reattained his previous activity level and experienced neither pain nor other complications.Our findings indicate that the transplantation of autologous bone-marrow stromal cells can promote the repair of large focal articular cartilage defects in young, active patients.",0

Methods: Twenty-seven patients (mean age 35 years; range, 20 to 48 years) were randomized to osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT, n=14) or a microfracture (MF, n=13) procedure together with ACL reconstruction in the same session for symptomatic lesions of the articular cartilage in ACL-deficient knees. The mean follow-up period was 34 months (range 24 to 53 months) in the OAT group, and 49 months (range 24 to 97 months) in the MF group. Patients were evaluated using the Lysholm and IKDC 2000 (International Knee Documentation Committee) scores. Results: Patients undergoing OAT had a mean IKDC 2000 score of 49.2 (range 30.1 to 64.7), and Lysholm score of 43.4 (range 33.2 to 58.9) preoperatively. At the end of follow-up, these scores increased to 93.3 (range 73 to 98) and 97.5 (range 38.7 to 100), respectively. In the MF group, the mean IKDC 2000 score increased from 53.6 (range 47.1 to 64.7) to 72.3 (range 62.8 to 94), and the mean Lysholm score increased from 48 (range 38.2 to 58.9) to 81.3 (range 72.7 to 100).

A systematic review of 5-year follow-up data,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and microfracture are two of the main surgical treatment options for articular cartilage lesions of the knee. Consensus regarding the best clinical options to repair knee cartilage lesions is lacking. We undertook a systematic review to clarify the clinical efficacy of ACI and microfracture at minimum mean 5-year follow-up.A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases up to August 2018. Only comparative clinical studies of ACI and microfracture for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions of the knee with level I/Ⅱ evidence were included. Clinical outcomes and the prevalence of treatment failure from each study were extracted and compared. The methodological quality of the included studies was analyzed by means of the PEDro scale.Five comparative studies (three randomized controlled trials and two prospective cohort studies) met our eligibility criteria. ACI and microfracture elicited significant improvement in clinical outcomes after 5 years. However, better clinical results with significant differences were found with modified versions of ACI (ACI with a modified collagen membrane [ACI-C] or matrix-applied chondrocyte implantation [MACI]) than with microfracture as determined by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, activities of daily living assessment, Tegner Activity Scale score, and the International Knee Documentation Committee objective and subjective scores. No significant difference was observed in the treatment failure rate between these two methods within a particular study.Currently, the best-available evidence suggests that some clinical outcomes of articular cartilage lesions of the knee treated with modified versions of ACI (ACI-C or MACI) can significantly improve patient outcomes at the mid-term follow-up of 5 years compared with those obtained using microfracture.",0

Characterized chondrocyte implantation uses an autologous cartilage cell therapy product that has been optimized for its biological potency to form stable cartilage tissue in vivo. Purpose To determine whether, in symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle, structural regeneration with characterized chondrocyte implantation is superior to repair with microfracture. Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods Characterized chondrocyte implantation was compared with microfracture in patients with single grade III to IV symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyles in a multicenter trial. Patients aged 18 to 50 years were randomized to characterized chondrocyte implantation (n = 57) or microfracture (n = 61). Structural repair was blindly assessed in biopsy specimens taken at 1 year using (1) computerized histomorphometry and (2) evaluation of overall histological components of structural repair. Clinical outcome was measured using the self administered Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. Results Characterized chondrocyte implantation resulted in better structural repair, as assessed by histomorphometry ( P = .003) and overall histologic evaluation ( P = .012). Aspects of structural repair relating to chondrocyte phenotype and tissue structure were superior with characterized chondrocyte implantation. Clinical outcome as measured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score at 12 to 18 months after characterized chondrocyte implantation was comparable with microfracture at this stage. Both treatment groups had a similar mean baseline overall Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (56.30 ± 13.61 and 59.53 ± 14.95 for microfracture and characterized chondrocyte implantation, respectively), which increased in both groups to 70.56 ± 12.39 and 72.63 ± 15.55 at 6 months, 73.26 ± 14.66 and 73.10 ± 16.01 at 12 months, and 74.73 ± 17.01 and 75.04 ± 14.50 at 18 months, respectively. Both techniques were generally well tolerated; the incidence of adverse events after characterized chondrocyte implantation was not markedly increased compared with that for microfracture. Conclusion One year after treatment, characterized chondrocyte implantation was associated with a tissue regenerate that was superior to that after microfracture. Short-term clinical outcome was similar for both treatments. The superior structural outcome may result in improved long-term clinical benefit with characterized chondrocyte implantation. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm these findings.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2019.08.021,How to Manage Cartilage Injuries?,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Although small cartilage injuries are commonly found in knee arthroscopy procedures, significant chondral and osteochondral injuries are relatively infrequent. Incidence of cartilage injury rises when considering traumatic origin, especially when approaching significant ligamentous or meniscal pathology. Options for restoration span the gamut from benign neglect to open procedures that restore both cartilage and subchondral bone. The best choice of procedure largely depends on lesion size, depth, and location. Smaller lesions isolated to cartilage <2 cm<sup>2</sup> can be treated with marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture with or without biologic options (bone marrow aspirate concentrate or platelet-rich plasma with or without cartilage precursors or scaffolds). Microfracture alone in larger lesions has been reported to be less durable and it is therefore not recommended for larger lesions. Smaller lesions <2 cm<sup>2</sup> that include a subchondral injury can be treated with osteochondral autograft implantation, in which a core of cartilage and bone is transferred from a relative non-weightbearing surface to the lesion. Larger osteochondral lesions >2 cm<sup>2</sup> are better treated with osteochondral allograft transplantation, where osteochondral cores from a size-matched, fresh cadaver are matched to the patient's lesion. This option may require multiple cores to be placed in a ""snowman"" pattern; however, recent literature demonstrated that a single plug might produce better outcomes. Alternatively, for large chondral-only lesions, a resurfacing procedure may be chosen that may include biologic options. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), currently in its third iteration (matrix ACI [MACI]), is an excellent choice with good long-term durability. In addition, MACI may be used for chondral lesions in the patellofemoral joint where matching the native joint topology may be more difficult. If the patient has an underlying bone marrow lesion but an intact cartilage cap that appears healthy on arthroscopic examination, one may consider a core decompression and injection with biologics such as BMAC and bony scaffold with fibrin glue (also known as <i>bioplasty</i>). It is also critical that the surgeon address any concomitant knee pathology that would compromise cartilage restoration. This includes addressing malalignment with distal femoral, proximal tibial, or tibial tubercle osteotomy, significant meniscal deficiency with meniscal transplant, and any instability from lack of cruciate or collateral ligaments with ligament reconstruction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2018.08.033,A Scaffold-Free Allogeneic Construct From Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Regenerates an Osteochondral Defect in a Rabbit Model,"To determine whether an osteochondral defect could be healed histologically by implanting allogeneic 3-dimensionally formed adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in a rabbit model.Thirty Japanese white rabbits (aged 15-17 weeks) were assigned to 1 of 2 groups. An osteochondral defect (diameter, 4.8 mm; depth, 3 mm) was created in the trochlear groove of the knee using a drill. The defects were left empty in the control group and were filled with cylindrical plugs of allogeneic ADSCs extracted from adipose tissue in the experimental group. Macroscopic scoring, histologic scoring, and immunohistologic stainability of type II collagen were evaluated at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively.The macroscopic scores of the healing tissue in the experimental group were significantly greater than those in the control group at 12 weeks (P = .031). Histologically, safranin O staining was noted at 4 weeks and increased gradually over time in the experimental group. The modified International Cartilage Repair Society histologic score in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the controls at 8 and 12 weeks (14 vs 9 at 8 weeks [P = .008], 18 vs 10 at 12 weeks [P = .007]). The implanted tissue was positive for type II collagen, and stainability increased gradually over time.The 3-dimensional scaffold-free allogeneic ADSCs implanted into the osteochondral defect survived, adhered to the defect, increased the stainability of type II collagen gradually over time, and promoted histologic healing in a rabbit model.ADSC implantation designed to promote osteochondral healing may play an important role in osteochondral healing.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10856-017-5928-1,Regeneration of hyaline cartilage promoted by xenogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells embedded within elastin-like recombinamer-based bioactive hydrogels,"Over the last decades, novel therapeutic tools for osteochondral regeneration have arisen from the combination of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and highly specialized smart biomaterials, such as hydrogel-forming elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), which could serve as cell-carriers. Herein, we evaluate the delivery of xenogeneic human MSCs (hMSCs) within an injectable ELR-based hydrogel carrier for osteochondral regeneration in rabbits. First, a critical-size osteochondral defect was created in the femora of the animals and subsequently filled with the ELR-based hydrogel alone or with embedded hMSCs. Regeneration outcomes were evaluated after three months by gross assessment, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, showing complete filling of the defect and the de novo formation of hyaline-like cartilage and subchondral bone in the hMSC-treated knees. Furthermore, histological sectioning and staining of every sample confirmed regeneration of the full cartilage thickness and early subchondral bone repair, which was more similar to the native cartilage in the case of the cell-loaded ELR-based hydrogel. Overall histological differences between the two groups were assessed semi-quantitatively using the Wakitani scale and found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence against a human mitochondrial antibody three months post-implantation showed that the hMSCs were integrated into the de novo formed tissue, thus suggesting their ability to overcome the interspecies barrier. Hence, we conclude that the use of xenogeneic MSCs embedded in an ELR-based hydrogel leads to the successful regeneration of hyaline cartilage in osteochondral lesions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603516681131,Correlation of MRI Appearance of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in the Ankle with Clinical Outcome,"The objective of this study was to characterize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and correlate with clinical results in patients who underwent autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT).Twenty-four grafts were evaluated at a mean 65.8 months after ACI for OLT. MRI was performed on a 1.5-T GE scanner using multiple sequences. Graft appearance was compared with preoperative MRI and evaluated for 6 criteria: defect fill, surface regularity, signal pattern, bone marrow edema, subchondral plate irregularity, and presence of cystic lesions. Clinical outcome was measured with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) clinical outcome score.Of 24 grafts, 22 (92%) demonstrated >75% defect fill. Eighteen (75%) had a mildly irregular and 6 (25%) had a moderately irregular articular surface. The signal pattern of the repair tissue was heterogenous in 23 (96%); 14 (58%) layered and 9 (38%) mottled. Fourteen grafts (58%) showed decreased amount of bone marrow edema while 4 (17%) had no change and 5 (21%) had an increase in the amount of bone marrow edema. The subchondral bone plate was abnormal in most grafts, with focal defects seen in 10, slight depression in 7, and both in 5. Seven had an increase in cystic lesions while the others had no change, decrease or no cysts seen. Mean postoperative AOFAS score was 87.5 with mean improvement of 39.4.At 66-month mean follow-up, MRI appearance of the ACI grafts show imaging abnormalities but demonstrate good clinical results. While MRI is an important tool in the postoperative assessment of ACI grafts, the various variations from a normal/nonoperative ankle must be interpreted with caution.",0

The aim of our study was to evaluate the chromosomal stability of human chondrocytes subjected to typical cell culture procedures needed for regenerative approaches in polymer-scaffold-assisted cartilage repair. Chondrocytes derived from post mortem donors and from donors scheduled for ACI were expanded, cryopreserved and re-arranged in polyglycolic acid (PGA)–fibrin scaffolds for tissue culture. Chondrocyte redifferentiation was analyzed by electron microscopy, histology and gene expression analysis. Karyotyping was performed using GTG banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization on a single cell basis. Chondrocytes showed de- and redifferentiation accompanied by the formation of extracellular matrix and induction of typical chondrocyte marker genes like type II collagen in PGA–fibrin scaffolds. Post mortem chondrocytes showed up to 1.7% structural and high numbers of numerical (up to 26.7%) chromosomal aberrations, while chondrocytes from living donors scheduled for ACI showed up to 1.8% structural and up to 1.3% numerical alterations. Cytogenetically, cell culture procedures and PGA–fibrin scaffolds did not significantly alter chromosomal integrity of the chondrocyte genome. Human chondrocytes derived from living donors subjected to regenerative medicine cell culture procedures like cell expansion, cryopreservation and culture in resorbable polymer-based scaffolds show normal chromosomal integrity and normal karyotypes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2015.07.008,Treatment of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus With Bone Marrow Stimulation and Chitosan–Glycerol Phosphate/Blood Implants (BST-CarGel),"Bone marrow stimulation (BMS) techniques represent the first-line treatment for unstable osteochondral lesions of the talus or after conservative treatment failure. These techniques are intended to penetrate the subchondral bone to elicit bleeding and allow precursor cells and cytokines from bone marrow to populate the lesion. However, the fibrocartilaginous repair tissue arising after marrow stimulation confers inferior mechanical and biological properties compared with the original hyaline cartilage. The limitations of BMS can be overcome by the use of the soluble chitosan-based polymer BST-CarGel (Piramal Life Sciences, Laval, Quebec, Canada). When mixed with freshly drawn autologous whole blood and applied to a lesion surgically prepared by BMS, BST-CarGel acts as a natural bioscaffold that increases the quantity and improves the residency of the blood clot formed in the cartilage lesion, enhancing the local healing response. The use of BST-CarGel has been previously described in the knee and hip joints with successful results. We describe the arthroscopic technique for BST-CarGel application in combination with BMS techniques for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus.",0
https://doi.org/10.1021/nn504494c,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Stem Cell Apoptosis in Arthritic Joints with a Caspase Activatable Contrast Agent,"About 43 million individuals in the U.S. encounter cartilage injuries due to trauma or osteoarthritis, leading to joint pain and functional disability. Matrix-associated stem cell implants (MASI) represent a promising approach for repair of cartilage defects. However, limited survival of MASI creates a significant bottleneck for successful cartilage regeneration outcomes and functional reconstitution. We report an approach for noninvasive detection of stem cell apoptosis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), based on a caspase-3-sensitive nanoaggregation MRI probe (C-SNAM). C-SNAM self-assembles into nanoparticles after hydrolysis by caspase-3, leading to 90% amplification of (1)H MR signal and prolonged in vivo retention. Following intra-articular injection, C-SNAM causes significant MR signal enhancement in apoptotic MASI compared to viable MASI. Our results indicate that C-SNAM functions as an imaging probe for stem cell apoptosis in MASI. This concept could be applied to a broad range of cell transplants and target sites.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2428-9,Satisfactory long-term MRI after autologous chondrocyte implantation at the knee,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) to address isolated condylar lesions is supposed to limit degenerative deterioration in neutrally aligned knees. Here, we report long-term results of the first-generation ACI technique with periosteal flap. Twelve patients, 29 years old on average, were included on the basis of pre-operative MRI selection of lesions \textbackslashtextgreater 2 cm(2). Cartilage carrots were harvested arthroscopically, then cultured and finally re-implanted within a mean time interval of 12 weeks. Ten-year MRI results were analysed according to a semi-quantitative scale, along with functional assessment based on International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm et al. score and the Tegner et al. activity scale. One patient secondarily required valgus tibial osteotomy with mosaic plasty. Another incurred graft hypertrophy that necessitated arthroscopic peeling. MRI showed that cartilage repair filled more than 50 % of the initial defect in 9 patients. Standard radiographs revealed slight narrowing of the joint line. Overall, functional scores improved durably by 50 %, although activity level decreased substantially. ACI contained degenerative changes within moderate stages while maintaining durable functional improvement. However, in the absence of controls, it was difficult to differentiate between these findings and the spontaneous evolution of non-treated lesions. Case series, Level IV.",0

We previously developed a mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based treatment approach for haemophilic arthropathy in a mouse model of haemophilia A. Here, we evaluated the long-term safety of intra-articular injection of lentivirally transduced autologous MSCs in non-human primates. Autologous bone-marrow-derived MSCs transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) were injected into the left knee joint of cynomolgus monkeys. We first conducted codon optimization to increase FVIII production in the cells. Lentiviral transduction of autologous MSCs resulted in a significant increase of FVIII in the culture supernatant before transplantation. We did not find any tumour generation around the knee structure at 11-16 months after injection by magnetic resonance imaging. The proviral sequence of the simian immunodeficiency virus lentiviral vector was not detected in the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, testis, or bone marrow by real-time quantitative PCR. We confirmed the long-term safety of intra-articular injection of transduced MSCs in a non-human primate. The procedure may be an attractive therapeutic approach for joint diseases in haemophilia patients.",0

When these lesions are symptomatic and fail nonoperative management several surgical strategies are available. Common surgical techniques include reparative (ie, microfracture) and restorative procedures (ie, autologous chondrocyte implantation, particulated juvenile allograft cartilage, osteochondral autograft transfer, and osteochondral allograft). Each of these surgical procedures have shared and novel complications associated with their use. This article provides a detailed, case-based discussion of common complications encountered in surgical procedures for focal cartilage defects of the knee, highlighting causes, clinical recognition, and how to address and avoid these complications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-018-5242-6,Bone block augmentation from the iliac crest for treatment of deep osteochondral defects of the knee resembles biomechanical properties of the subchondral bone,"PurposeBone block augmentation from the iliac crest can be used for reconstruction of the osteochondral unit to restore the underlying subchondral bone upon restoration of the cartilaginous layer via matrix-induced chondrocyte transplantation. To critically understand the successful restoration of the defect, biomechanical and histological analysis of the implanted bone blocks is required. The aim of the study was to analyse the ability of the bone block technique to restore huge bone defects by mimicking the physiological subchondral zone.MethodsThe experiments were performed using lateral femoral condyles and iliac crest bone grafts from the same cadavers (n=6) preserved using the Thiel method. CT scans were made to evaluate bone pathology. Bone mineral density of all specimens was evaluated in the femoral head prior to testing. A series of tests were conducted for each pair of specimens. A static compression test was performed using an electro dynamic testing machine with maximal strength and failure behavior analyzed. Biomechanical tests were performed in the medial-lateral direction for iliac crest and for femoral condyles with and without removal of the cartilage layer. Histological analysis was performed on decalcified specimens for comparison of the condyle at lesion site and the graft.ResultsNo significant difference in failure load could be found for iliac crest (53.3-180.5N) and femoral condyle samples upon cartilage removal (38.5-175.1N) (n.s.). The femoral condyles with an intact cartilage layer showed significantly higher loads (118.3-260.4N) compared to the other groups indicating that native or regenerated cartilage can further increase the failure load (p\textbackslashtextless0.05). Bone mineral density significantly influenced failure load in all study groups (p\textbackslashtextless0.05). Histological similarity of the cancellous bone in the femoral condyle and in the iliac crest was observed. However, within the subchondral zone, there was a higher density of sponge like organized trabeculae in the bone samples from the iliac crest. Tide mark was only detected at the osteochondral interface in femoral condyles.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that, bone blocks derived from the iliac crest allow a biomechanical appropriate and stable restoration of huge bony defects by resembling the subchondral zone of the femoral condyle. Therefore, bone augmentation from the iliac crest combined with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be a reasonable method to treat these challenging injuries.",0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of intraarticular injection of the small-molecule compound kartogenin (KGN) on the restoration of a full-thickness cartilage defect treated with microfracture in a rabbit model.Full-thickness cartilage defects (3.5 mm in diameter and 3 mm in depth) were created in the patellar groove of the right femurs of 24 female New Zealand White rabbits. The rabbits were divided into two groups (12 in each group) based on postsurgery treatment differences, as follows: microfracture plus weekly intraarticular injection of KGN (group 1) and microfracture plus dimethyl sulfoxide (group 2). Six rabbits from each group were illed at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery, and their knees were harvested. The outcome was assessed both macroscopically, by using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic evaluation system, and histologically, by using the modified O'Driscoll histologic scoring system. Immunohistochemistry for type II and I collagen was also conducted.At 4 weeks, group 1 showed better defect filling and a greater number of chondrocyte-like cells compared with group 2. At 12 weeks, group 1 showed statistically significantly higher ICRS scores and modified O'Driscoll scores compared with group 2. More hyaline cartilage-like tissue was found in the defects of group 1 at 12 weeks.Intraarticular injection of KGN enhances the quality of full-thickness cartilage defects repair after microfracture, with better defect filling and increased hyaline-like cartilage formation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27287,Pulsed electromagnetic fields promote repair of focal articular cartilage defects with engineered osteochondral constructs,"Articular cartilage injuries are a common source of joint pain and dysfunction. We hypothesized that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) would improve growth and healing of tissue-engineered cartilage grafts in a direction-dependent manner. PEMF stimulation of engineered cartilage constructs was first evaluated in vitro using passaged adult canine chondrocytes embedded in an agarose hydrogel scaffold. PEMF coils oriented parallel to the articular surface induced superior repair stiffness compared to both perpendicular PEMF (p = .026) and control (p = .012). This was correlated with increased glycosaminoglycan deposition in both parallel and perpendicular PEMF orientations compared to control (p = .010 and .028, respectively). Following in vitro optimization, the potential clinical translation of PEMF was evaluated in a preliminary in vivo preclinical adult canine model. Engineered osteochondral constructs (∅ 6 mm × 6 mm thick, devitalized bone base) were cultured to maturity and implanted into focal defects created in the stifle (knee) joint. To assess expedited early repair, animals were assessed after a 3-month recovery period, with microfracture repairs serving as an additional clinical control. In vivo, PEMF led to a greater likelihood of normal chondrocyte (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5, p = .051) and proteoglycan (OR: 5.0, p = .013) histological scores in engineered constructs. Interestingly, engineered constructs outperformed microfracture in clinical scoring, regardless of PEMF treatment (p < .05). Overall, the studies provided evidence that PEMF stimulation enhanced engineered cartilage growth and repair, demonstrating a potential low-cost, low-risk, noninvasive treatment modality for expediting early cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-799x-7-37,An ovine in vitro model for chondrocyte-based scaffold-assisted cartilage grafts,"Abstract Background Scaffold-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation is an effective clinical procedure for cartilage repair. From the regulatory point of view, the ovine model is one of the suggested large animal models for pre-clinical studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the in vitro re-differentiation capacity of expanded ovine chondrocytes in biomechanically characterized polyglycolic acid (PGA)/fibrin biomaterials for scaffold-assisted cartilage repair. Methods Ovine chondrocytes harvested from adult articular cartilage were expanded in monolayer and re-assembled three-dimensionally in PGA-fibrin scaffolds. De- and re-differentiation of ovine chondrocytes in PGA-fibrin scaffolds was assessed by histological and immuno-histochemical staining as well as by real-time gene expression analysis of typical cartilage marker molecules and the matrix-remodelling enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -1, -2 and −13 as well as their inhibitors. PGA scaffolds characteristics including degradation and stiffness were analysed by electron microscopy and biomechanical testing. Results Histological, immuno-histochemical and gene expression analysis showed that dedifferentiated chondrocytes re-differentiate in PGA-fibrin scaffolds and form a cartilaginous matrix. Re-differentiation was accompanied by the induction of type II collagen and aggrecan, while MMP expression decreased in prolonged tissue culture. Electron microscopy and biomechanical tests revealed that the non-woven PGA scaffold shows a textile structure with high tensile strength of 3.6 N/mm 2 and a stiffness of up to 0.44 N/mm 2 , when combined with gel-like fibrin. Conclusion These data suggest that PGA-fibrin is suited as a mechanically stable support structure for scaffold-assisted chondrocyte grafts, initiating chondrogenic re-differentiation of expanded chondrocytes.",0

Demographic information, patient-reported outcomes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the number and type of reoperations were assessed. Failure was defined as revision surgery with removal of the implant. Patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively using the Short Form-36, Activity of Daily Living Score, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Evaluation, Cincinnati Knee Rating System, and Marx Activity Scale. MRIs were evaluated using the OsteoChondral Allograft MRI Scoring System.Thirty-four patients were identified, with a mean age of 45 (±11.9) years; 71% were male. Fifteen (44%) patients had undergone prior ipsilateral surgical intervention. Mean defect size was 4 (±1.5) cm2, and median number of allografts per knee was 2 (range, 1-5). Mean follow-up duration was 15.5 months (range, 6-24). Ten patients (29%) required revision surgery with removal of the implant. Implant survivorship was 61% at 2 years. Female gender was independently predictive of failure, with a hazard ratio of 9.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-58.9; P = .005). Defect size was also independently predictive of failure, with a hazard ratio of 1.9 per 1 cm2 increase (95% CI, 1.2-3.1; P = .005). MRIs obtained at 1 year postoperatively demonstrated significantly improved osseous integration (P = .0086) and opposing cartilage (P = .019) in the nonfailure group as compared with the failure group.Based on the high short-term failure rate observed in this study, the authors advise that a decellularized OC allograft plugs implant should be used with caution in the treatment of OC lesions of the knee, as similar outcomes have not been noted with other cartilage restoration techniques.

Purpose: To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of autologous freshly isolated primary chondrocytes and bone marrow mononucleated cells (MNCs) seeded into a PolyActive scaffold in patients with symptomatic cartilage lesions of the knee. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 40 patients with symptomatic knee cartilage lesions were treated with freshly isolated autologous chondrocytes combined with bone marrow MNCs delivered in a biodegradable load-bearing scaffold. The treatment requires only 1 surgical intervention and is potentially a cost-effective alternative to autologous chondrocyte implantation. The primary chondrocytes and bone marrow MNCs were isolated, washed, counted, mixed, and seeded into a load-bearing scaffold in the operating room. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Primary endpoints were treatment-related adverse events up to 3 months, adverse implant effects between 3 and 24 months, and the implant success rate at 3 months as measured by lesion filling. Results: Successful lesion filling (≥67% on magnetic resonance imaging) was found in 40 patients at 3 months and in 32 of the 32 patients analyzed at 24 months. Significant improvement over baseline was found for visual analog scale for pain from 3 months onward; Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-Pain and KOOS-Activities of Daily Living from 6 months onward; for KOOS-Symptoms and Stiffness, KOOS-Quality of Life and International Knee Documentation Committee from 12 months onward; and for KOOS-Sport and Recreation from 18 months onward. Hyaline-like repair tissue was found in 22 of 31 patients available for biopsy. Arthralgia and joint effusion were the most common adverse events. Scaffold delamination and adhesions led to removal of the implant in 2 patients. Conclusion: The treatment of knee cartilage lesions with autologous primary chondrocytes and bone marrow MNCs, both isolated and seeded into a load-bearing PolyActive scaffold within a single surgical intervention, is safe and clinically effective. Good lesion fill and sustained clinically important and statistically significant improvement in all patient-reported outcome scores were found throughout the 24-month study. Hyaline-like cartilage was observed on biopsy specimen in at least 22 of the 40 patients. Registration: NCT01041885 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier)",0

There was a lack of blinding for patients because of the additional intervention method (liposuction). The cartilage defect was diagnosed using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quantitative and qualitative assessments of the repair tissue were carried out at 24 months by using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue scoring system with follow-up MRI. Clinical results were evaluated using the Lysholm score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and a 10-point visual analog scale for pain (0 points, no pain; 10 points, worst possible pain) preoperatively and postoperatively at 3 months, 12 months, and the last follow-up visit.The 2 groups had similar baseline patient characteristics. Follow-up MRI was performed at 24 months (mean, 24.3 months; range, 24.0 to 25.1 months) after the operation. Group 1 included 26 patients (65%) who had complete cartilage coverage of the lesion at follow-up compared with 18 patients (45%) in group 2. Significantly better signal intensity was observed for the repair tissue in group 1, with 32 patients (80%) having normal or nearly normal signal intensity (i.e., complete cartilage coverage of the lesion) compared with 28 patients (72.5%) in group 2. The mean clinical follow-up period was 27.4 months (range, 26 to 30 months). The improvements in the mean KOOS pain and symptom subscores were significantly greater at follow-up in group 1 than in group 2 (pain, 36.6 ± 11.9 in group 1 and 30.1 ± 14.7 in group 2 [P = .034]; symptoms, 32.3 ± 7.2 in group 1 and 27.8 ± 6.8 in group 2 [P = .005]). However, the improvements in the other subscores were not significantly different between group 1 and group 2 (activities of daily living, 38.5 ± 12.8 and 37.6 ± 12.9, respectively [P = .767]; sports and recreation, 33.9 ± 10.3 and 31.6 ± 11.0, respectively [P = .338]; quality of life, 38.4 ± 13.1 and 37.8 ± 12.0, respectively [P = .650]). Among the 80 patients, second-look arthroscopies were performed in 57 knees (30 in group 1 and 27 in group 2), and biopsy procedures were performed during these arthroscopies for 18 patients in group 1 and 16 patients in group 2. The second-look arthroscopies showed good repair tissue quality, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. The mean total histologic score was 1,054 for group 1 compared with 967 for group 2 (P = .036). Age, lesion size, duration of symptoms before surgery, mechanism of injury, and combined procedures were not correlated with clinical results, Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue scores, and histologic outcomes at short-term follow-up.Compared with MFX alone, MFX and ADSCs with fibrin glue provided radiologic and KOOS pain and symptom subscore improvements, with no differences in activity, sports, or quality-of-life subscores, in symptomatic single cartilage defects of the knee that were 3 cm(2) or larger, with similar structural repair tissue.Level II, prospective comparative study.",1
https://doi.org/10.1097/jsa.0b013e31818d56b3,Emerging Technologies and Fourth Generation Issues in Cartilage Repair,"The goals of successful cartilage repair include reducing pain, improving symptoms, and long-term function; preventing early osteoarthritis and subsequent total knee replacements; and rebuilding hyaline cartilage instead of fibrous tissue. Current methods such as microfracture, osteoarticular autograft transfer system, mosaicplasty, and autologous chondrocyte implantation are somewhat successful in regenerating cartilage; however, they also have significant limitations. The future of fourth generation cartilage repair focuses on gene therapy, the use of stem cells (bone marrow, adipose, or muscle derived), and tissue engineering. Emerging techniques include creating elastin-like polymers derived from native elastin sequences to serve as biocompatible scaffolds; using hydrogels to obtain a homogeneous distribution of cells within a 3-dimensional matrix; and using nonviral gene delivery via nucleofection to allow mesenchymal stem cells the ability to express osteogenic growth factors. Although many of the techniques mentioned have yet to be used in a cartilage regeneration model, we have tried to anticipate how methods used in other specialties may facilitate improved cartilage repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-007-0513-6,No mid-term difference in mosaicplasty in previously treated versus previously untreated patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus,"INTRODUCTION: Osteochondral transplantations, albeit technically challenging, appear promising not only in knee joint lesions, but also in the treatment of talus lesions. We hypothesized that in patients suffering osteochondral lesions of the talus, favorable outcomes are obtained in patients undergoing primary mosaicplasty as compared to patients undergoing secondary mosaicplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 3-year period (1998-2001), 14 patients (six male, eight female, median age 22 years) were treated with an autologous osteochondral transplantation of the talus. Eight patients were previously untreated (group I). Six patients had previous ankle procedures, such as microfracturing (group II). The median follow-up was 24 months and 100% complete at 12 months. The functional outcome was evaluated at least at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after surgery using pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and sports activity was recorded at 1 year after surgery. In ten patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the ankle was performed at 1 year after surgery (group I/II: 7/3). RESULTS: Overall ankle pain was decreased from 6.9 +/- 2.1 to 4.0 +/- 2.8 postoperatively. The mean knee pain for the donor knee was 2.6 +/- 2.4. We found no significant difference between the primary mosaicplasty group and the secondary mosaicplasty group with regard to pain. MRI scans of ten patients showed a complete incorporation of the osteochondral cylinders at 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSION: Favorable outcomes were obtained in patients undergoing primary mosaicplasty as compared to patients undergoing secondary mosaicplasty. We found no significant difference among patients with previous ankle surgery in contrast to those without, with a median 24-months follow-up.",0

In five sheep, a similar defect was filled with an osteochondral autograft, and the donor site was filled with a biphasic construct combining CaP granules and a chitosan/cellulosic polymer. Sheep were monitored daily for lameness. Stifle radiographs and MRI were evaluated at 20 weeks, prior to animals being humanely killed. Surgical sites were evaluated with histology, microcomputed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy.Clinical outcomes were satisfactory regardless of the tested biomaterials. All implants appeared in place on imaging studies. Osteointegration of prosthetic implants varied between sites, with limited ingrowth of new bone into the titanium structure. Autografts and biphasic constructs were consistently well integrated in subchondral bone. All autografts except one contained a cartilage surface, and all biphasic constructs except one partially restored hyaline cartilage surface.Biphasic constructs supported hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration, although restoration of the articular cartilage was incomplete.Biphasic constructs may provide an alternative treatment for osteochondral defects, offering a less invasive approach compared with autologous grafts and eliminating the requirement for a prosthetic implant.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1603800,Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate versus Platelet Rich Plasma to Enhance Osseous Integration Potential for Osteochondral Allografts,"Abstract Fresh osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation is an attractive treatment option for symptomatic articular cartilage lesions in young, healthy patients. Since a lack of OCA bone integration can be a cause of treatment failure, methods for speeding and enhancing OCA bone integration to mitigate this potential complication are highly desirable. This study sought to determine and compare the potential of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) and leukoreduced platelet rich plasma (PRP) to repopulate the osseous portion of an OCA with cells and deliver osteogenic proteins. It was hypothesized that BMC would have significantly higher colony forming units (CFUs)/mL and seed the osseous portion of OCA with more cells than PRP. Finally, we hypothesized that the media of BMC and PRP treated OCAs would have significantly higher concentrations of osteogenic proteins compared with negative control OCAs. Cylindrical OCAs (n = 36) created from tissue stored for 21 days were treated with BMC (n = 12) or PRP (n = 12) obtained for 6 dogs, or left untreated as a negative control (n = 12). After treatment, OCAs were cultured for 7 or 14 days. Media were collected for analysis of osteogenic biomarker concentration. Samples of each BMC and PRP were tested for CFU concentration. On day 7 or 14, the grafts were assessed for cell surface adhesion and penetration using fluorescent microscopy. Significant differences in CFU and media biomarker concentration between the groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc test with the significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Only OCAs saturated with BMC had viable cells detectable on the osseous portion of the allografts at day 7 and 14 of culture. BMC samples had a significantly higher (p = 0.029) CFU/mL compared with PRP samples. At day 3 and/or 7 of culture, the concentration of several osteogenic proteins was significantly higher in both BMC and PRP samples. Autogenous BMC can be used to deliver both a cell population and osteogenic proteins that may improve healing of the osseous portion of the OCA clinically.",1

MRI was used for the morphological analysis of cartilage repair. The correlation between MRI findings and clinical outcome was also studied.A biodegradable, alginate-based biocompatible scaffold containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes was used for the treatment of symptomatic chondral and osteochondral lesions in the knee. Twenty-one patients were prospectively evaluated with use of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain preoperatively and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of follow-up. Of the 21 patients, 12 had consented to follow the postoperative MRI evaluation protocol. MRI data were analyzed based on the original MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) and modified MOCART scoring system. The correlation between the clinical outcome and MRI findings was evaluated.A statistically significant clinical improvement became apparent after 6 months and patients continued to improve during the 12 months of follow-up. One of the two MRI scoring systems that were used, showed a statistically significant deterioration of the repair tissue at 1 year of follow-up. Twelve months after the operation complete filling or hypertrophy was found in 41.6%. Bone-marrow edema and effusion were seen in 41.7% and 25% of the study patients, respectively. We did not find a consistent correlation between the MRI criteria and the clinical results.The present study confirmed the primary role of MRI in the evaluation of cartilage repair. Two MOCART-based scoring systems were used in a longitudinal fashion and allowed a practical and morphological evaluation of the repair tissue. However, the correlation between clinical outcome and MRI findings was poor. Further validation of these scoring systems is mandatory. The promising short-term clinical outcome of the allogenic chondrocytes/alginate beads implantation was not confirmed by the short-term MRI findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep33747,Devitalisation of human cartilage by high hydrostatic pressure treatment: Subsequent cultivation of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells on the devitalised tissue,"The regeneration of cartilage lesions still represents a major challenge. Cartilage has a tissue-specific architecture, complicating recreation by synthetic biomaterials. A novel approach for reconstruction is the use of devitalised cartilage. Treatment with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) achieves devitalisation while biomechanical properties are remained. Therefore, in the present study, cartilage was devitalised using HHP treatment and the potential for revitalisation with chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was investigated. The devitalisation of cartilage was performed by application of 480 MPa over 10 minutes. Effective cellular inactivation was demonstrated by the trypan blue exclusion test and DNA quantification. Histology and electron microscopy examinations showed undamaged cartilage structure after HHP treatment. For revitalisation chondrocytes and MSCs were cultured on devitalised cartilage without supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors. Both chondrocytes and MSCs significantly increased expression of cartilage-specific genes. ECM stainings showed neocartilage-like structure with positive AZAN staining as well as collagen type II and aggrecan deposition after three weeks of cultivation. Our results showed that HHP treatment caused devitalisation of cartilage tissue. ECM proteins were not influenced, thus, providing a scaffold for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and chondrocytes. Therefore, using HHP-treated tissue might be a promising approach for cartilage repair.",0

For functional evaluation, the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) score, and Short Form-12 (SF-12) general health questionnaire were used. We also investigated the level of sports activity before and after the surgery. Sixteen patients were included in this study, and the mean follow-up period was 29.8 months.The mean VAS score improved from 8.3 (range, 6-10) preoperatively to 1.8 (range, 0-4) postoperatively. The mean FAAM score was improved from 57.6 (range, 6.0-88.9) for the activities of daily living subscale and 34.5 (range, 3.1-92.6) for the sports subscale to 84.3 (range, 46.4-100.0) and 65.2 (range, 23.3-55.1) for each subscale, respectively, at the final follow-up. There were also improvements in the SF-12 score, from 36.3 (range, 23.3-55.1) preoperatively to 46.0 (range, 18.9-56.6) postoperatively for the SF-12 PCS, and from 41.3 (range, 14.2-65.0) preoperatively to 52.6 (range, 32.8-60.8) postoperatively for the SF-12 MCS. All functional scores showed significant differences clinically and statistically at the final follow-up. The level of sports activity after the surgery was significantly lower than their level before the surgery (P = .012).Arthroscopic microfracture provided satisfactory clinical outcomes for osteochondral lesions of the tibial plafond. Though all the patients in this study were able to return to sports activity after the surgery, the postoperative level of sports activity was significantly lower than their preoperative level.Level IV, retrospective case series.",0

We tested the hypothesis that in skeletally aged rabbit knees, microdrill holes can be stimulated to remodel the bone plate and induce a more integrated, voluminous and hyaline cartilage repair tissue when treated by subchondral chitosan/blood implants.New Zealand White rabbits (13 or 32 months old, N = 7) received two 1.5 mm diameter, 2 mm depth drill holes in each knee, either left to bleed as surgical controls or press-fit with a 10 kDa (distal hole: 10K) or 40 kDa (proximal hole: 40K) chitosan/blood implant with fluorescent chitosan tracer. Post-operative knee effusion was documented. Repair tissues at day 0 (N = 1) and day 70 post-surgery (N = 6) were analyzed by micro-computed tomography, and by histological scoring and histomorphometry (SafO, Col-2, and Col-1) at day 70.All chitosan implants were completely cleared after 70 days, without increasing transient post-operative knee effusion compared to controls. Proximal control holes had worse osteochondral repair than distal holes. Both implant formulations induced bone remodeling and improved lateral integration of the bone plate at the hole edge. The 40K implant inhibited further bone repair inside 50% of the proximal holes, while the 10K implant specifically induced a ""wound bloom"" reaction, characterized by decreased bone plate density in a limited zone beyond the initial hole edge, and increased woven bone (WB) plate repair inside the initial hole (P = 0.016), which was accompanied by a more voluminous and hyaline cartilage repair (P < 0.05 vs control defects).In a challenging aged rabbit model, bone marrow-derived hyaline cartilage repair can be promoted by treating acute drill holes with a biodegradable subchondral implant that elicits bone plate resorption followed by anabolic WB repair within a 70-day repair period.",0

We present 57 patients (31 male, 26 female) with a mean age of 31.6 years (range 15-51 years) that have undergone ACI since July 1998. The mean size of the defect was 3.14 cm(2) (range 1.0-7.0 cm(2)). All patients were assessed annually using seven independent validated clinical rating scores with the data analysed using ANOVA. ACI using a porcine type I/III collagen membrane cover produced statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001), maintained for up to six years, in knee symptoms compared to pre-operative levels.

https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.n.00404,Evaluation of Articular Cartilage Progenitor Cells for the Repair of Articular Defects in an Equine Model,"We sought to determine the effectiveness of chondroprogenitor cells derived from autologous and allogenic articular cartilage for the repair of cartilage defects in an equine model.Cartilage defects (15 mm) were created on the medial trochlear ridge of the femur. The following experimental treatments were compared with empty-defect controls: fibrin only, autologous chondroprogenitor cells plus fibrin, and allogenic chondroprogenitor cells plus fibrin (n = 4 or 12 per treatment). Horses underwent strenuous exercise throughout the twelve-month study, and evaluations included lameness (pain) and arthroscopic, radiographic, gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical analyses.Arthroscopy and microscopy indicated that defects in the autologous cell group had significantly better repair tissue compared with defects in the fibrin-only and control groups. Repair tissue quality in the allogenic cell group was not superior to that in the fibrin-only group with the exception of the percentage of type-II collagen, which was greater. Radiographic changes in the allogenic cell group were poorer on average than those in the autologous cell group. Autologous cells significantly reduced central osteophyte formation compared with fibrin alone.On the basis of the arthroscopic, radiographic, and histologic scores, autologous cells in fibrin yielded better results than the other treatments; allogenic cells cannot be recommended at this time.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.21514,Longitudinal evaluation of cartilage after osteochondral autogenous transfer with delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the cartilage (dGEMRIC),"The aim was to use repeat delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) to estimate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in reparative cartilage after osteochondral autogenous transfer (OAT). The study group comprised 7 knees of 7 patients that were examined three times by dGEMRIC, at 3, 6, and 12 months using a 1.5 Tesla MRI system in both OAT operated and nonoperated condyles at 90 min after the injection. The gadolinium diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA)(2-) containing contrast medium (0.2 mmols/kg) was injected intravenously. The mean T1 values of the plug cartilage at 3, 6, and 12 months after OAT was 230 ± 40, 213 ± 31, and 230 ± 23 ms (mean ± SD), respectively. There were differences between the plug and control cartilage at 3 (p < 0.01) and 12 (p < 0.05) months after OAT, but not at 6 months (p = 0.089). No T1 changes were detected between the plug cartilage at the different time points after OAT. The fact that the GAG content of the OAT plugs were maintained for 12-month study period suggest that no major deterioration of load-bearing properties occurs in the cartilage after the OAT.",0

A cell-free biomimetic osteochondral scaffold showed positive results in adult patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of this scaffold for the treatment of knee JOCD at mid-term follow-up.Twenty patients (14 males, 6 females) were included in this study. Mean age was 16.2 ± 1.4 years, average defect size was 3.2 ± 1.8 cm2, and mean symptoms duration was 20.2 ± 17.9 months. After the implantation of the osteochondral collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold (Maioregen, Fin-Ceramica, Faenza, Italy), patients were evaluated preoperatively and prospectively at 1, 2, and at final mean follow-up of 6 years (range 5-7 years) with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective, Tegner, and EuroQol visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. MRI evaluation was performed with the MOCART 2.0 score.All scores showed a significant improvement. IKDC subjective score went from 50.3 ± 17.4 preoperative score to 75.3 ± 14.6 at 1 year (P = 0.002), 80.8 ± 14.6 at 2 years and 85.0 ± 9.3 at 6 years. The Tegner score improved from the preoperative evaluation of 2.6 ± 1.4 to 5.5 ± 2.0 at 6 years (P < 0.0005), although without reaching the level registered before the onset of symptoms. A longer symptoms duration influenced negatively IKDC subjective and Tegner scores up to 2 years (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively) but did not affect the final outcome. Lesion size did not affect the final result. The MOCART 2.0 score showed a significant improvement between 1-year and final follow-up, but with persisting subchondral alterations.This study demonstrated a clinical improvement stable over time with a high survival rate, although with persisting abnormal MRI findings, especially at subchondral bone level.

A variety of surgical techniques have been developed. However, the optimal surgical technique is still controversial. We present a novel technique in which autologous bone grafting is combined with gel-type autologous chondrocyte implantation (GACI).Isolated severe osteochondral defects of the medial or lateral femoral condyle were treated by a two-step procedure. Firstly, chondrocytes were harvested during arthroscopy and cultured for 6 weeks. Secondly, a full thickness corticospongious autologuos bone graft, harvested from the medial or lateral femur condyle, is impacted in the defect and covered by GACI. The fibrin gel fills up to the exact shape of the chondral lesion and polymerizes within 3 min after application.From 2009 to 2011, 9 patients, median age 35 years (range 23–47), were treated by the combined autologous bone grafting and GACI technique. Median defect size was 7.1 cm2 (range 2.5–12.0), and median depth of the lesion was 0.9 cm (range 0.8–1.2). Median follow-up was 9 months (range 6–12 months). Six patients were available for 12-month follow-up. The mean IKDC score showed a 6-month improvement from 35 (SD ± 16) to 51 (SD ± 18) (n = 9; p = 0.01), and a 1-year improvement from 35 (SD ± 16) to 57 (SD ± 20) (n = 6; p = 0.03). The mean KOOS improved from 44 (SD ± 16) to 62 (SD ± 19) (n = 9; p = 0.07) at 6-month follow-up and from 44 (SD ± 16) to 65 (SD ± 24) (n = 6; p = 0.1) at 12-month follow-up. There was one failure that needed conversion to a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.Combined autologous bone grafting and GACI may offer an alternative surgical option for severe and unstable osteochondral defects of the knee.",0

The MACI implant is fixed with fibrin glue, and little or no suturing is necessary. The procedure can be performed arthroscopically or by miniarthrotomy. The use of magnetic resonance imaging shows progressive signal change with progressive loss of subchondral edema.

https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.j.00049,Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"The purpose of the present study was to determine (1) whether the current literature supports the choice of using autologous chondrocyte implantation over other cartilage procedures with regard to clinical outcome, magnetic resonance imaging, arthroscopic assessment, and durability of treatment, (2) whether the current literature supports the use of a specific generation of autologous chondrocyte implantation, and (3) whether there are patient-specific and defect-specific factors that influence outcomes after autologous chondrocyte implantation in comparison with other cartilage repair or restoration procedures.We conducted a systematic review of multiple databases in which we evaluated Level-I and II studies comparing autologous chondrocyte implantation with another cartilage repair or restoration technique as well as comparative intergenerational studies of autologous chondrocyte implantation. The methodological quality of studies was evaluated with use of Delphi list and modified Coleman methodology scores. Effect size analysis was performed for all outcome measures.Thirteen studies (917 subjects) were included. Study methodological quality improved with later publication dates. The mean modified Coleman methodology score was 54 (of 100). Patients underwent autologous chondrocyte implantation (n = 604), microfracture (n = 271), or osteochondral autograft (n = 42). All surgical techniques demonstrated improvement in comparison with the preoperative status. Three of seven studies showed better clinical outcomes after autologous chondrocyte implantation in comparison with microfracture after one to three years of follow-up, whereas one study showed better outcomes two years after microfracture and three other studies showed no difference in these treatments after one to five years. Clinical outcomes after microfracture deteriorated after eighteen to twenty-four months (in three of seven studies). Autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral autograft demonstrated equivalent short-term clinical outcomes, although there was more rapid improvement after osteochondral autograft (two studies). Although outcomes were equivalent between first and second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation and between open and arthroscopic autologous chondrocyte implantation, complication rates were higher with open, periosteal-cover, first-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (four studies). Younger patients with a shorter preoperative duration of symptoms and fewer prior surgical procedures had the best outcomes after both autologous chondrocyte implantation and microfracture. A defect size of >4 cm(2) was the only factor predictive of better outcomes when autologous chondrocyte implantation was compared with a non-autologous chondrocyte implantation surgical technique.Cartilage repair or restoration in the knee provides short-term success with microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, or osteochondral autograft. There are patient-specific and defect-specific factors that influence clinical outcomes.",0

However, the influence of the localization and the absolute and relative defect size on the clinical outcome has not yet been determined. The purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of the localization and the absolute and relative defect size on the clinical outcome after third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation. Methods A total of 50 patients with cartilage defects of the knee were treated with third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (Novocart® 3D). A match paired analysis was performed of 25 treated femoral and 25 treated patella defects with a follow-up of three years. MRI data was used to do the manual segmentation of the cartilage layer throughout the knee joint. The defect size was determined by taking the defect size measured in the MRI in relation to the whole cartilage area. The clinical outcome was measured by the IKDC score and VAS pre-operatively and after six, 12, 24, and 36 months post-operatively. Results IKDC and VAS scores showed a significant improvement from the baseline in both groups. Femoral cartilage defects showed significantly superior clinical results in the analyzed scores compared to patellar defects. The femoral group improved IKDC from 33.9 (SD 18.1) pre-operatively to 71.5 (SD 17.4) after three years and the VAS from 6.9 (SD 2.9) pre-operatively to 2.4 (SD 2.5) after three years. In the patellar group, IKDC improved from 36.1 (SD 12.6) pre-operatively to 54.7 (SD 20.3) after three years and the VAS improved from 6.7 (SD 2.8) pre-operatively to 3.4 (SD 2.) after three years. Regarding the defect size, results showed that the same absolute defect size at med FC (4.8, range 2–15) and patella (4.6, range 2–12) has a significantly different share of the total cartilaginous size of the joint compartment (med FC: 6.7, range 1.2–13.9; pat: 18.9, range 4.0–47.0). However, there was no significant influence of the relative defect size on the clinical outcome in either patellar or femoral localization. Conclusion Third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation in ACI-treated femoral cartilage defects leads to a superior clinical outcome in a follow-up of three years compared with patellar defects. No significant influence of the defect size was found in either femoral or patellar cartilage defects.",0

The matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI) was developed to repair articular cartilage with an advance on the autologous chondrocyte implant procedure. This study aimed to evaluate whether MACI is a safe and efficacious cartilage repair treatment for patients with knee cartilage lesions. The primary outcomes were the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) domains and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results, compared between baseline and postoperative months 3, 6, 12, and 24. A total of 15 patients (20 knees), with an average age of 33.9 years, had a mean defect size of 4.01 cm(2). By 6-month follow-up, KOOS results demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms and knee-related quality of life. MRI showed significant improvements in four individual graft scoring parameters at 24 months postoperatively. At 24 months, 90% of MACI grafts had filled completely and 10% had good-to-excellent filling of the chondral defect. Most (95%) of the MACI grafts were isointense and 5% were slightly hyperintense. Histologic evaluation at 15 and 24 months showed predominantly hyaline cartilage in newly generated tissue. There were no postoperative complications in any patients and no adverse events related to the MACI operation. This 2-year study has confirmed that MACI is safe and effective with the advantages of a simple technique and significant clinical improvements. Further functional and mechanistic studies with longer follow-up are needed to validate the efficacy and safety of MACI in patients with articular cartilage injuries.",0

Defects were divided into 2 treatment groups: microfracture only (control group) and microfracture covered by a PRF membrane (PRF group). To evaluate the repair cartilage, assessments were performed at 4, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic scoring system and modified Wakitani histologic grading system.The mean ICRS macroscopic scores in the control and PRF groups were 4.1 and 5.8, respectively, at 4 weeks (P = .0623); 6.3 and 9.8, respectively, at 12 weeks (P = .006); and 6.5 and 10.3, respectively, at 24 weeks (P = .010). The mean modified Wakitani scores in the control and PRF groups were 4.0 and 3.9, respectively, at 4 weeks (P > .999); 5.3 and 10.4, respectively, at 12 weeks (P = .006); and 2.6 and 7.4, respectively, at 24 weeks (P = .012).The ICRS macroscopic scores and modified Wakitani scores showed that a single-stage surgical procedure combining microfracture and a PRF membrane was more effective than surgery with only microfracture for promoting cartilage repair.A single-stage surgical procedure combining microfracture and an autologous PRF membrane is a potentially beneficial treatment method for cartilage defects that does not require using any xenocollagen membrane.",0

This study aims to analyze the clinical and histological results after treatment of focal condylar articular lesions of the knee with microfracture and subsequent covering with a resorbable polyglycolic acid/hyaluronan (PGA -HA) matrix augmented with autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMC).Nine patients with focal lesions of the condylar articular cartilage were consecutively treated with arthroscopic PGA -HA-covered microfracture and bone marrow concentrate (PGA -HA-CMBMC). Patients were retrospectively assessed using standardized assessment tools and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five patients consented to undergo second look arthroscopy and 2 consented biopsy harvest.All the patients but one showed improvement in clinical scoring from the pre-operative situation to the latest follow-up (average 22±2months). The mean IKDC subjective score, Lysholm score, VAS and the median Tegner score significantly increased from baseline to the latest follow-up. Cartilage macroscopic assessment at 12months revealed that one repair appeared normal, three almost normal and one appeared abnormal. Histological analysis proofed hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue formation in one case. MRI at 8 to 12months follow-up showed complete defect filling.The first clinical experience with single-stage treatment of focal cartilage defects of the knee with microfracture and covering with the PGA -HA matrix augmented with autologous BMC (PGA -HA-CMBMC) suggests that it is safe, it improves knee function and has the potential to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage.IV, case series.",0

In this Technical Note, we describe a modification of the NAMIC procedure using mosaicplasty trephines to prepare the lesion surface and to shape collagen implants in an all-arthroscopic approach (A-NAMIC). This technique is indicated for the treatment of International Cartilage Repair Society grade III to IV knee chondral lesions of ≤4 cm2. After damaged cartilage is debrided, trephines are used to create a flat, circular lesion surfaces. Subsequently, BMS is performed with nanofracture, eliciting reproducible and stop-controlled subchondral bone perforations of 9-mm depth and 1-mm width. The collagen membrane is then cut to size with the trephine, placed over the prepared defect, and secured with fibrin glue, preventing loss of regenerating cells and growth factors to the joint space. Using trephines allows the rapid and precise creation of smooth defect surfaces with known dimensions, ensuring optimal lesion coverage. Additionally, nanofracture reduces trabecular compaction and allows for a deeper access to subchondral bone in comparison with conventional microfracture, improving lesion filling and production of cartilage with higher hyaline content.",0

Methods 10 men and 30 women aged 22 to 56 (mean, 37.4) years underwent microfracture (n=20) or carbon fibre rod implantation (n=20) for International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 to 4 knee articular cartilage lesions after a mean of 12.2 months of viscosupplementation and physiotherapy. Clinical outcome at 6 and 12 months was assessed using the Tegner-Lysholm score and modified Cincinnati score. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome at 12 months was assessed by a radiologist. The modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was evaluated. Results The 2 groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, lesion location, lesion size, duration of symptoms, and coexisting pathology. The microfracture group had a higher preoperative Tegner-Lysholm score (39.4±7.3 vs. 34.4±4.9, p=0.015) and modified Cincinnati score (36.4±7.2 vs. 30.4±4.0, p=0.002) than the carbon fibre rod group. At 12 months, change in both scores was significant within each group (p&lt;0.001) and was higher in the microfracture than carbon fibre rod group (p&lt;0.001). MRI showed minimal regenerative tissue. Lobulation, oedema, and hypertrophy were more commonly found in the regeneration tissue after carbon fibre rod implantation than microfracture. At 12 months, the MOCART score was higher in the microfracture than carbon fibre rod group (59 vs. 47, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Microfracture is superior to carbon fibre rod implantation in terms of clinical and radiological outcome.",1

Retro-articular and trans-articular drilling of OCD lesions has up to a 33 % failure rate based on complete radiographic healing. Healing may be improved with the delivery of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells into the lesion. We describe a technically simple procedure for retro-articular drilling with the addition of percutaneous iliac crest bone graft placement for stable juvenile OCD lesions of the knee. By using a bone marrow biopsy needle, the bone grafting can be performed in a reproducible manner and in shorter time than in previously described techniques. The proposed technique represents a promising adjunct for the management of stable juvenile OCD lesions that fail to heal after 3-6 months of non-operative treatment and for non-displaced, unstable OCD lesions that undergo internal fixation.

As demonstrated in the past, adult stem cells retain promising clonogenicity. Therefore, we conducted this study to elucidate the effects of cultured autologous chondrogenic satellite cells (CACSCs) compared with subchondral drilling (SCD) for the repair of full-thickness articular cartilage defects.We examined CACSCs isolated from the knee of rabbits using flow cytometry for the expression of stemness and chondrocyte-specific factors. Subsequently, we created a full-thickness cartilage defect model with a diameter of 3 mm and depth of 2 mm on the articular surface of trochlear grooves in the left knee of 24 New Zealand white rabbits. Then we drilled subchondrally through the defect in all animals and stuffed the defects with 10-μg/cm(2) collagen scaffolds. In the treatment group, we instilled CACSCs at 5 × 10(6) cells/mL in the collagen scaffold and collected samples on days 15, 30, and 45.The CACSCs revealed significant expression of CD106, CD44, collagen type 2, and aggrecan. In conjunction with SCD, CACSCs improved healing of the articular cartilage defect, as evidenced by the formation of hyaline-like tissue grossly and histologically. The healed tissue also revealed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the expression of collagen type 2 and aggrecan (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) during the experiment.In conjunction with SCD, CACSCs may be considered to improve articular cartilage damage.",0

Methods Data capture was carried out between 2004 and 2018. Included were patients with cartilage defects of the knee joint with an International Cartilage Repair Society grade of III or higher treated with third-generation ACI who had a minimum follow-up period of 10 years. International Knee Documentation Committee scores and assessment of pain at rest and on movement using visual analog scale scores were captured preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively, as well as annually thereafter. In addition, we performed magnetic resonance imaging examinations in 13 cases after 10 years. The MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) score was used to evaluate the ACI cartilage. Results A total of 54 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 30 reached the 10-year follow-up point and were included in this assessment. At 10 years postoperatively, all clinical outcome parameters showed a statistically significant improvement compared with the preoperative situation, with a responder rate of 70%. The average MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) score after 10 years was 59.2 points (range, 20-100 points), and over 60% of the evaluated patients showed good integration of the implant at 10 years postoperatively. Conclusions The clinical and radiologic findings of this study show that third-generation ACI is a suitable and effective option in the treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee. At 10 years after surgery, third-generation ACI shows stable results and leads to significant improvement in all clinical outcome parameters. Despite these results, revision surgery after third-generation ACI is common and was needed in 23% of patients in this study. Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0

Methods: A total of 30 patients who underwent MF and 20 who received DeNovo NT for JACI-BMAC treatment between 2006 and 2014 were included. Additionally, 17 MF patients received supplemental BMAC treatment. Retrospective chart review was performed and functional outcomes were assessed pre- and postoperatively using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score and Visual Analog pain scale. Postoperative magnetic resonance images were reviewed and evaluated using a modified Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Tissue (MOCART) score. Average follow-up for functional outcomes was 30.9 months (range, 12-79 months). Radiographically, average follow-up was 28.1 months (range, 12-97 months). Results: Both the MF and JACI-BMAC showed significant pre- to postoperative improvements in all Foot and Ankle Outcome Score subscales. Visual Analog Scale scores also showed improvement in both groups, but only reached a level of statistical significance ( P &lt; .05) in the MF group. There were no significant differences in patient reported outcomes between groups. Average osteochondral lesion diameter was significantly larger in JACI-BMAC patients compared to MF patients, but size difference had no significant impact on outcomes. Both groups produced reparative tissue that exhibited a fibrocartilage composition. The JACI-BMAC group had more patients with hypertrophy exhibited on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) than the MF group ( P = .009). Conclusion: JACI-BMAC and MF resulted in improved functional outcomes. However, while the majority of patients improved, functional outcomes and quality of repair tissue were still not normal. Based on our results, lesions repaired with DeNovo NT allograft still appeared fibrocartilaginous on MRI and did not result in significant functional gains as compared to MF.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-016-0969-z,Focal cartilage defects in the knee –a randomized controlled trial comparing autologous chondrocyte implantation with arthroscopic debridement,"Focal cartilage injuries in the knee might have devastating effect due to the predisposition of early onset osteoarthritis. Various surgical treatment options are available, however no statistically significant differences have been found between the different surgical treatments. This supports the suggestion that the improvement might be a result of the post-operative rehabilitation rather than the surgery itself. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has become a recognized treatment option for larger cartilage lesions in the knee. Although ACI has been compared to other surgical treatment such as microfracture and mosaicplasty, it has never been directly compared to simple arthroscopic debridement and rehabilitation alone. In this study we want to increase clinical and economic knowledge about autologous chondrocyte implantation compared to arthroscopic debridement and physical rehabilitation in the short and long run.We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare ACI with simple arthroscopic debridement (AD) and physiotherapy for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee. The study will include a total of 82 patients, both men and non-pregnant women, with a full thickness cartilage defect in the weight bearing area of the femoral condyles or trochlea larger than 2 cm2. The lesion must be symptomatic, with a Lysholm score less than 75. The two treatment groups will receive identical rehabilitation protocol according to a modification of Wondrasch et al., which is an active rehabilitation and education program divided into 3 phases: accommodation, rehabilitation and return to activity. The patients will be followed for 24 months, with additional late follow-ups at 5 and 10 years to monitor the potential onset of osteoarthtitis. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in the KOOS knee-related quality of life (QoL) subscore in the ACI group compared to the AD group at 2 years. A combination of self-explanatory questionnaires, clinical parameters, clinical hop tests and radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used as secondary endpoints.This is the first study with a high level of evidence to compare ACI with simple debridement and physiotherapy for the treatment of isolated symptomatic full thickness lesions of the knee.ClinicalTrial NCT02636881 (21 December 2015).",1

Inadequate healing in areas of weight bearing leads to impairment in load transmission and these defects predispose to later development of osteoarthritis. Surgical management of full thickness chondral defects include arthroscopic microfracture and when appropriate autologous chondrocyte implantation. This latter method however is technically challenging, and may not offer significant improvement over microfracture. Preclinical and limited clinical trials have indicated the capacity of mesenchymal stem cells to influence chondral repair. The aim of this paper is to describe the methodology of a pilot randomised controlled trial comparing arthroscopic microfracture alone for isolated knee chondral defects versus arthroscopic microfracture combined with postoperative autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell injections.A pilot single-centre randomised controlled trial is proposed. 40 participants aged 18-50 years, with isolated femoral condyle chondral defects and awaiting planned arthroscopic microfracture will be randomly allocated to a control group (receiving no additional treatment) or treatment group (receiving postoperative adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell treatment). Primary outcome measures will include MRI assessment of cartilage volume and defects and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Secondary outcomes will include further MRI assessment of bone marrow lesions, bone area and T2 cartilage mapping, a 0-10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale, a Global Impression of Change score and a treatment satisfaction scale. Adverse events and cointerventions will be recorded. Initial outcome follow-up for publication of results will be at 12 months. Further annual follow-up to assess long-term differences between the two group will occur.This trial has received prospective ethics approval through the Latrobe University Human Research Ethics Committee.

The restoration of articular congruence is crucial to avoid the progression to osteoarthritis (OA). Purpose: To describe the autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) “segmental-sandwich” technique for restoration of the osteochondral unit and to evaluate midterm outcomes in patients treated with this procedure. Correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiographic findings with outcomes were assessed. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Outcomes were evaluated for a consecutive cohort of 15 patients with symptomatic deep (&gt;8 mm) osteochondral lesions who underwent autologous bone grafting plus the ACI segmental-sandwich technique performed by a single surgeon between 2003 and 2011. Patients with a minimum 2-year follow-up were included. All patients completed validated clinical outcome scales and a patient satisfaction survey. The Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade was assessed for the progression to OA. The repair site was evaluated with the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score. Filling and tissue characteristics of the bone defect were analyzed with MRI. Results: All patients (mean age at surgery, 31.0 ± 9.1 years) were available for follow-up (mean follow-up, 7.8 ± 3.0 years; range, 2-15 years). The mean chondral lesion size was 6.0 ± 3.5 cm 2 (range, 1.5-13.5 cm 2 ), with a mean bone defect area of 1.7 cm 2 (27%-40% of overall surface area treated by ACI) and depth of 1.0 cm. All patients had successful clinical outcomes, and all functional scores improved significantly ( P &lt; .05). Patients reported a very high satisfaction rate (93%). The K-L grade demonstrated no significant progression to OA over a mean follow-up of 4.7 years. For 12 patients with MRI results available, the mean MOCART score at a mean of 3.3 years was 64.2 ± 19.9, with complete or near-complete (≥75% of defect volume) chondral defect filling (83%) and complete integration to adjacent cartilage (83%). Bone defects were completely filled in 83% of patients. Conclusion: The ACI segmental-sandwich technique provides significant functional improvements at midterm follow-up and excellent survival rates. This unique treatment allows for the resurfacing of cartilage defects and the repair of underlying segmental bone lesions.",0

This report was undertaken to investigate 5-year structural and clinical outcomes. Design The international randomized controlled trial enrolled 80 patients, aged 18 to 55 years, with grade III or IV focal lesions on the femoral condyles. Patients were randomized to receive BST-CarGel® treatment or microfracture alone, and followed standardized 12-week rehabilitation. Co-primary endpoints of repair tissue quantity and quality were evaluated by 3-dimensional MRI quantification of the degree of lesion filling (%) and T2 relaxation times. Secondary endpoints were clinical benefit measured with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) questionnaires and safety. General estimating equations were used for longitudinal statistical analysis of repeated measures. Results Blinded MRI analysis demonstrated that BST-CarGel®-treated patients showed a significantly greater treatment effect for lesion filling ( P = 0.017) over 5 years compared with microfracture alone. A significantly greater treatment effect for BST-CarGel® was also found for repair tissue T2 relaxation times ( P = 0.026), which were closer to native cartilage compared to the microfracture group. BST-CarGel® and microfracture groups showed highly significant improvement at 5 years from pretreatment baseline for each WOMAC subscale ( P &lt; 0.0001), and there were no differences between the treatment groups. Safety was comparable for both groups. Conclusions BST-CarGel® was shown to be an effective mid-term cartilage repair treatment. At 5 years, BST-CarGel® treatment resulted in sustained and significantly superior repair tissue quantity and quality over microfracture alone. Clinical benefit following BST-CarGel® and microfracture treatment were highly significant over baseline levels.",1

Methods The study used magnetic resonance imaging data as the basis for construction of the titanium implant using a three-dimensional printing technique. This was then placed on the medial condyle of the knee joint in eight sheep and left in place in vivo over a period of six months. Following euthanasia, the local biological response was analyzed using micro-computed tomography, light microscopy and histological evaluation (International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score). The variables were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. Odds ratios were given with 95% confidence intervals. Results The osseointegration rate was 62.1% (SD 3.9%). All implants were prone to the neighboring cartilage bed (4.4–1096.1 μm). Using the IRCS score, the elements ‘surface’, ‘matrix’, ‘cell distribution’ and ‘cell population’ all showed pathological changes on the operated side, although these did not correlate with implant elevation. On average, a difference of 0.7 mm (± 2 mm) was found between the digitally planned implant and the real implant. Conclusions As a result of imprecise segmentation and difficult preparation conditions at the prosthesis bed, as well as changes at the surface of the implant over the operational lifetime of the prosthesis, it must be stated that the approach implemented here of using a customized implant for the treatment of focal full-thickness cartilage defects at the knee did not meet our expectations.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9081017,Disease-Modifying Potential of Metformin and Alendronate in an Experimental Mouse Model of Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease causing progressive damages of the cartilage and subchondral bone, synovial inflammation, and severe pain. Despite the complex pathomorphological changes that occur in OA, the approach to different forms of OA is standardized. The global results from pharmacological treatment are not satisfactory. Hence, this study aimed to explore the effects of metformin, alendronate, and their combination on OA development and progression in mice with collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA). Female ICR (CD-2) mice were randomized to five groups: control group, CIOA untreated, CIOA + metformin, CIOA + alendronate, and CIOA + metformin + alendronate. OA was induced by the intra-articular (i.a.) injection of collagenase. OA phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry (bone marrow cell differentiation), ELISA (serum levels of the adipokines leptin and resistin), and histology (pathological changes of the knee joint). Treatment with metformin, alendronate, or their combination inhibited the expression of RANK and RANKL on osteoblasts and osteoclasts obtained by ex vivo cultivation of bone marrow cells in mineralization or osteoclastogenic media. In addition, metformin treatment was effective for the attenuation of fibroblast differentiation, but not of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), while alendronate had an opposite effect. The combination of metformin and alendronate had a suppressive effect on both MSCs and fibroblasts differentiation. Treatment with metformin, alendronate, and their combination decreased serum concentrations of leptin and resistin in the chronic phase of arthritis. The histopathological examination showed that compared with the untreated CIOA group (OA score 9), the groups treated with metformin (OA score 4) or alendronate (OA score 6) had lower scores for cartilage changes. Metformin combined with alendronate significantly decreased the degree of cartilage degeneration (OA score 2), suggesting that this combination might be a useful approach for the treatment of OA patients.",0

Autologous osteochondral transplantation has been viewed as an alternative choice for treating these lesions, but donor-site morbidity has limited its application. Excellent clinical outcomes have been shown in repairing these types of lesions with autologous osteoperiosteal grafts, and these outcomes are achieved at a low cost and without donor-site morbidity in the normal knee joint. This will be the first randomised controlled trial to compare the two surgical techniques, and recommendations for the treatment of patients with large cystic OLTs will be provided. Methods and analysis A non-inferiority randomised controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 70 participants with clinically diagnosed large cystic OLTs will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group or the control group at a ratio of 1:1. The experimental group will be treated with autologous osteoperiosteal cylinder graft transplantation, while the control group will be treated with autologous osteochondral transplantation. The primary outcome measure will be the American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Score and the Short Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures will include the secondary arthroscopy International Cartilage Repair Society score, the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score, the Tegner activity level score, the visual analogue scale, routine X-rays, CT and complications. These parameters will be evaluated preoperatively, as well as at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 months postoperatively. In this trial, we hypothesised that both procedures offer good results for the treatment of patients with large cystic OLTs, and occurrence of donor-site morbidity in autologous osteoperiosteal cylinder graft transplantation group is less than that in autologous osteochondral transplantation group.

The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of BMDMSCs to an autologous platelet-enriched fibrin (APEF) scaffold enhances chondral repair compared with APEF alone.A 15-mm-diameter full-thickness chondral defect was created on the lateral trochlear ridge of both stifle joints of twelve adult horses. In each animal, one defect was randomly assigned to receive APEF+BMDMSCs and the contralateral defect received APEF alone. Repair tissues were evaluated one year later with arthroscopy, histological examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and biomechanical testing.The arthroscopic findings, MRI T2 map, histological scores, structural stiffness, and material stiffness were similar (p > 0.05) between the APEF and APEF+BMDMSC-treated repairs at one year. Ectopic bone was observed within the repair tissue in four of twelve APEF+BMDMSC-treated defects. Defects repaired with APEF alone had less trabecular bone edema (as seen on MRI) compared with defects repaired with APEF+BMDMSCs. Micro-CT analysis showed thinner repair tissue in defects repaired with APEF+BMDMSCs than in those treated with APEF alone (p < 0.05).APEF alone resulted in thicker repair tissue than was seen with APEF+BMDMSCs. The addition of BMDMSCs to APEF did not enhance cartilage repair and stimulated bone formation in some cartilage defects.APEF supported repair of critical-size full-thickness chondral defects in horses, which was not improved by the addition of BMDMSCs. This work supports further investigation to determine whether APEF enhances cartilage repair in humans.",0

In the control group (CG), defects were left untreated. In the early-(ETG) and late-(LTG) treatment groups, defects were treated by an osteoperiosteal graft 1 and 12 weeks, respectively, after the index procedure. Synovial fluid (SF) samples were collected regularly and proteoglycan fragments (PF), total collagen (TC) and collagenase (MMP-1) levels were measured. Rabbits were killed at 4 (early period), 12 (intermediate period), or 24 (late period) weeks postoperatively. Histological examination indicated a more successful healing in both grafting groups than in the CG, but without any difference at any time period between the grafting groups. In the CG, PF, and TC levels in SF increased continuously until the late period, indicating an ongoing degenerative activity in the joints. In contrast, SF marker levels in both grafting groups indicated that normalization in joint metabolism could be achieved-at least partially-after treatment. However, PF levels in the SF showed that the treatment of defects in earlier stages might result in better outcomes since the negative effects were more prominent in chronic stages, presumably due to the more prolonged period of disturbed homeostasis. Thus, histological values and SF marker levels indicated that treatment of osteochondral defects at any time of the disease had a positive effect on healing when compared to no treatment. Early treatment might better assist the recovery of joint homeostasis than late treatment.",0

Case series study. Patients with knee OA Kellgren Lawrence (K-L) grade II and III received 1 injection of BM MNC. The clinical results were analyzed with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Knee Society Score (KSS) before, 3, 6, and 12 months after injection. Radiological evaluation was performed with a calibrated x-ray and the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and 6 to 7 months postinjection. Results A total of 34 knees were treated with BM MNC injections. Mean (±SD) age of patient group was 53.96 ± 14.15 years; there were 16 males, 16 females, KL grade II, 16; KL grade III, 18. The average injected count of BM MNCs was 45.56 ± 34.94 × 10 6 cells. At the endpoint of 12 months 65% of patients still had minimal perceptible clinical improvement of the KOOS total score. The mean improvement of KOOS total score was +15.3 and of the KSS knee score was +21.45 and the function subscale +27.08 ( P &lt; 0.05) points. The Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) improved from 44.31 to 42.93 points ( P &lt; 0.05). No adverse effects after the BM-MNC injection were observed. Conclusions The single dose BM MNC partially reduces clinical signs of the knee osteoarthritis stage II/III and in some cases, decreases degenerative changes in the joint building tissue over 12-month period.",0
https://doi.org/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b00483,Codelivery of Synovium-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells and TGF-β by a Hybrid Scaffold for Cartilage Regeneration,"Synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) are attractive tissue-specific cells for cartilage regeneration because of their easy availability, higher chondrogenic potential, and joint specificity. In the present study, we established a hybrid scaffold to codeliver SMSCs and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which can integrate the scaffolds, the growth factor, and the autogenous cells within rabbit cartilage defects. A chitosan hydrogel and a decellularized bone matrix were used to fabricate the gel-solid duplex phase biomaterials, which were proven to retain more cells, promote tissue integration, and provide mechanical support. In vitro experiments demonstrated that this hybrid scaffold could release TGF-β in a controlled biphasic pattern, which can promote cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of loaded rabbit SMSCs. For in vivo experiments, we filled cartilage defects with the hybrid materials, delivering autogenous SMSCs and TGF-β simultaneously via chitosan's sol-gel transition. Histological analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and nanoindentation assessment indicated superior cartilage regeneration using this codelivery system compared with that from routine microfracture or control delivery scaffolds. Beyond cartilage regeneration, the easy preparation, favorable biophysical properties, and controlled release ability make this codelivery system applicable to transport other tissue-specific cells or biofactors for tissue engineering.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2016.07.010,A Comparison of the Outcomes for Cartilage Defects of the Knee Treated With Biologic Resurfacing Versus Focal Metallic Implants,"To compare the results of focal metallic resurfacing with biologic procedures in patients more than 35 years of age with isolated, full thickness defects of the femoral condyle.A total of 61 patients met the selection criteria resulting in 30 patients treated with biological procedures, including debridement, microfracture, osteochondral autograft transplantation, osteochondral allograft, and autologous chondrocyte implantation (BIO group), and 32 patients treated with focal metallic resurfacing (CAP group). The BIO and CAP groups were matched according to treatment location, defect grade and size, and age profile. Outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Short Form-12, and satisfaction. The primary combination endpoint was determined as a 20% improvement (minimum clinically important difference-20) on WOMAC pain and function at 2 years and no additional index lesion-related surgical intervention. Safety and effectiveness were also reported.Thirty patients in the BIO group (mean age of 44.6, range 35-64) had an average follow-up of 2.6 years and 32 patients in the CAP group (mean age 47.9, range 37-68) were followed for 2.0 years. Fifty-three percent in the BIO group and 75% in the CAP group achieved success per the endpoint definition. The mean total WOMAC score improved significantly for both groups (BIO: 57-78; P < .001) (CAP: 41-86; P < .001). The physical component score (Short Form-12 PCS) improved significantly in the CAP group only (30-36.4; P < .001). Good to excellent patient satisfaction was achieved by 80% in BIO and 91% in CAP. There were 4 secondary procedures on the index lesion in the BIO group and 2 in the CAP group.Careful patient selection can achieve high satisfaction rates with both biological and focal metal resurfacing procedures for the treatment of isolated focal chondral lesions of the femoral condyle in the knee. Focal metallic resurfacing results in similar clinical outcomes and provides excellent success rates at short-term follow-up.Level III comparative study.",1
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20071545,Chondrocyte Culture Parameters for Matrix-Assisted Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation Affect Catabolism and Inflammation in a Rabbit Model,"Cartilage defects represent an increasing pathology among active individuals that affects the ability to contribute to sports and daily life. Cell therapy, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), is a widespread option to treat larger cartilage defects still lacking standardization of in vitro cell culture parameters. We hypothesize that mRNA expression of cytokines and proteases before and after ACI is influenced by in vitro parameters: cell-passage, cell-density and membrane-holding time. Knee joint articular chondrocytes, harvested from rabbits (n = 60), were cultured/processed under varying conditions: after three different cell-passages (P1, P3, and P5), cells were seeded on 3D collagen matrices (approximately 25 mm3) at three different densities (2 × 105/matrix, 1 × 106/matrix, and 3 × 106/matrix) combined with two different membrane-holding times (5 h and two weeks) prior autologous transplantation. Those combinations resulted in 18 different in vivo experimental groups. Two defects/knee/animal were created in the trochlear groove (defect dimension: ∅ 4 mm × 2 mm). Four identical cell-seeded matrices (CSM) were assembled and grouped in two pairs: One pair giving pre-operative in vitro data (CSM-i), the other pair was implanted in vivo and harvested 12 weeks post-implantation (CSM-e). CSMs were analyzed for TNF-α, IL-1β, MMP-1, and MMP-3 via qPCR. CSM-i showed higher expression of IL-1β, MMP-1, and MMP-3 compared to CSM-e. TNF-α expression was higher in CSM-e. Linearity between CSM-i and CSM-e values was found, except for TNF-α. IL-1β expression was higher in CSM-i at higher passage and longer membrane-holding time. IL-1β expression decreased with prolonged membrane-holding time in CSM-e. For TNF-α, the reverse was true. Lower cell-passages and lower membrane-holding time resulted in stronger TNF-α expression. Prolonged membrane-holding time resulted in increased MMP levels among CSM-i and CSM-e. Cellular density was of no significant effect. We demonstrated cytokine and MMP expression levels to be directly influenced by in vitro culture settings in ACI. Linearity of expression-patterns between CSM-i and CSM-e may predict ACI regeneration outcome in vivo. Cytokine/protease interaction within the regenerate tissue could be guided via adjusting in vitro culture parameters, of which membrane-holding time resulted the most relevant one.",0
https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.931725,Quality of Newly Formed Cartilaginous Tissue in Defects of Articular Surface after Transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a Composite Scaffold Based on Collagen I with Chitosan Micro- and Nanofibres,"The aim of this study was to evaluate macroscopically, histologically and immunohistochemically the quality of newly formed tissue in iatrogenic defects of articular cartilage of the femur condyle in miniature pigs treated with the clinically used method of microfractures in comparison with the transplantation of a combination of a composite scaffold with allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or the composite scaffold alone. The newly formed cartilaginous tissue filling the defects of articular cartilage after transplantation of the scaffold with MSCs (Group A) had in 60 % of cases a macroscopically smooth surface. In all lesions after the transplantation of the scaffold alone (Group B) or after the method of microfractures (Group C), erosions/fissures or osteophytes were found on the surface. The results of histological and immunohistochemical examination using the modified scoring system according to O’Driscoll were as follows: 14.7±3.82 points after transplantations of the scaffold with MSCs (Group A); 5.3±2.88 points after transplantations of the scaffold alone (Group B); and 5.2±0.64 points after treatment with microfractures (Group C). The O’Driscoll score in animals of Group A was significantly higher than in animals of Group B or Group C (p&lt;0.0005 both). No significant difference was found in the O’Driscoll score between Groups B and C. The treatment of iatrogenic lesions of the articular cartilage surface on the condyles of femur in miniature pigs using transplantation of MSCs in the composite scaffold led to the filling of defects by a tissue of the appearance of hyaline cartilage. Lesions treated by implantation of the scaffold alone or by the method of microfractures were filled with fibrous cartilage with worse macroscopic, histological and immunohistochemial indicators.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5130152,Coculture of hWJMSCs and pACs in Oriented Scaffold Enhances Hyaline Cartilage Regeneration <i>In Vitro</i>,"Seed cells of articular cartilage tissue engineering face many obstacles in their application because of the dedifferentiation of chondrocytes or unstable chondrogenic differentiation status of pluripotent stem cells. To overcome mentioned dilemmas, a simulation of the articular cartilage microenvironment was constructed by primary articular cartilage cells (pACs) and acellular cartilage extracellular matrix- (ACECM-) oriented scaffold cocultured with human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJMSCs) in vitro. The coculture groups showed more affluent cartilage special matrix ingredients including collagen II and aggrecan based on the results of histological staining and western blotting and cut down as many pACs as possible. The RT-PCR and cell viability experiments also demonstrated that hWJMSCs were successfully induced to differentiate into chondrocytes when cultured in the simulated cartilage microenvironment, as confirmed by the significant upregulation of collagen II and aggrecan, while the cell proliferation activity of pACs was significantly improved by cell-cell interactions. Therefore, compared with monoculture and chondrogenic induction of inducers, coculture providing a simulated native articular microenvironment was a potential and temperate way to regulate the biological behaviors of pACs and hWJMSCs to regenerate the hyaline articular cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2020.115520,Developmental engineering of living implants for deep osteochondral joint surface defects,"Abstract Introduction The repair of deep osteochondral joint surface defects represents a significant unmet clinical need. Importantly, untreated lesions lead to a high rate of osteoarthritis. The current strategies to repair these defects include osteochondral autograft transplantation or “sandwich” strategies combining bone autografts with autologous chondrocyte implantation, with poorly documented long-term outcomes. In this study, we first investigated the capacity of juvenile osteochondral grafts (OCGs) to repair osteochondral defects in skeletally mature rats. With this regenerative model in view, we produced a new biological, bilayered and scaffold-free Tissue Engineered construct (bTEC) for the repair of a deep osteochondral defect of the rat knee. Methods Cylindrical OCGs were excised from the femoral intercondylar groove of the knee of skeletally immature rats (5 weeks) and transplanted into osteochondral defects created in skeletally mature rats (11 weeks). To create bTECs, micromasses (μMasses) of human periosteum-derived progenitor cells (hPDCs) and human articular chondrocytes (hACs) were produced in vitro using previously optimized chemically defined medium formulations containing growth and differentiation factors including bone morphogenetic proteins. These two μMass types were subsequently implanted as bilayered constructs into osteochondral defects in nude rats. At 4 and 16 weeks after surgery, the knees were collected and processed for subsequent 3D imaging analysis and histological evaluation. Micro-computed tomography (μCT), H&E, and Safranin O staining were used to evaluate the degree and quality of tissue repair. Results The osteochondral unit of the knee joint in 5 weeks old rats exhibits an immature phenotype, displaying active subchondral bone formation through endochondral ossification and the absence of a tidemark. When transplanted into skeletally mature animals, the immature OCGs resumed their maturation process, i.e., formed new subchondral bone, established the tidemark, and maintained their Safranin O-positive hyaline cartilage at 16 weeks after transplantation. The bTECs (hPDCs + hACs) could partially recapitulate the biology as seen with the immature OCGs, including the formation of the joint surface architecture with typical zonation, ranging from non-mineralized hyaline cartilage in the superficial layers to a progressively mineralized matrix at the interface with a new subchondral bone plate. Conclusions Cell-based TE constructs mimicking immature OCGs and displaying a hierarchically organized structure comprising of different tissue forming units seem an attractive strategy to treat deep osteochondral defects of the knee.",0
,"Current strategies for nonsurgical, arthroscopic, and minimally invasive surgical treatment of knee cartilage pathology","The current approaches to treating articular cartilage defects in the knee comprise a spectrum from pharmacologic therapies to total knee arthroplasty. Nonsurgical treatment can include anti-inflammatory medications, bracing, and physical therapy. Surgical treatments include reconstructive repair of a small or large defect using microfracture, osteochondral autograft transplantation, autologous chrondrocyte transplantation, or osteochondral allograft transplantation; realignment procedures including osteotomies; and unicompartmental arthroplasty. A comprehensive algorithm can be used to determine the appropriate treatment for knee defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546517691942,Collagen Augmentation Improves the Quality of Cartilage Repair After Microfracture in Patients Undergoing High Tibial Osteotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: The quality of cartilage repair after marrow stimulation is unpredictable. To overcome the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, various augmentation techniques have been developed. However, their efficacies remain unclear. Hypothesis: The quality of cartilage repair and clinical outcomes would be superior in patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with microfracture and collagen augmentation compared to those undergoing HTO with microfracture alone without collagen augmentation for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Twenty-eight patients undergoing HTO were randomized into 2 groups: microfracture alone (group 1, n = 14) or microfracture with collagen augmentation (group 2, n = 14). At 1 year postoperatively, second-look arthroscopic surgery and biopsy of repaired cartilage were performed at the time of HTO plate removal. Biopsy specimens were graded using the International Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale II (ICRS II). In addition, imaging outcomes in terms of the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score were assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, clinical outcomes in terms of the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity scale score were evaluated. Results: The mean ICRS II score in group 2 was significantly higher than that in group 1 (1053.2 vs 885.4, respectively; P = .002). Group 2 showed greater improvement in tissue morphology, cell morphology, surface architecture, middle/deep zone assessment, and overall assessment compared with group 1 ( P &lt; .050 for all comparisons). Imaging outcomes based on the MOCART score were superior in group 2 compared to those in group 1 on MRI at 1 year postoperatively (64.6 vs 45.4, respectively; P = .001). The degree of defect repair was better in group 2 than in group 1 ( P = .040). Clinical outcomes in terms of the VAS for pain score, KOOS, IKDC score, and Tegner activity scale score were improved in both groups without between-group differences ( P &gt; .100 for all comparisons). Conclusion: The quality of cartilage repair after microfracture with collagen augmentation was superior to that after microfracture alone in patients undergoing HTO. Clinical results after 1 year did not reflect this difference in tissue repair. Therefore, a longer follow-up of the cohort is needed to answer this question.",1
https://doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2013-0045,A Systematic Review of Reporting of Rehabilitation in Articular-Cartilage-Repair Studies of Third-Generation Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in the Knee,"Context: Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a tissue-engineered surgical technique initially developed for articular cartilage repair of isolated chondral lesions of the knee. Third-generation techniques (ACI3) are now available that deliver autologous cultured chondrocytes into the defect using cell scaffolds. The successful outcomes of these techniques have some dependency on presurgical and postsurgical patient rehabilitation. Objectives: To determine if the standard of reporting for rehabilitation has improved in ACI3 studies; previous reviews in this field recommended describing the detail of this rehabilitation and patient compliance as integral elements. Evidence Acquisition: A computerized search was performed in March 2013. Criteria for inclusion were any studies that evaluated or described the process of ACI3 in the knee and subsequent rehabilitation. The modified Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) was used to rate the standard of reporting of rehabilitation and surgical procedures; review articles were also evaluated for quality using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT). Mean scores, odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and Mann-Whitney U statistics were calculated. Evidence Synthesis: An improvement in mean CMS was seen compared with previous reviews, but rehabilitation reporting scores were lower than their surgical equivalent; significant association was seen between studies with rehabilitator involvement and high scores in the individual CMS rehabilitation element. Predominant SORT scores of 2A indicated medium strength of recommendation. Conclusions: The CMS provides a general overview of methodological quality, but a more specialized tool to report on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the rehabilitation process would help raise the standards. It is recommended that rehabilitation therapists be included as key members of research teams and be involved in the design, implementation, and reporting of future studies.",0

Hounsfield unit (HU) readings were obtained at the synthetic implant, transplanted autograft plug, soft-tissue, cancellous bone, and cortical bone sites. The implant site material was graded by an established ossification quality score (range, 1 to 4).Nine patients underwent CT scans at intervals ranging from 2 to 63 months after surgery. This sequence of images tracked the potential development of bone ingrowth activity. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete autograft bone plug healing. The synthetic implant site CT scans showed a drop in density from 84 HU at 4 months to 19 HU by 13 months (fibrous scar density). The ossification quality score for all synthetic implants was 1 (tract filled with soft-tissue density) instead of 4 (cancellous bone). The transplanted autograft plug densities were consistent with and completely incorporated into the adjacent cancellous bone.The synthetic multiphase implant showed no evidence of bone ingrowth, osteoconductivity, or ossification. The implant density declined over time to that of fibrous scar. This synthetic plug does not provide subchondral structural support for any tissue that grows over it. This study does not support the use of this implant for the primary repair of articular cartilage lesions.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2019.08.043,Preoperative Validation of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System in Patients With Articular Cartilage Defects of the Knee,"To validate the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function computer adaptive test (PF CAT) with current patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments in patients with cartilage injuries of the knee.Patients scheduled for osteochondral autograft or allograft transplant, microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation, allograft cartilage resurfacing, and chondroplasty were prospectively enrolled in the study and completed PROMIS PF CAT, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS activities of daily living, pain, symptoms, sport, and quality of life), Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36 physical function [PF] and Physical Component Summary), and EuroQol-5 Dimension questionnaires. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to compare instruments. Instrument correlations were defined as excellent (>0.7), excellent to good (0.61-0.69), good (0.4 to 0.6), and poor (<0.39), with significance defined as P < .05.A total of 293 knees in 275 patients (54.5% male) undergoing 319 cartilage procedures were analyzed. The most commonly performed cartilage procedure was chondroplasty (n = 118; 37.0%), followed by microfracture (n = 100; 31.3%). The mean age was 34.0 ± 14.7 and the mean body mass index was 30.0 ± 6.9. The PROMIS PF CAT had an excellent correlation with the SF-36 PF (r = 0.819; P < .001), SF-36 Physical Component Summary (r = 0.766; P < .001), KOOS activities of daily living (r = 0.733; P < .001), KOOS Sport (r = 0.709; P < .001), and EuroQol-5 Dimension (r = 0.752; P < .001) instruments; an excellent-good correlation with the KOOS pain (r = 0.662; P < .001), and KOOS quality of life (r = 0.640; P < .001) scores; and a good correlation with the KOOS symptoms (r = 0.519; P < .001) scale. The PROMIS PF CAT had no floor or ceiling effects and the smallest question burden (mean 4.17 ± 0.93 questions). Dimensionality analyses demonstrated that the smallest amount of unexplained variance was present in the PROMIS PF CAT (3.6%).The PROMIS PF CAT is an effective tool for preoperative outcome assessment in patients with cartilage defects of the knee. It correlates strongly with legacy PRO measures of physical function with no ceiling and floor effects and a minimal time burden for completion. Further study is warranted to determine postoperative performance and to evaluate the responsiveness of PROMIS to change within a patient.III; Prognostic retrospective comparative study.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/aoj.2018.06.08,"Review of an exploratory phase II FDA regulated clinical trial of a novel surgical innovation: completion of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare NeoCart with the standard-of-care, microfracture, for articular cartilage repair","Background: Full thickness articular cartilage lesions cause significant morbidity, and surgical intervention is frequently applied to restore the joint surface. Current approaches of cartilage restoration have not proven to produce hyaline cartilage and have limited clinical longevity. The objective of the current study was to evaluate a novel autologous cartilage tissue implant, NeoCart, at the conclusion of the FDA-regulated exploratory phase II randomized, prospective clinical trial. The primary surgical standard-of-care, microfracture, was set by the FDA as the control. Objectives included parameter setting for the phase III trial while conducting a preliminary long-term evaluation of safety and efficacy.  Methods: Patients were randomized 2:1 to NeoCart (n=21) or microfracture (n=9) surgical intervention at time of arthroscopy. Baseline demographics and patient-reported outcomes were established including: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC); Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) components including Pain, Activity of Daily Living, Quality of Life, Symptoms, Sports & Recreation; Short Form 36; and Visual Analog Scale Pain. Adverse events (AEs), range of motion, and patient reported outcomes were assessed annually for 5 years.  Results: The treatment and control groups did not significantly differ in age, gender distribution, symptom duration, lesion size, or baseline patient reported outcomes aside from pre-surgical Visual Analog Scale Pain scores and KOOS Sports and Recreation. AE rates did not differ between treatments. The control group had greater loss to follow-up over a 5-year period. Change from baseline was significantly greater for NeoCart than for microfracture for primary end points; IKDC (1, 2 years) and KOOS Pain (1, 3, 4 years), and secondary end points; KOOS Quality of Life, Symptoms, and Sports & Recreation until 4 years. At 5 years, IKDC, KOOS Pain, Activities of Daily Living, and Quality of Life, and Short Form 36 Physical scores for both treatments improved significantly (P<0.05). Improvements for NeoCart were sustained earlier and throughout the entire study period.  Conclusions: NeoCart implantation has a safety and efficacy profile supporting further consideration of this therapy in a confirmatory phase III trial for establishment as a primary cartilage injury treatment. While clinical trials for surgical interventions depend on comparison with a standard-of-care, the favorability of the control procedure, microfracture, varied over the study duration. The known short duration of microfracture’s therapeutic effect was likely associated with high loss to follow-up in the small control group. Although adequate for setting phase III parameters, this study is under-powered to clearly attribute differences in longer term efficacy. Nonetheless, preliminary results demonstrate that NeoCart may provide an alternative primary surgical option for cartilage injury with a more rapid onset of action than microfracture.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.b.34672,In vitro and in vivo study on the osseointegration of BCP‐coated versus uncoated nondegradable thermoplastic polyurethane focal knee resurfacing implants,"Focal knee resurfacing implants (FKRIs) are intended to treat cartilage defects in middle-aged patients. Most FKRIs are metal-based, which hampers follow-up of the joint using magnetic resonance imaging and potentially leads to damage of the opposing cartilage. The purpose of this study was to develop a nondegradable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) FKRI and investigate its osseointegration. Different surface roughness modifications and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) coating densities were first tested in vitro on TPU discs. The in vivo osseointegration of BCP-coated TPU implants was subsequently compared to uncoated TPU implants and the titanium bottom layer of metal control implants in a caprine model. Implants were implanted bilaterally in stifle joints and animals were followed for 12 weeks, after which the bone-to-implant contact area (BIC) was assessed. Additionally, 18F-sodium-fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography PET/CT-scans were obtained at 3 and 12 weeks to visualize the bone metabolism over time. The BIC was significantly higher for the BCP-coated TPU implants compared to the uncoated TPU implants (p = .03), and did not significantly differ from titanium (p = .68). Similar 18F-NaF tracer uptake patterns were observed between 3 and 12 weeks for the BCP-coated TPU and titanium implants, but not for the uncoated implants. TPU FKRIs with surface modifications could provide the answer to the drawbacks of metal FKRIs.",0

Fifty-seven patients (29 men, 28 women) with osteochondral lesions of the talus were included in this prospective randomized clinical study between the years 2003 and 2009. The patients were treated with arthroscopic debridement and microfracture technique. Randomly selected 41 patients were injected intra-articular hyaluronan (injection group). The remaining 16 patients did not receive postoperative injection (non-injection group). Assessment of the pain and functional outcomes was performed using the Freiburg and AOFAS ankle/hindfoot scoring systems. In the injection group, the mean postoperative Freiburg functional and pain scores were significantly higher compared to preoperative functional and pain scores (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). Similarly, for the patients in non-injection group, the mean postoperative Freiburg functional and pain scores were significantly higher compared to preoperative functional and pain scores (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). The AOFAS functional and pain scores of the patients in the injection group were significantly higher (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001) postoperatively compared to preoperative scores. Scoring the patients in the non-injection group according to AOFAS system also revealed significantly higher (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001) postoperative functional and pain scores over preoperative scores. The increase in the postoperative scores was found to be significantly higher in the injection group compared to non-injection group in both Freiburg and AOFAS systems (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). Treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus using microfracture technique significantly improved functional and pain scores postoperatively. Additional treatment with intra-articular hyaluronan injection as an adjunct to microfracture technique may offer better clinical outcomes over microfracture technique alone.

https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620x.86b7.14941,Osteochondral autologous transplantation for the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects of the shoulder,"We performed eight osteochondral autologous transplantations from the knee joint to the shoulder. All patients (six men, two women; mean age 43.1 years) were documented prospectively. In each patient the stage of the osteochondral lesion was Outerbridge grade IV with a mean size of the affected area of 150 mm 2 . All patients were assessed by using the Constant score for the shoulder and the Lysholm score for the knee. Standard radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and second-look arthroscopy were used to assess the presence of glenohumeral osteoarthritis and the integrity of the grafts. After a mean of 32.6 months (8 to 47), the mean Constant score increased significantly. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed good osseointegration of the osteochondral plugs and congruent articular cartilage at the transplantation site in all but one patient. Second-look arthroscopy performed in two cases revealed a macroscopically good integration of the autograft with an intact articular surface. Osteochondral autologous transplantation in the shoulder appears to offer good clinical results for treating full-thickness osteochondral lesions of the glenohumeral joint. However, our study suggests that the development of osteoarthritis and the progression of pre-existing osteoarthritic changes cannot be altered by this technique.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546513489262,Influence of Sex on the Outcome of Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in Chondral Defects of the Knee,"Background: Sex-specific outcomes have been reported in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction as well as in osteoarthrosis progression, but there are currently no related published data on autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The present prospective study was performed to investigate sex-dependent differences in the results after ACI. Hypothesis: The clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results after ACI of the knee are influenced by the patient’s sex. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: The midterm clinical and MRI results of a cell-based fibrin-polymer graft for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects were evaluated preoperatively and 6, 12, and 48 months after surgery in 52 patients (male:female ratio, 25:27; average age, 35.6 years). Depending on the sex and the location of the defects (femoral condyles, n = 32; patellofemoral compartment, n = 20), patients were assigned to 4 different groups. Baseline clinical scores were compared with follow-up data by paired Wilcoxon tests for the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring system. Sex-specific differences were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. The MRI evaluation was performed with the Henderson score at final follow-up. Results: Clinical scores improved in all groups over the whole study period ( P &lt; .05). Compared with female patients, male patients achieved significantly better results in the Lysholm score at all time intervals and in the IKDC score at 6 and 12 months after surgery ( P &lt; .05). In a subgroup analysis, female patients with patellar defects had the worst results in both clinical scores. With the available number of patients, MRI evaluation at 48 months after surgery revealed no significant difference in defect fill between male and female patients ( P &gt; .05). The Pearson correlation coefficient between both clinical scores and the MRI parameters of defect fill and cartilage signal was significant ( P &lt; .05). Conclusion: Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a promising treatment option for full-thickness cartilage defects of male and female knee joints. Female patients with patellar defects have worse prognostic factors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-6041/9/4/045012,Osteochondral defect repair using a polyvinyl alcohol-polyacrylic acid (PVA-PAAc) hydrogel,"Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels can be candidates for articular cartilage repair due to their high water content. We synthesized a PVA-poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) hydrogel formulation and determined its ability to function as a treatment option for condylar osteochondral (OC) defects in a New Zealand white rabbit (NZWR) model for 12 weeks and 24 weeks. In addition to hydrogel OC implants, tensile bar-shaped hydrogels were also implanted subcutaneously to evaluate changes in mechanical properties as a function of in vivo duration. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the water content measured in the OC hydrogel implant that was harvested after 12 weeks and 24 weeks, and non-implanted controls. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the break stress, strain at break or modulus of the tensile bars either between groups. Histological analysis of the OC defect, synovial capsule and fibrous tissue around the tensile bars determined hydrogel biocompatibility. Twelve-week hydrogels were found to be in situ flush with the articular cartilage; meniscal tissue demonstrated an intact surface. Twenty-four week hydrogels protruded from the defect site due to lack of integration with subchondral tissue, causing fibrillation to the meniscal surface. Condylar micro-CT scans ruled out osteolysis and bone cysts of the subchondral bone, and no PVA-PAAc hydrogel contents were found in the synovial fluid. The PVA-PAAc hydrogel was determined to be fully biocompatible, maintained its properties over time, and performed well at the 12 week time point. Physical fixation of the PVA-PAAc hydrogel to the subchondral bone is required to ensure long-term performance of hydrogel plugs for OC defect repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-017-1679-x,Clinical and imaging outcome of osteochondral lesions of the talus treated using autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis technique with a biomimetic scaffold,"The purpose of our study was to assess the clinical and imaging outcome of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) technique consisting of microfractures followed by the filling of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) with a cell-free biphasic collagen-hydroxyapatite osteochondral scaffold (MaioRegen).Sixteen patients (eight males, age: 42.6 ± 18.4, range 14-74) with OLT repaired using AMIC technique, with implantation of MaioRegen, were clinically evaluated through the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) and a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score after a mean follow-up of 30 ± 16.9 months. The MRI examinations were performed 12 and 24 months after surgery. A paired t-test was applied to compare pre- and post-operative clinical findings (VAS and AOFAS) and Magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score changes in the follow-up. To assess the correlation between variation of AOFAS and MOCART scores, the Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated.No complications after surgery were encountered. From pre-operative to post-operative values, there was a significant (P < 0.001) reduction of mean VAS pain score (6.3 ± 0.9,range: 4-8 and 2.9 ± 1.8,range: 0-6, respectively) and increase of AOFAS score (60.2 ± 7.8,range: 50-74 and 77.4 ± 16.2,range: 50-100, respectively). Among 16 patients, six (37%) were not satisfied at the end of follow-up, six (37%) were moderately satisfied and four (25%) were highly satisfied. The treatment was considered failed in five out of 16 patients (31%). Among them, four (25%) required re-interventions with implantation of ankle prostheses, whereas one patient was treated with a further AMIC technique combined with autologous bone graft and platelet-rich plasma. The mean MOCART score was 41.9 ± 14.6 (25-70) 12 months after surgery and 51.9 ± 11.6 (30-70) after 24 months, with a statistically significant increase (P = 0.012). However, no correlation was seen between AOFAS and MOCART changes (r = 0.215, p = 0.609).The high rates of treatment failure encountered in our study using MaioRegen need to be confirmed by larger studies and should induce the scientific community questioning the reliability of this biomimetic scaffold for the treatment of OLTs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jgm.2972,BMP-2 gene activated muscle tissue fragments for osteochondral defect regeneration in the rabbit knee,"Previously published data indicate that BMP-2 gene activated muscle tissue grafts can repair large bone defects in rats. This innovative abbreviated ex vivo gene therapy is appealing because it does not require elaborative and time-consuming extraction and expansion of cells. Hence, in the present study, we evaluated the potential of this expedited tissue engineering approach for regenerating osteochondral defects in rabbits.Autologous muscle tissue grafts from female White New Zealand rabbits were directly transduced with an adenoviral BMP-2 vector or remained unmodified. Osteochondral defects in the medial condyle of rabbit knees were treated with either BMP-2 activated muscle tissue implants or unmodified muscle tissue or remained empty. After 13 weeks, repair of osteochondral defects was examined by biomechanical indentation testing and by histology/imunohistochemistry applying an extended O'Driscoll scoring system and histomorphometry.Biomechanical investigations revealed a trend towards slightly improved mechanical properties of the group receiving BMP-2 activated muscle tissue compared to unmodified muscle treatment and empty defect controls. However, a statistically significant difference was noted only between BMP-2 muscle and unmodified muscle treatment. Also, histological evaluation resulted in slightly higher histological scores and improved collagen I/II ratio without statistical significance in the BMP-2 treatment group. Histomorphometry indicated enhanced repair of subchondral bone after treatment with BMP-2 muscle, with a significantly larger bone area compared to untreated defects.Gene activated muscle tissue grafts showed potential for osteochondral defect repair. There is room for improvement via the use of appropriate growth factor combinations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-007-0175-z,Autologous chondrocyte implantation: Prospective MRI evaluation with clinical correlation,"Purpose. This study was done to assess the progression of cartilage repair after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to correlate the findings with the clinical outcome. Materials and methods. Forty-one patients (mean age 30 years) affected by chondral defects of the knee (27 patients) and ankle joint (14 patients) who underwent arthroscopic autologous osteochondral grafting were studied 6 months and 1 year postoperatively with MRI. Cartilage repair after chondrocyte implantation was studied by assessing the degree of defect filling, graft integration, graft signal intensity, integrity of the subchondral lamina and trabecular oedema underneath the graft. MR findings were correlated with clinical data. Results. Postoperative MRI evaluation at 6 months demonstrated complete filling of the osteochondral defect in 12/41 cases, complete integration in 18/41, mild hyperintensity in 28/41, intact subchondral lamina in 38/41 and trabecular oedema in 11/41. Postoperative MRI evaluation at I year demonstrated complete filling of the osteochondral defect in 9/41 patients, complete integration in 22/41, mild hyperintensity in 23/41, intact subchondral lamina in 36/41 and trabecular oedema in 8/41. Filling of the osteochondral defect and incomplete integration, nonintact subchondral lamina, high signal intensity and absence of oedema were found to correlate with worse clinical-functional outcomes. Conclusions. MRI shows direct prognostic signs of the clinical outcome of ACI.",0

EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Knowledge databases were screened for the use of cBMA in the repair of cartilage, bone, and tendon repair. We extracted data on tissue type, cBMA preparation, cBMA concentration, study methods, outcomes, and level of evidence and reported the results in tables and text.A total of 36 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in this review. Thirty-one of 36 (86%) studies reported the method of centrifugation and preparation of cBMA with 15 (42%) studies reporting either a cell concentration or an increase from baseline. Variation of cBMA application was seen amongst the studies evaluated. Twenty-one of 36 (58%) were level of evidence IV, 12/36 (33%) were level of evidence III, and 3/36 (8%) were level of evidence II. Studies evaluated full thickness chondral lesions (7 studies), osteochondral lesions (10 studies), osteoarthritis (5 studies), nonunion or fracture (9 studies), or tendon injuries (5 studies). Significant clinical improvement with the presence of hyaline-like values and lower incidence of fibrocartilage on T2 mapping was found in patients receiving cBMA in the treatment of cartilaginous lesions. Bone consolidation and time to bone union was improved in patients receiving cBMA. Enhanced healing rates, improved quality of the repair surface on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, and a decreased risk of re-rupture was demonstrated in patients receiving cBMA as an adjunctive treatment in tendon repair.The current literature demonstrates the potential benefits of utilizing cBMA for the repair of cartilaginous lesions, bony defects, and tendon injuries in the clinical setting. This study also demonstrates discrepancies between the literature with regards to various methods of centrifugation, variable cell count concentrations, and lack of standardized outcome measures. Future studies should attempt to examine the integral factors necessary for tissue regeneration and renewal including stem cells, growth factors and a biologic scaffold.",0
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2243,Improved cartilage regeneration by implantation of acellular biomaterials after bone marrow stimulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies,"Microfracture surgery may be applied to treat cartilage defects. During the procedure the subchondral bone is penetrated, allowing bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to migrate towards the defect site and form new cartilage tissue. Microfracture surgery generally results in the formation of mechanically inferior fibrocartilage. As a result, this technique offers only temporary clinical improvement. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may improve the outcome of microfracture surgery. Filling the subchondral defect with a biomaterial may provide a template for the formation of new hyaline cartilage tissue. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the current evidence for the efficacy of cartilage regeneration in preclinical models using acellular biomaterials implanted after marrow stimulating techniques (microfracturing and subchondral drilling) compared to the natural healing response of defects. The review aims to provide new insights into the most effective biomaterials, to provide an overview of currently existing knowledge, and to identify potential lacunae in current studies to direct future research. A comprehensive search was systematically performed in PubMed and EMBASE (via OvidSP) using search terms related to tissue engineering, cartilage and animals. Primary studies in which acellular biomaterials were implanted in osteochondral defects in the knee or ankle joint in healthy animals were included and study characteristics tabulated (283 studies out of 6,688 studies found). For studies comparing non-treated empty defects to defects containing implanted biomaterials and using semi-quantitative histology as outcome measure, the risk of bias (135 studies) was assessed and outcome data were collected for meta-analysis (151 studies). Random-effects meta-analyses were performed, using cartilage regeneration as outcome measure on an absolute 0-100% scale. Implantation of acellular biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 15.6% compared to non-treated empty defect controls. The addition of biologics to biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 7.6% compared to control biomaterials. No significant differences were found between biomaterials from natural or synthetic origin or between scaffolds, hydrogels and blends. No noticeable differences were found in outcome between animal models. The risk of bias assessment indicated poor reporting for the majority of studies, impeding an assessment of the actual risk of bias. In conclusion, implantation of biomaterials in osteochondral defects improves cartilage regeneration compared to natural healing, which is further improved by the incorporation of biologics.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603514560655,A Stereological Method for the Quantitative Evaluation of Cartilage Repair Tissue,"To implement stereological principles to develop an easy applicable algorithm for unbiased and quantitative evaluation of cartilage repair.Design-unbiased sampling was performed by systematically sectioning the defect perpendicular to the joint surface in parallel planes providing 7 to 10 hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections. Counting windows were systematically selected and converted into image files (40-50 per defect). The quantification was performed by two-step point counting: (1) calculation of defect volume and (2) quantitative analysis of tissue composition. Step 2 was performed by assigning each point to one of the following categories based on validated and easy distinguishable morphological characteristics: (1) hyaline cartilage (rounded cells in lacunae in hyaline matrix), (2) fibrocartilage (rounded cells in lacunae in fibrous matrix), (3) fibrous tissue (elongated cells in fibrous tissue), (4) bone, (5) scaffold material, and (6) others. The ability to discriminate between the tissue types was determined using conventional or polarized light microscopy, and the interobserver variability was evaluated.We describe the application of the stereological method. In the example, we assessed the defect repair tissue volume to be 4.4 mm(3) (CE = 0.01). The tissue fractions were subsequently evaluated. Polarized light illumination of the slides improved discrimination between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage and increased the interobserver agreement compared with conventional transmitted light.We have applied a design-unbiased method for quantitative evaluation of cartilage repair, and we propose this algorithm as a natural supplement to existing descriptive semiquantitative scoring systems. We also propose that polarized light is effective for discrimination between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00132-008-1290-9,Aktuelle Behandlung des Knorpelschadens im Patellofemoralgelenk,"Joint cartilage damage in adults has practically no tendency to self healing. Symptomatic grade III/IV damage requires surgical treatment. There are special challenges involved in cartilage damage in the patellofemoral joint as the complicated biomechanics of the joint is often combined with dysplasia. All tissue regeneration measures are based on the recruitment of cells. The synovial cells available in the joint can be differentiated to fibrous cartilage under certain mechanical conditions; however, they cannot sufficiently fill in defects. Also the use of bone marrow cells for cartilage reconstruction only creates mechanically inferior fibrous cartilage (Pridie drillings, microfracture, AMIC). Presently only cultivated, autologous chondrocytes from the lab are available for a biomechanically high-quality reconstruction of the cartilage layer.The application of mesenchymal stem cells is a subject of extensive international research. However, the first experimental studies, after initial formation of cartilage, disappointingly show significant ossification. Essential conditions for a successful treatment of patellofemoral cartilage damage are the diagnosis of accompanying pathological conditions, selection of the right cartilage-regenerating procedure, sufficient removal of the basic pathological defect, and implementation of standardized rehabilitation.",0

Due to the lack of donor-site morbidity and the single-stage procedure cell-free scaffolds are an interesting alternative to cell-based procedures. But as currently mid- and long-term data are lacking, the aim of the present study was to present mid-term clinical, radiological and histological results of a cell-free collagen type I scaffolds for cartilage repair.Materials and methodsTwenty-eight patients were followed prospectively. Clinical evaluation using patient-reported outcome measures (KOOS, IKDC; VAS for pain, Tegner score for activity) as well as radiologic evaluation of the repair tissue (MOCART) was performed at 1year, 2years and 5years. Histologic evaluation of the repair tissue was done in case of revision surgery using the ICRS II score for human cartilage repair.ResultsIn these large cartilage defects with a mean defect size of 3.71.9cm(2), clinical failure necessitating revision surgery was seen in 5 of 28 patients (18%). While the remaining patients showed good-to-excellent clinical results (KOOS, IKDC, VAS, Tegner), the radiologic appearance of the repair tissue showed a reduction of the MOCART score between the 2- and 5-year follow-up. Histologic evaluation of the repair tissue showed a cartilage-like appearance with no signs of inflammation or cell death but an overall medium tissue quality according to the ICRS II Score.Conclusion p id=Par4 The use of this cell-free collagen type I scaffold for large defects showed increased wear of the repair tissue and clinical failure in 18% of cases at 5-year follow-up.",0

We enrolled 15 knees (13 patients) in this study. The mean age at surgery was 26.4 ± 9.1 years, and the mean postoperative follow-up was 28.8 ± 10.2 months. A musculoskeletal radiologist evaluated each knee with postoperative MRI for the International Cartilage Repair Society cartilage repair assessment score, graft hypertrophy, bony changes around the graft, and percent fill of the defect. All patients also completed the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation, and Kujala clinical outcome survey (scale, 0 to 100), as well as the Tegner activity scale and visual analog pain scale (scale, 0 to 10).The mean International Cartilage Repair Society cartilage repair assessment score on MRI was 8.0 ± 2.8, a nearly normal assessment. Of 15 knees, 11 (73%) were found to have normal or nearly normal cartilage repair. Three patients had mild graft hypertrophy whereas 2 had gross graft hypertrophy, 2 of whom required arthroscopic debridement because of symptoms. The mean fill of the defect at follow-up was 89% ± 19.6%, with 12 of 15 knees (80%) showing at least 90% defect coverage. The mean clinical outcome score at follow-up was 73.3 ± 17.6 for the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation, and the mean scores for each subdomain of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were as follows: 84.2 ± 14.2 for pain, 85.0 ± 12.3 for symptoms and stiffness, 88.9 ± 12.9 for activities of daily living, 62.0 ± 25.1 for sports and recreation, and 60.8 ± 28.6 for quality of life. The median score for the Kujala survey was 79 (range, 55 to 99). The median score on the Tegner activity scale was 5 (range, 3 to 9), and the mean score on the visual analog scale was 1.9 ± 1.4, indicating minimal pain.Preliminary results suggest that cartilage restoration using particulated juvenile articular cartilage allograft offers a viable option for patients with focal grade 4 articular cartilage defects of the patella.",0

Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes were assessed 12 and 24 months postoperatively for efficacy and adverse events. Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) assessment was used to analyze cartilage tissue repair. MRI outcomes for 50% defect filling and repaired tissue/reference cartilage (RT/RC) ratio were quantified using T2 mapping. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and 20% improvement, minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and patient acceptable symptom state for Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the International Knee Documentation Committee score. <h3>Results</h3> MOCART scores in the investigation group showed improved defect repair and filling (<i>P</i> = .0201), integration with the border zone (<i>P</i> = .0062), and effusion (<i>P</i> = .0079). MRI outcomes showed that the odds ratio (OR) for ≥50% defect filling at 12 months was statistically higher in the investigation group (OR 3.984, <i>P</i> = .0377). Moreover, the likelihood of the RT/RC OR becoming ≥1 was significantly higher (OR 11.37, <i>P</i> = .0126) in the investigation group. At 24 months postoperatively, the OR for the VAS 20% improvement rate was significantly higher in the investigational group (OR 2.808, <i>P</i> = .047). Twenty-three patients (52.3%) in the control group and 35 (77.8%) in the investigation group demonstrated more than the MCID of KOOS pain from baseline to 1 year postoperatively, with a significant difference between groups (<i>P</i> = .0116). <h3>Conclusion</h3> In this multicenter randomized trial, the addition of C-ACT resulted in better filling of cartilage defect of the knee joint. <h3>Level of Evidence</h3> Level Ⅰ, Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial",1

The technique was used for treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects in the knee. Five patients were prospectively evaluated during 2 years with use of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Tegner activity scale and the visual analog scale (VAS). MRI data were analyzed based on the original and modified MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) scoring system at 6, 12 and 24 months of follow-up. A gradual clinical improvement was observed during the follow-up. Adverse reactions to the matrix were not observed. The scaffold was firmly fixed with the use of bioresorbable pins. Both MOCART scoring systems revealed no significant deterioration or improvement in the repair tissue during the follow-up period. However, the majority of the patients exhibited subchondral lamina and bone changes. The formation of an intralesional osteophyte was observed in one case. The key finding in this study was that this procedure is safe for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee. The patients showed a gradual clinical improvement postoperatively. Sixty percent (3/5) of the defects were adequately (complete or hypertrophic) filled with repair tissue at 2 years of follow-up. IV.",0

Autologous cell-based cartilage repair, for example, autologous chondrocyte implantation, is limited by the need for ex vivo chondrocyte expansion and donor site morbidity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their relative ease of isolation, higher replication activity, and chondrogenic potential, represent an alternative reparative cell type. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous, growth factor-rich biologic preparation that has recently received increasing attention and use as a therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases, and there is evidence suggesting that PRP acts by promoting stem cell proliferation and tissue healing. In this study, we have examined the effect of PRP treatment on chondrogenic differentiation of adult human MSCs derived from infrapatellar fat pad-adipose stem cells (IFP-ASCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs). Both cell types were placed in high-density pellet culture and hydrogel-encapsulated culture under chondrogenic conditions. Our results showed that PRP did not improve IFP-ASC or BM-MSC chondrogenesis. In general, chondrogenesis was inhibited with increasing PRP concentrations and duration of exposure, on the basis of histological, biochemical, and gene expression analyses. Taken together, these findings suggest that although PRP is reported to be beneficial in terms of pain relief and joint function improvement, its mechanism of action is unlikely to directly involve enhancement of MSC-mediated hyaline cartilage formation.",0

Design Thirty subjects with an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade 3 to 4 chondral defect (2-10 cm 2 in area; ≤4 cm 3 in volume) were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 (CCP-ACI:MFx). Twenty patients were allocated in the CCP-ACI group and 10 patients in the MFx group. CCP-ACI was performed by harvesting costal cartilage at least 4 weeks before surgery. Implantation was performed without any marrow stimulation. Efficacy and safety were assessed at weeks 8, 24, and 48 after surgery according to the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score and clinical outcomes. Results MOCART scores improved from baseline to 24 and 48 weeks postoperatively in both treatment groups. The improvement in MOCART scores in the CCP-ACI group was significantly greater than that in the MFx group at 24 and 48 weeks (39.1 vs 21.8 and 43.0 vs 24.8, respectively). The proportions of complete defect repair and complete integration were significantly higher in the CCP-ACI group than the MFx group at 48 weeks. Improvement in Lysholm score and KOOS subscores, including Function (Sports and Recreational Activity) and knee-related quality of life was significantly greater in the CCP-ACI group than the MFx group at 48 weeks (35.4 vs 31.5, 35.7 vs 28.5, and 27.9 vs 11.6, respectively). Conclusion Treatment of cartilage defects with CCP-ACI yielded satisfactory cartilage tissue repair outcomes, with good structural integration with native cartilage tissue shown by magnetic resonance imaging at 24 and 48 weeks after surgery.

To observe the efficacy of Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs in repairing articular cartilage defects in SD rats.ADSCs were isolated and characterized by performing induced differentiation and flow cytometry assays. Alginate-gelatine microspheres with different gelatine concentrations were manufactured by electrospraying, and the appropriate alginate-gelatine concentration and ratio were determined by evaluating microsphere formation. Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs were compared with Alg-ADSCs MSs through the induction of chondrogenic differentiation and culture. Their feasibility for cartilage tissue engineering was analysed by performing Live/Dead staining, cell proliferation analysis, toluidine blue staining and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content analysis. Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs were implanted in the cartilage defects of SD rats, and the cartilage repair effect was evaluated at different time points. The evaluation included gross observations and histological evaluations, fluorescence imaging tracking, immunohistochemical staining, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and a CatWalk evaluation.The isolated ADSCs showed multidirectional differentiation and were used for cartilage tissue engineering. Using 1.5 w:v% alginate and 0.5 w:v% gelatine (Type B), we successfully prepared nearly spherical microspheres. Compared with alginate microspheres, alginate gel increased the viability of ADSCs and promoted the proliferation and chondrogenesis of ADSCs. In our experiments on knee cartilage defects in SD rats in vivo, the Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs showed superior cartilage repair in cell resides, histology evaluation, micro-CT imaging and gait analysis.Microspheres composed of 1.5 w:v% alginate-0.5 w:v% gelatine increase the viability of ADSCs and supported their proliferation and deposition of cartilage matrix components. ADSCs embedded in 1.5 w:v% alginate-0.5 w:v% gelatine microspheres show superior repair efficacy and prospective applications in cartilage tissue repair.In this study, injectable adipose-derived stem cells-embedded alginate-gelatin microspheres (Alg-Gel-ADSCs MSs) were prepared by the electrospray . Compared with the traditional alginate microspheres, its support ability for ADSCs is better and shows a better repair effect. This study provides a promising strategy for cartilage tissue regeneration.",0

The forces were recorded for an intact femoral condyle, as well as a standardized cartilage defect of 25 × 20 mm, after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (m-ACI) (BioSeed C; Biotissue Technologies, Freiburg, Germany), fixed by use of a conventional suture technique and pin fixation with a biodegradable pin perpendicular and 30° tilted to the matrix surface.In knees with cartilage defects, the peak compression forces (mean, 824 kPa) were significantly increased compared with the intact knee joint (564 kPa). After m-ACI implantation with a chondral suture (581.3 kPa) and perpendicular pin fixation, the joint compression forces of the cartilage defect were significantly decreased (630.7 kPa). There were no significant differences compared with the intact knee. After 30° tilted pin insertion, mean joint compression forces were significantly increased (1,740 kPa).This study shows that after chondral suture and perpendicular pin fixation, there are no increased compression forces in the knee joint in comparison to an intact knee. Thirty degree tilted pin insertion contributes to increased joint compression forces.A tilted insertion during pin fixation in m-ACI should be avoided because it may lead to increased joint compression forces, especially after cartilage defect lesions on the tibial side.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/0470867973.ch13,Cartilage Repair with Chondrocytes: Clinical and Cellular Aspects,"Articular cartilage has a limited potential to repair. Unsatisfactory results with current treatment methods (e.g. osteochondral autografts, drilling or microfracturing) has triggered the development of new cartilage restoration techniques including autologous cell transplantation (mesenchymal stem cells or chondrocytes) with or without supporting scaffolds. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) was first used in humans in 1987 and the first pilot was published in 1994. Two years after transplantation, 14 of the 16 patients with femoral condyle transplants had a restored joint function and 11 of 15 femoral transplants demonstrated a hyaline repair tissue. Results from patellar transplants were less encouraging. To date, we have treated over 1000 and other groups over 6000 patients. The technique gives stable long-term results with a high percentage of good to excellent results (84-90%) in patients with different types of single femoral condyle lesions, whereas in patients with other types of lesions in the knee it is less successful (average 74%). A better understanding of the repair mechanism induced by the cultured chondrocytes and the regulatory mechanisms controlling chondrogenic differentiation combined with identification and culture of stem cells with chondrogenic potential will be the key to new cartilage treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1847-8,Cell-free repair of small cartilage defects in the Goettinger minipig: which defect size is possible?,"Cartilage repair of full-thickness chondral defects in the knees of Goettinger minipigs was assessed by treatment with cell-free collagen type-I gel plugs of three different sizes. In 6 adult Goettinger minipigs, three full-thickness chondral defects were created in the trochlear groove of one knee of the hind leg. These defects were treated with a cell-free collagen type-I gel plug of 8, 10, or 12 mm diameter. All animals were allowed unlimited weight bearing. After 1 year, the animals were killed. Immediately after recovery, a non-destructive biomechanical testing was performed. The repair tissue quality was evaluated immunohistologically, collagen type-II protein was quantified, and a semiquantitative score (O'Driscoll score) was calculated. After 1 year, a high number of cells migrated into the initially cell-free collagen gel plugs and a hyaline-like repair tissue had been created. The O'Driscoll scores were: 8 mm, 21.2 (SD, 2.8); 10 mm, 21.5 (SD, 1.6); and 12 mm, 22.3 (SD, 1.0). The determination of the e-modulus, creep and relaxation revealed that mechanical properties of the two smaller defects were closer to unaffected hyaline cartilage. As cell-free collagen type-I gel plugs of all three different sizes created hyaline-like repair tissue, this system seems suitable for the treatment of even larger defects.",0

By having basic knowledge of these surgical procedures, radiologists can more accurately interpret imaging studies obtained after surgery. In this article, we briefly review the different types of cartilage repair procedures, their appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathologic MRI findings associated with postoperative complications. We also briefly discuss advanced MRI techniques (T2 mapping, delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage, sodium MRI) that have been recently used to assess the biochemical composition of repair tissue matrix. MRI can accurately assess the status and health of cartilage repair tissue. By providing this information to orthopedic surgeons, radiologists can play a valuable role in the management of patients who undergo cartilage repair surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2005.08.006,Magnetic resonance imaging characterization of osteochondral defect repair in a goat model at 8T,"This study was performed to non-invasively visualize and characterize osteochondral (OC) repair in ex vivo goat stifles using an 8 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and to compare the MR morphology with images obtained from 1.5 T, gross morphology and histology.Mature, neutered male goats were assigned to an 8-week (n = 4) or 16-week (n = 4) study period. Two cylindrical OC defects (7 mm diameter, full cartilage thickness and 1mm into subchondral bone) were surgically created in the right stifle: one in the medial femoral condyle (MFC) and the other in the trochlear groove (TG). The implant matrices (non-woven or foam) were secured in the defect using a bottom anchored fixation device (FD). The contralateral left stifles served as time zero controls. At the day of necropsy, implants were placed at both defect sites (MFC and TG) on the normal left stifles. Following necropsy, the ex vivo goat stifles (intact and encapsulated) were disarticulated. Within 24 h postnecropsy, MR scans of the stifles along the mid-sagittal plane of the OC defect were acquired at 8 T and 1.5 T. MR relaxation times, T1 and T2, were measured at the region of repair tissue (RT) and adjacent native cartilage. Immediately after MR imaging, the stifles were dissected, grossly examined, and a sagittal OC block corresponding to the MR region of interest was prepared for formalin fixation.The high-resolution MR images enabled visualization of cartilage and bone integrity surrounding the implant as well as delineating the margins of RT/implant matrix and the FD. On spin echo sequence, the RT variably appeared as high, intermediate or low MR signal intensity; whereas, the FD always appeared as low signal intensity. In general, the MR signal intensity of 8-week RT was slightly higher compared to 16-week RT; however, there was no difference in RT morphology of stifles implanted with the non-woven matrix or foam matrix. Subchondral sclerosis appeared as low signal intensity. The 8 T MR images showed better delineation of the stifle tissues compared to the images acquired at 1.5 T. The T2 relaxation time of the RT appears to indicate (inconclusive due to small number of samples) a slight variation in the RT type between 8 weeks and 16 weeks. At both study times, the defects grossly appeared whitish to reddish but did not have the characteristic hyaline appearance typical of articular cartilage (AC). The gross appearance of the MFC and TG RT differed, which was predominantly mottled and recessed with fissuring of adjacent native AC in the MFC. Histologically, the RT of both 8-week and 16-week postsurgical defects predominantly comprised fibrovascular connective tissue with only few samples showing the presence of fibrocartilaginous and/or hypertrophic chondrocytes within the defect RT at 8 weeks. Also, compared to 8-week, the 16-week RT appeared to be more fibrotic.Using 8 T scanner, high-resolution MR images of ex vivo encapsulated goat stifles confirmed the capability of high-field MR imaging to distinguish the defect RT from the FD and adjacent joint tissues. The extent of OC repair and adjacent bone lesions (at 8 weeks and 16 weeks) observed in the MR images compared well with those observed on the corresponding histological sections.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2716-4,Cartilage extra-cellular matrix biomembrane for the enhancement of microfractured defects,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether the biomembrane made of cartilage extracellular matrix, designed to provide cartilage-like favourable environments as well as to prevent against washout of blood clot after microfracture, would enhance cartilage repair compared with the conventional microfracture technique. A prospective trial was designed to compare the biomembrane cover after microfracture with conventional microfracture among patients with grade III-IV symptomatic cartilage defect in the knee joint. Patients aged 18-60 years were assigned to either the microfracture/biomembrane (n = 45) or microfracture groups (n = 19). Among them, 24 knees in the microfracture/biomembrane and 12 knees in the microfracture were followed up for 2 years. Cartilage repair was assessed with magnetic resonance imagings taken 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively, and the clinical outcomes were also recorded. Compared with conventional microfracture, microfracture/biomembrane resulted in greater degree of cartilage repair (p = 0.043). In the intra-group analysis, while microfracture showed moderate to good degree of cartilage repair in nearly 50 % of the patients (47 % at 6 months to 50 % at 2 years; n.s.), microfracture/biomembrane maintained an equivalent degree of repair up to 2 years (88 % at 6 months to 75 % at 2 years; n.s.). The clinical outcome at 2 years also showed improved knee score and satisfaction and decreased pain in each group, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Compared with conventional microfracture, biomembrane cover after microfracture yielded superior outcome in terms of the degree of cartilage repair during 2 years of follow-up. This implies that initial protection of blood clot and immature repair tissue at the microfractured defect is important for the promotion of enhanced cartilage repair, which may be obtained by the application of a biomembrane.

The Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC) procedure is a single-step technique with a collagen I/III scaffold for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage lesions. The aim of the study was to analyze the outcome of the AMIC procedure in overweight patients with knee cartilage defects. Overweight patients treated with AMIC surgery were followed up by clinical and MRI examination. 9 patients with a cartilage defect of the knee with a mean lesion size of <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mml:mn fontstyle=""italic"">2</mml:mn><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext><mml:mn fontstyle=""italic"">1</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=""italic"">1</mml:mn><mml:mtext>.</mml:mtext><mml:mn fontstyle=""italic"">2</mml:mn></mml:math> cm 2 and an average body mass index (BMI) of 29.3 were available for the follow-up. The Lysholm Score was significantly improved by the AMIC procedure (38 to 67, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M2""><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn fontstyle=""italic"">0.008</mml:mn></mml:math>).

In the postoperative MOCART Scale, the scaffold reached defect covering of 80%. However, 2 patients had to be revised due to persisting knee pain. The AMIC procedure enhances pain reduction and gain of knee function for cartilage defects of overweight patients. However, in cases of an increased BMI, the patient had to be informed that success rate is reduced despite good defect covering.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-13-11,Repair of a chondral defect using a cell free scaffold in a young patient - a case report of successful scaffold transformation and colonisation,"Chondral defects of the articular surface are a common condition that can lead to osteoarthritis if not treated. Therapy of this condition is a topic of constant debate and a variety of chondral repair strategies are currently used. One strategy involves implantation of a cell-free matrix of type I collagen (COL1), to provide a scaffold for chondrocyte migration and proliferation and extracellular matrix production. Although several studies have suggested that chondrocytes can move, to the best of our knowledge there is still no proof of chondrocyte occurrence in a former cell-free scaffold for articular cartilage repair in humans.An 18-year-old male patient underwent arthroscopic surgery of the knee for patellar instability and a chondral defect of the femoral condyle. Clinical outcome scores were recorded pre-operatively, after 6 weeks and after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. MRI was recorded after 6 weeks and after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. At 42 months after implantation of a cell-free type I collagen matrix and reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament, the patient was again treated arthroscopically for a tear of the medial meniscus of the same knee. A biopsy of the previous chondral defect was taken during arthroscopy for histological examination.In addition to good clinical and radiological results reported for cell-free scaffolds for cartilage repair in several other studies, transformation of the scaffold could be observed during re-arthroscopy for the meniscal tear. Histological examination of the specimen revealed articular cartilage with vital chondrocytes and a strong staining reaction for type II collagen (COL II), but no reaction for type I collagen staining. This might indicate a complete transformation of the scaffold and supports the theory that cell free scaffolds could support cell migration. Although the cell source remains unclear, migrating chondrocytes from the periphery remain a possibility.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/ar1709,,"Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) has been shown, in long-term follow-up studies, to be a promising treatment for the repair of isolated cartilage lesions. The method is based on an implantation of in vitro expanded chondrocytes originating from a small cartilage biopsy harvested from a non-weight-bearing area within the joint. In patients with osteoarthritis (OA), there is a need for the resurfacing of large areas, which could potentially be made by using a scaffold in combination with culture-expanded cells. As a first step towards a cell-based therapy for OA, we therefore investigated the expansion and redifferentiation potential in vitro of chondrocytes isolated from patients undergoing total knee replacement. The results demonstrate that OA chondrocytes have a good proliferation potential and are able to redifferentiate in a three-dimensional pellet model. During the redifferentiation, the OA cells expressed increasing amounts of DNA and proteoglycans, and at day 14 the cells from all donors contained type II collagen-rich matrix. The accumulation of proteoglycans was in comparable amounts to those from ACT donors, whereas total collagen was significantly lower in all of the redifferentiated OA chondrocytes. When the OA chondrocytes were loaded into a scaffold based on hyaluronic acid, they bound to the scaffold and produced cartilage-specific matrix proteins. Thus, autologous chondrocytes are a potential source for the biological treatment of OA patients but the limited collagen synthesis of the OA chondrocytes needs to be further explained.",0
https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.284075111,MR Imaging of Cartilage Repair in the Knee and Ankle,"Because of the relative avascularity of articular cartilage, lesions that are caused by trauma or degeneration of the cartilage do not heal spontaneously and must be repaired surgically. The interventional procedures that have been developed for the repair of such lesions include abrasion, microfracture, autologous osteochondral transplantation, allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. An accurate imaging assessment of the repair tissue is necessary in order to objectively evaluate the postoperative outcome. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and arthroscopy provide complementary information and are especially useful for follow-up evaluation of cartilage repair in the knee and ankle. Standard MR imaging techniques may be used postoperatively to evaluate the success of implantation and the state of cartilage healing. Newer matrix assessment techniques, which include delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging and mapping of T1rho and T2 values, may provide useful supplemental information about the histologic and biochemical contents of reparative tissue. The normal postoperative appearance of the joints after cartilage repair varies according to the surgical technique used and the stage of healing. To identify potential complications, it is important to be familiar with the various repair procedures and the characteristic MR imaging features of the repair tissue at various postoperative intervals.",0

Techniques 1 (pin) and 2 (transosseous anchoring) can be used arthroscopically.Maximum load and yield load were significantly higher in the group 1 (pin fixation) and group 2 (transosseous anchoring) compared to group 3 (conventional suture). Stiffness was significantly higher in group 1 than in groups 2 or 3.Our biomechanical data show that two fixation techniques (pin fixation and transosseous anchoring) have a higher ultimate load, yield load, and stiffness than the conventional suture technique at time point zero. However, these data can be interpreted only with the Bioceed-C matrix (BioTissue Technologies GmbH, Freiburg, Germany).Our biomechanical data show outstanding fixation strength with arthroscopic techniques that use Bioceed-C matrix scaffolds during autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Thus, arthroscopic fixation done with this biomaterial should benefit patients, which, in turn, should lead to further research on these arthroscopic techniques and this biomaterial.",0

This study aimed at investigating the potential of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids embedded in biomaterials to study the effect of biomaterial composition on cell differentiation. Pre-cultured (3 days, chondrogenic differentiation media) spheroids (250 cells/spheroid) were embedded in tyramine-modified hyaluronic acid (THA) and collagen type I (Col) composite hydrogels (four combinations of THA (12.5 vs 16.7 mg/ml) and Col (2.5 vs 1.7 mg/ml) content) at a cell density of 5 × 106 cells/ml (2 × 104 spheroids/ml). Macropellets derived from single hMSCs (2.5 × 105 cells, ScMP) or hMSC spheroids (2.5 × 105 cells, 103 spheroids, SpMP) served as control. hMSC differentiation was analyzed using glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, gene expression analysis and (immuno-)histology. Embedding of hMSC spheroids in THA-Col induced chondrogenic differentiation marked by upregulation of aggrecan (ACAN) and COL2A1, and the production of GAGs . Lower THA led to more pronounced chondrogenic phenotype compared to higher THA content. Col content had no significant influence on hMSC chondrogenesis. Pellet cultures showed an upregulation in chondrogenic-associated genes and production of GAGs with less upregulation of hypertrophic-associated genes in SpMP culture compared to ScMP group. This study presents hMSC pre-culture in spheroids as promising approach to study chondrogenic differentiation after biomaterial encapsulation at low total cell count (5 × 106/ml) without compromising chondrogenic matrix production. This approach can be applied to assemble microtissues in biomaterials to generate large cartilage construct. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In vitro studies investigating the chondrogenic potential of biomaterials are limited due to the low cell-cell contact of encapsulated single cells. Here, we introduce the use of pre-cultured hMSC spheroids to study chondrogenesis upon encapsulation in a biomaterial. The use of spheroids takes advantage of the high cell-cell contact within each spheroid being critical in the early chondrogenesis of hMSCs. At a low seeding density of 5·106 cells/ml (2 × 104 spheroids/ml) we demonstrated hMSC chondrogenesis and cartilaginous matrix deposition. Our results indicate that the pre-culture might have a beneficial effect on hypertrophic gene expression without compromising chondrogenic differentiation. This approach has shown potential to assemble microtissues (here spheroids) in biomaterials to generate large cartilage constructs and to study the effect of biomaterial composition on cell alignment and migration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603517746723,Biological Response Following Inlay Arthroplasty of the Knee: Cartilage Flow Over the Implant,"Objective Inlay arthroplasty (IA) has seen growing interest as a new primary arthroplasty intervention for patients that need to transition from biology to joint replacement. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological response to this procedure. Design Patients presenting with symptomatic mono- or bicompartmental arthrosis and varus malalignment underwent IA and concurrent medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). A subset of patients required hardware removal and consented to second-look arthroscopy without biopsy allowing for assessment of IA components and compartment-specific findings related to implant fixation, cartilage flow, propagation of lesions, and opposing tibial surfaces. Results In a series of 41 knees (35 patients) treated with combined IA and HTO (mean varus &gt;7°), 26 knees (23 patients, 18 male, 5 female) with a mean age of 52 years (range = 43-67) required HTO plate removal. Concurrent second look arthroscopy was performed at a mean of 14 months (range = 12-19) following the index procedure. On probing, all arthroplasty components showed solid fixation without gap formation. On the medial femoral condyle, 15 mm implants ( n = 14) showed a peripheral cartilage flow of 12% (range = 5% to 25%), 20 mm implants ( n = 12) of 9% (range 5% to 15%), and trochlear implants ( n = 12) of 20% (range 10% to 40%). No progressive deterioration of the index defects or progression of tibial and retropatellar grades were seen. Conclusion Joint surface reconstruction using IA showed stable fixation with peripheral cartilage coverage ranging from 9% to 20% and no further chondral damage on opposing surfaces. Future clinical effectiveness studies are required to support the positive biological integration.",0

Studies reported on patient clinical scores such as Hospital for Special Surgery score, Knee Society Score (knee and function score), and Lysholm score. Reoperation and failure rates were recorded for each study. Modified Coleman Methodology Scores assessed study methodological quality.Five studies with a total of 291 patients (55% male, 45% female) and average age of 34.8 years (range, 15 to 69 years) were included. Of all lesions, 67% were on the femoral condyles, 29% on the tibial plateau, and 4% were patellofemoral. All scores (Knee Society Function Score, Knee Society Knee Score, and Lysholm score) have significant mean improvement from preoperative to final follow-up. The mean postoperative Hospital for Special Surgery score was 84.1. The mean failure rate was 25% at 12.3 years with a reoperation rate of 36%. A total of 72% of the failures were conversion to total (68%) or unicompartmental (4%) knee arthroplasty and 28% involved graft removal, graft fixation, and graft revision. Patellofemoral lesions (83%) had a significantly higher reoperation rate than lesions involving the tibial plateau or the femoral condyles (34%, P = .01).Overall, OCA demonstrated significant improvements in clinical outcome scores and good durability with successful outcomes in 75% of the patients at 12.3 years after surgery. Patellofemoral lesions are associated with decreased clinical improvement and more frequent reoperations. The orthopaedic literature is limited by heterogeneity in surgical technique, lesion and patient characteristics, and reporting of nonstandardized outcome measures.Level IV, systematic review of Level II and IV studies.",0

,Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation addressing focal chondral defect in adolescent knee.,"Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) is the third generation tissue-engineering technique for the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects. The aim of this study was to describe this new technique and the postoperative findings in adolescent knee with focal chondral defect.The MACI consists of diagnostic arthroscopy and cartilage harvest, chondrocyte culture and seeding in tissue-engineering collagenous membrane, and implantation of the scaffold. Clinical outcome at minimum 1-year follow-up was assessed in seven patients (mean age (16.6 ± 1.5) years; 14 - 19 years) with full-thickness cartilage defects, with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Besides, MR imaging was performed with T1 and T2-weighted imaging and three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled (3D-SPGR) MR imaging.Clinical evaluation showed significant improvement and MRI analysis showed that the structure was homogeneous and the implant surface was regular and intact in six patients, but irregular in one. Of all the seven patients, the cartilage defect site was nearly totally covered by the implanted scaffold.These results indicated that MACI technique is an option for cartilage defect in adolescent knee joint, especially large defect of over 2 cm(2). Long-term assessment is necessary to determine the true value of this technique.",0

Hypothesis Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound accelerates healing of bone-to-tendon junction repair by promoting osteogenesis and tissue remodeling at the healing junction. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Standard partial patellectomy was conducted in forty-eight 18-week-old rabbits divided into an ultrasound treatment and control group. Daily ultrasound was delivered 3 days after surgery onto the patellar tendon–patella healing junction and continuously up to weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16 postoperatively, when the patella–patellar tendon complexes were harvested for radiographic, histologic, and biomechanical evaluations. Results Radiographic measurements showed significantly more newly formed bone at the patellar tendon–patella healing junction in the ultrasound group compared with the controls at week 8 (4.91 ± 2.74 mm 2 vs 2.50 ± 1.83 mm 2 , P &lt; .05) and week 16 (7.22 ± 2.34 mm 2 vs 4.61 ± 2.22 mm 2 , P &lt; .05) after partial patellectomy. Histologically, the ultrasound group at weeks 8 and 16 showed improved tissue integration, characterized by trabecular bone expansion from the remaining patella and regeneration of fibrocartilage layer at the patellar tendon–patella healing junction. Fluorescence microscopy revealed earlier bone formation in the ultrasound group when compared with the controls at week 8 (1.78 ± 0.32 vs 1.23 ± 0.43, P &lt; .01) and week 16 (2.10 ± 0.67 vs 1.29 ± 0.35, P &lt; .01). Mechanical testing showed significantly higher failure load and ultimate strength in the ultrasound group (300.2 ± 61.7 N and 7.10 ± 1.29 MPa, respectively) as compared with controls (222.3 ± 65.1 N and 5.26 ± 1.36 MPa, respectively) at week 16 (P &lt; .05 for both). Conclusion Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound was able to accelerate bone-to-tendon junction repair. Clinical Relevance These results may help establish treatment efficacy for accelerating bone-to-tendon junction repair and facilitating earlier rehabilitation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603517715736,"Osteochondritis Dissecans: Etiology, Pathology, and Imaging with a Special Focus on the Knee Joint","This article is a review of the current understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, and how to diagnose and treat knee osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) followed by an analysis of and outcomes of the treatments available. OCD is seen in children and adolescents with open growth plates (juvenile OCD) and adults with closed growth plates (adult OCD). The etiology of OCD lesions remains unclear and is characterized by an aseptic necrosis in the subchondral bone area. Mechanical factors seem to play an important role. Clinical symptoms are unspecific. Thus, imaging techniques are most important. Regarding treatment, a tremendous number of publications exist. Spontaneous healing is expected unless there is an unstable fragment, and treatment involves rest and different degrees of immobilization until healing. Patients with open physes and low-grade lesions have good results with conservative therapy. When surgery is necessary, the procedure depends on the stage and on the state of the cartilage. With intact cartilage, retrograde procedures are favorable. When the cartilage is damaged, several techniques can be used. While techniques such as drilling and microfracturing produce reparative cartilage, other techniques reconstruct the defect with additional osteochondral grafts or cell-based procedures such as chondrocyte transplantation. There is a tendency toward better results when using procedures that reconstruct the bone and the cartilage and there is also a trend toward better long-term results when comorbidities are treated. Severe grades of osteoarthrosis are rare.",0

MACI was followed by a structured rehabilitation program in all patients. Clinical scores were administered preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months as well as 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery. These included the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm knee scale (LKS), Tegner activity scale (TAS), visual analog scale for pain, Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), active knee motion, and 6-minute walk test. Isokinetic dynamometry was used to assess peak knee extension and flexion strength and limb symmetry indices (LSIs) between the operated and nonoperated limbs. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 3 months and at 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively to evaluate graft repair as well as calculate the MRI composite score.There was a significant improvement ( P < .05) in all KOOS subscale scores, LKS and TAS scores, the SF-36 physical component score, pain frequency and severity, active knee flexion and extension, and 6-minute walk distance. Isokinetic knee extension strength significantly improved, and all knee extension and flexion LSIs were above 90% (apart from peak knee extension strength at 1 year). At 5 years, 93% of patients were satisfied with MACI to relieve their pain, 90% were satisfied with improving their ability to undertake daily activities, and 80% were satisfied with the improvement in participating in sport. Graft infill ( P = .033) and the MRI composite score ( P = .028) significantly improved over time, with 90% of patients demonstrating good to excellent tissue infill at 5 years. There were 2 graft failures at 5 years after surgery.The arthroscopically performed MACI technique demonstrated good clinical and radiological outcomes up to 5 years, with high levels of patient satisfaction.",0
https://doi.org/10.4067/s0716-97602013000400015,Clinical and experimental approaches to knee cartilage lesion repair and mesenchymal stem cell chondrocyte differentiation,"Cartilage has poor regeneration capacity due to the scarcity of endogenous stem cells, its low metabolic activity and the avascular environment. Repair strategies vary widely, including microfracture, autologous or allogenic tissue implantation, and in vitro engineered tissues of autologous origin. However, unlike the advances that have been made over more than two decades with more complex organs, including vascular, cardiac or bone tissues, similar advances in tissue engineering for cartilage repair are lacking. Although the inherent characteristics of cartilage tissue, such as the lack of vascularity and low cellular diversity, suggest that it would be one of the more simple tissues to be engineered, its functional weight-bearing role and implant viability and adaptation make this type of repair more complex. Over the last decade several therapeutic approaches and innovative techniques show promise for lasting and functional regeneration of hyaline cartilage. Here we will analyze the main strategies for cartilage regeneration and discuss our experience.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603517700954,Optimization of Degradation Profile for New Scaffold in Cartilage Repair,"Objective To establish whether a novel biomaterial scaffold with tunable degradation profile will aid in cartilage repair of chondral defects versus microfracture alone in vitro and in a rat model in vivo. Design In vitro—Short- and long-term degradation scaffolds were seeded with culture expanded articular chondrocytes or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Cell growth and differentiation were evaluated with cell morphological studies and gene expression studies. In vivo—A microfracture rat model was used in this study to evaluate the repair of cartilage and subchondral bone with the contralateral knee serving as the empty control. The treatment groups include (1) empty osteochondral defect, (2) polycaprolactone copolymer–based polyester polyurethane–urea (PSPU-U) caffold short-term degradative profile, and (3) PSPU-U scaffold long-term degradative profile. After placement of the scaffold, the rats were then allowed unrestricted activity as tolerated, and histological analyses were performed at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. The cartilage defect was measured and compared with the contralateral control side. Results In vitro—Long-term scaffolds showed statistically significant higher levels of aggrecan and type II collagen expression compared with short-term scaffolds. In vivo—Within 16 weeks postimplantation, there was new subchondral bone formation in both scaffolds. Short-term scaffolds had a statistically significant increase in defect filling and better qualitative histologic fill compared to control. Conclusions The PSPU short-term degradation scaffold may aid in cartilage repair by ultimately incorporating the scaffold into the microfracture procedure.",0
,Development and characteristics of pannus-like soft tissue in osteoarthritic articular surface in rat osteoarthritis model.,"Objectives Pannus is invasive granulation tissue found on the articular cartilage having rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, pannus-like tissue has also been found in osteoarthritis (OA). Our previous study showed that pannus-like tissue in OA (OA pannus) was frequently found in human OA samples. The purpose of the study is to investigate the development and the characteristics of OA pannus in a rat OA model. Design Ligaments of the knee joint were transected in Wister rats to induce OA. The knee joints were removed at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6, and subjected to histological study. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Safranin-O and immuno-stained for vimentin, CD34, type II collagen and MMP-3. The whole knee joint of OA rats was implanted in SCID mice and kept for a further 3 weeks. Then the histological findings were evaluated in HE sections. Result OA pannus appeared at week 2 and extend over the articular surface. OA pannus cells were positive for vimentin and/or CD34. At week 6, a part of articular surface was restored with matrix. OA pannus cells expressed MMP-3 as well as type II collagen. Histological study of rat OA knees implanted in SCID mice showed that OA pannus cells filled the joint space and invaded articular cartilage. Conclusions The presence of OA pannus was found in a rat OA model and its features were similar to those in human OA. OA pannus had both catabolic and reparative features, and the latter feature were speculated to be dominant in the later phase of the disease under a certain environmental condition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2017.10.005,Arthroscopic Treatment of Hip Chondral Defect With Microfracture and Platelet-Rich Plasma–Infused Micronized Cartilage Allograft Augmentation,"Over the past decade, arthroscopic microfracture has become increasingly popular to treat full-thickness (Outerbridge grade IV) chondral defects of the hip. This procedure borrows marrow stimulation treatment principles and techniques from knee arthroscopy, with similar mixed clinical outcomes that may be more favorable in the short term (<2 years) and poorer in the long term. Despite these varied outcomes, microfracture remains the most frequently used technique to treat small focal chondral defects because of the relative ease and cost-effectiveness of the procedure. Consequently, recent efforts have been aimed at improving or augmenting traditional microfracture to achieve more consistent success. BioCartilage (Arthrex, Naples, FL) is a biologically active scaffold containing allograft cartilage that, when combined with autologous conditioned platelet-rich plasma and placed in a defect in which microfracture was performed, may provide a superior repair that mimics native hyaline cartilage rather than the less-durable fibrocartilage that is formed with microfracture alone. This Technical Note and accompanying video review the pertinent techniques, pearls, and potential pitfalls of the microfracture procedure augmented with BioCartilage in the treatment of symptomatic full-thickness chondral defects of the hip.",0

Each patient received MR arthrography and clinical examination at mid-term (range 22-36 months) and long term (range 96-194 months) after surgery. MR arthrography was performed with dedicated coil and a 1.5-Tesla MR unit. The modified MOCART scale was used to evaluate the status of chondral implants. Implant coating, integration to the border zone, and the surface and structure of the repaired tissue were evaluated. Presence of bone marrow oedema was evaluated. The Cincinnati Knee Rating System (CKRS) was used for clinical assessment.At long term, 4/26 patients had complete alignment; 5/26 had a complete integration of the margins; in 4/26 cases, the implant surface was undamaged; in 14/26 cases, the reparative tissue was homogeneous. In 9/26 cases, the implant showed isointense signal compared to articular cartilage, while the presence of subchondral bone oedema was documented in 19/26 cases. The average radiological score decreased from 59.2 (mid-term) to 38.6 (long term). The average clinical score decreased from 8.9 to 8.3.Decrease in clinical results was not significant (0.6 points p = .06), but mMOCART scores decreased significantly (p = .00003). Although imaging studies showed deterioration of the grafts, the patients did not have significant clinical deterioration (231/250).",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/app11198923,Direct Perfusion Improves Redifferentiation of Human Chondrocytes in Fibrin Hydrogel with the Deposition of Cartilage Pericellular Matrix,"Articular cartilage has limited potential for self-repair, and cell-based strategies combining scaffolds and chondrocytes are currently used to treat cartilage injuries. However, achieving a satisfying level of cell redifferentiation following expansion remains challenging. Hydrogels and perfusion bioreactors are known to exert beneficial cues on chondrocytes; however, the effect of a combined approach on the quality of cartilage matrix deposited by cells is not fully understood. Here, we combined soluble factors (BMP-2, Insulin, and Triiodothyronine, that is, BIT), fibrin hydrogel, direct perfusion and human articular chondrocytes (HACs) to engineer large cartilage tissues. Following cell expansion, cells were embedded in fibrin gels and cultivated under either static or perfusion conditions. The nature of the matrix synthesized was assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The stability of cartilage grafts and integration with native tissue were also investigated by subcutaneous implantation of human osteochondral cylinders in nude mice. Perfusion preconditioning improved matrix quality and spatial distribution. Specifically, perfusion preconditioning resulted in a matrix rich in type II collagen but not in type I collagen, indicating the reconstruction of hyaline cartilage. Remarkably, the production of type VI collagen, the main component of the pericellular matrix, was also increased, indicating that chondrocytes were connecting to the hyaline matrix they produced.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603519841673,Accurate Reporting of Concomitant Procedures Is Highly Variable in Studies Investigating Knee Cartilage Restoration,"Successful clinical outcomes following cartilage restoration procedures are highly dependent on addressing concomitant pathology. The purpose of this study was to document methods for evaluating concomitant procedures of the knee when performed with articular cartilage restoration techniques, and to review their reported findings in high-impact clinical orthopedic studies. We hypothesized that there are substantial inconsistencies in reporting clinical outcomes associated with concomitant procedures relative to outcomes related to isolated cartilage repair.A total of 133 clinical studies on articular cartilage repair of the knee were identified from 6 high-impact orthopedic journals between 2011 and 2017. Studies were included if they were primary research articles reporting clinical outcomes data following surgical treatment of articular cartilage lesions with a minimum sample size of 5 patients. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, meta-analyses, and articles reporting only nonclinical outcomes (e.g., imaging, histology). A full-text review was then used to evaluate details regarding study methodology and reporting on the following variables: primary cartilage repair procedure, and the utilization of concomitant procedures to address additional patient comorbidities, including malalignment, meniscus pathology, and ligamentous instability. Each study was additionally reviewed to document variation in clinical outcomes reporting in patients that had these comorbidities addressed at the time of surgery.All studies reported on the type of primary cartilage repair procedure, with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) noted in 43% of studies, microfracture (MF) reported in 16.5%, osteochondral allograft (OCA) in 15%, and osteochondral autograft transplant (OAT) in 8.2%. Regarding concomitant pathology, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (24.8%) and meniscus repair (23.3%) were the most commonly addressed patient comorbidities. A total of 56 studies (42.1%) excluded patients with malalignment, meniscus injury, and ligamentous instability. For studies that addressed concomitant pathology, 72.7% reported clinical outcomes separately from the cohort treated with only cartilage repair. A total of 16.5% of studies neither excluded nor addressed concomitant pathologies. There was a significant amount of variation in the patient reported outcome scores used among the studies, with the majority of studies reporting International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) in 47.2% and 43.6% of articles, respectively.In this study on knee cartilage restoration, recognition and management of concomitant pathology is inadequately reported in approximately 28% of studies. Only 30% of articles reported adequate treatment of concomitant ailments while scoring their outcomes using one of a potential 18 different scoring systems. These findings highlight the need for more standardized methods to be applied in future research with regard to inclusion, exclusion, and scoring concomitant pathologies with regard to treatment of cartilage defects in the knee.",0
,Has the Standard of the Reporting of Rehabilitation Improved in Articular Cartilage Repair Studies Involving Third-Generation Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in the Knee? A Systematic Review.,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a tissue-engineered surgical technique initially developed for articular cartilage repair of isolated chondral lesions of the knee. Third generation techniques (ACI3) are now available that deliver autologous cultured chondrocytes into the defect using cell scaffolds. The successful outcomes of these techniques have some dependency on the pre and post-surgical patient rehabilitation.To determine if the standard of reporting for rehabilitation has improved in ACI3 studies; previous reviews in this field recommended describing the detail of this rehabilitation and patient compliance as integral elements.A computerized search was performed in March 2013. Criteria for inclusion were any studies that evaluated or described the process of ACI3 in the knee and subsequent rehabilitation. The modified Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) was used to rate the standard of reporting of rehabilitation and surgical procedures; review articles were also evaluated for quality using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT). Mean scores, odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and Mann-Whitney U statistics were calculated.An improvement in mean CMS was seen compared to previous reviews but rehabilitation reporting scores were lower than their surgical equivalent; significant association was seen between those studies with rehabilitator involvement and high scores in the individual CMS rehabilitation element. Predominant SORT scores of 2A indicated medium strength of recommendation.The CMS provides a general overview of methodological quality but a more specialised tool to report on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the rehabilitation process would assist in raising the standards. It is recommended that rehabilitation therapists are included as key members of research teams and are involved in the design, implementation and reporting of future studies.",0

Currently, there is no effective non-surgical treatment for articular cartilage injury. Arthroscopic debridement and microfracture surgery are performed for fibrocartilage repair. But fibrocartilage is different from normal articular cartilage, and functional recovery is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective techniques for articular cartilage repair. Progress in material science, cell biology, biomechanics, and bioreactor technology has allowed the development of biomimetic, tissue-engineered osteochondral composites that have shown potential for the repair of damaged cartilage. We prepared biomimetic, tissue-engineered cartilage scaffolds optimized for biochemical composition and structural characteristics. Based on the experience of our pre-clinical studies on animals, a human articular cartilage acellular matrix scaffold was prepared and is in clinical use. The combination of autologous chondrocytes and scaffolds has shown satisfactory results in repairing cartilage defects in preliminary experiments.This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. One hundred patients with full-thickness cartilage injury of the knee will be randomly divided into two groups to receive treatment with either tissue-engineered cartilage constructed using biomimetic cartilage extracellular-matrix-oriented scaffolds combined with autologous chondrocytes, or arthroscopic debridement and microfracture surgery. There will be five visiting time points: at baseline, then at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. The primary outcome will be therapeutic efficacy as assessed by the Lysholm score at 12 months postoperatively. The secondary outcomes will be the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Visual Analog Scale score, and cartilage injury and repair as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging as well as the incidence of postoperative adverse events.This trial will attempt to verify the use of tissue-engineered cartilage constructed using autologous chondrocytes combined with allogeneic, acellular cartilage matrix for the repair of cartilage defects, thereby providing favorable evidence for its use in clinical practice.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02770209 .

We hypothesized that conventionally passaged SDSCs can be engineered in vitro into cartilage tissue constructs and the engineered premature tissue can be implanted to repair allogeneic full-thickness femoral condyle cartilage defects without immune rejection.Synovial tissue was harvested from rabbit knee joints. Passage 3 SDSCs were mixed with fibrin glue and seeded into non-woven polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh. After 1-month incubation with growth factor cocktails, the premature tissue was implanted into rabbit knees to repair osteochondral defects with Collagraft as a bone substitute in the Construct group. Fibrin glue-saturated PGA/Collagraft composites were used as a Scaffold group. The defect was left untreated as an Empty group.SDSCs were engineered in rotating bioreactor systems into premature cartilage, which displayed the expression of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG), collagen II, collagen I, and macrophages. Six months after implantation with premature tissue, cartilage defects were full of smooth hyaline-like cartilage with no detectable collagen I and macrophages but a high expression of collagen II and GAG, which were also integrated with the surrounding native cartilage. The Scaffold and Empty groups were resurfaced with fibrous-like and fibrocartilage tissue, respectively.Allogeneic SDSC-based premature tissue constructs are a promising stem cell-based approach for cartilage defects. Although in vitro data suggest that contaminated macrophages affected the quality of SDSC-based premature cartilage, effects of macrophages on in vivo tissue regeneration and integration necessitate further investigation.",0

However, ACI requires sutured periosteal flaps to secure the cells, which precludes minimally-invasive implantation, and introduces complications with arthrofibrosis and graft hypertrophy. This study evaluated ACI on a collagen type I/III scaffold (matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation; MACI(®)) in critical sized defects in the equine model.Chondrocytes were isolated from horses, expanded and seeded onto a collagen I/III membrane (ACI-Maix™) and implanted into one of two 15-mm defects in the femoral trochlear ridge of six horses. Control defects remained empty as ungrafted debrided defects. The animals were examined daily, scored by second look arthroscopy at 12 weeks, and necropsy examination 6 months after implantation. Reaction to the implant was determined by lameness, and synovial fluid constituents and synovial membrane histology. Cartilage healing was assessed by arthroscopic scores, gross assessment, repair tissue histology and immunohistochemistry, cartilage glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and DNA assay, and mechanical testing.MACI(®) implanted defects had improved arthroscopic second-look, gross healing, and composite histologic scores, compared to spontaneously healing empty defects. Cartilage GAG and DNA content in the defects repaired by MACI implant were significantly improved compared to controls. Mechanical properties were improved but remained inferior to normal cartilage. There was minimal evidence of reaction to the implant in the synovial fluid, synovial membrane, subchondral bone, or cartilage.The MACI(®) implant appeared to improve cartilage healing in a critical sized defect in the equine model evaluated over 6 months.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.10.016,Pore size directs bone marrow stromal cell fate and tissue regeneration in nanofibrous macroporous scaffolds by mediating vascularization,"In the U.S., 30% of adults suffer joint pain, most commonly in the knee, which severely limits mobility and is often attributed to injury of cartilage and underlying bone in the joint. Current treatment methods such as microfracture result in less resilient fibrocartilage with eventual failure; autografting can cause donor site morbidity and poor integration. To overcome drawbacks in treatment, tissue engineers can design cell-instructive biomimetic scaffolds using biocompatible materials as alternate therapies for osteochondral defects. Nanofibrous poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds of uniform, spherical, interconnected and well-defined pore sizes that are fabricated using a thermally-induced phase separation and sugar porogen template method create an extracellular matrix-like environment which facilitates cell adhesion and proliferation. Herein we report that chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification of rabbit and human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be controlled by scaffold pore architecture, particularly pore size. Small-pore scaffolds support enhanced chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and cartilage formation in vivo compared to large-pore scaffolds. Endochondral ossification is prevented in scaffolds with very small pore sizes; pore interconnectivity is critical to promote capillary ingrowth for mature bone formation. These results provide a novel strategy to control tissue regenerative processes by tunable architecture of macroporous nanofibrous scaffolds. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Progress in understanding the relationship between cell fate and architectural features of tissue engineering scaffolds is critical for engineering physiologically functional tissues. Sugar porogen template scaffolds have uniform, spherical, highly interconnected macropores. Tunable pore-size guides the fate of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) towards chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification, and is a critical design parameter to mediate neotissue vascularization. Preventing vascularization favors a chondrogenic cell fate while allowing vascularization results in endochondral ossification and mineralized bone formation. These results provide a novel strategy to control tissue regenerative processes by tunable architecture of macroporous nanofibrous scaffolds.",0

The type of study was case series. From October 1990 to June 1995, eight cases underwent allogenic or autogenic meniscus transplantations for articular cartilage defects, and seven cases were available for follow-up evaluations. The age at surgery ranged from 14 to 42 years of age (average 22.5). In one case, transplantation of tissue-engineered cartilage was performed due to pain 5 years after surgery. The other six cases were followed up for 8-13 years (average 10.1). The size of the cartilage defect ranged from 1.0 to 6.3 cm2 (average 2.8 cm2). Patients were evaluated with the Lysholm score and MR images. We also performed arthroscopic examinations in three cases at the final evaluation. This study leads to the conclusion that meniscus transplantation for articular cartilage damage is not comparable to autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Two cases showed a good clinical outcome but the tissue remained as fibrocartilage tissue in the long-term.",0

METHODS: The research was performed on the PubMed database considering the English literature from 2002 and using the following key words: cartilage, cartilage repair, mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs, bone marrow concentrate (BMC), bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and synovial-derived mesenchymal stem cells. RESULTS: The systematic research showed an increasing number of published studies on this topic over time and identified 72 preclinical papers and 18 clinical trials. Among the 18 clinical trials identified focusing on cartilage regeneration, none were randomized, five were comparative, six were case series, and seven were case reports; two concerned the use of adipose-derived MSCs, five the use of BMC, and 11 the use of bone marrow-derived MSCs, with preliminary interesting findings ranging from focal chondral defects to articular osteoarthritis degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the growing interest in this biological approach for cartilage regeneration, knowledge on this topic is still preliminary, as shown by the prevalence of preclinical studies and the presence of low-quality clinical studies. Many aspects have to be optimized, and randomized controlled trials are needed to support the potential of this biological treatment for cartilage repair and to evaluate advantages and disadvantages with respect to the available treatments.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-007-0097-z,Treatment of Focal Articular Cartilage Defects in the Knee,"We asked whether autologous chondrocyte implantation or osteochondral autograft transfer yields better clinical outcomes compared with one another or with traditional abrasive techniques for treatment of isolated articular cartilage defects and whether lesion size influences this clinical outcome. We performed a literature search and identified five randomized, controlled trials and one prospective comparative trial evaluating these treatment techniques in 421 patients. The operative procedures included autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft transfer, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation, and microfracture. Minimum followup was 1 year (mean, 1.7 years; range, 1-3 years). All studies documented greater than 95% followup for clinical outcome measures. No technique consistently had superior results compared with the others. Outcomes for microfracture tended to be worse in larger lesions. All studies reported improvement in clinical outcome measures in all treatment groups when compared with preoperative assessment; however, no control (nonoperative) groups were used in any of the studies. A large prospective trial investigating these techniques with the addition of a control group would be the best way to definitively address the clinical questions.Level II, therapeutic study.

Autologous OC mosaicplasty has proven to be a valid therapeutic option but donor site morbidity and the lack of long-term functionality remain sources of concern. OC tissue engineering has shown an increasing development to provide suitable strategies for the regeneration of damaged cartilage and underlying subchondral bone tissue. The use of two scaffolds with optimized properties for bone and cartilage architectures combined at the time of implantation as a multilayered structure was one of the first approaches for OC large defects regeneration. Last decade strategies using a bony-like scaffold supporting a cell layer for cartilage phase were introduced. Beyond the approaches already mentioned, three other strategies were reported for OCD regeneration. One methodology was the use of two different layers with a compact interface to create an integrated bilayered scaffold before cell seeding. A second strategy was the use of a single continuous structure but with different features in each layer. The last one was the combination of hydrogel phases creating this way the possibility to have injectable systems. These promising strategies for the regeneration of complex OCDs comprise the use of different biomaterials, growth factors, and cells alone or in combination, but the ideal solution is still to be found. The interface's mechanical properties have to be optimized. A different problem is related with the cell culture method within the 3D bilayered structures with heterogeneous properties. With the increasing demand of these stratified 3D structures new cell culture systems are required. Moreover these structures present the potential to be used as in vitro models, which is a need also because of the pressure resulting from the 3R's principle implementation that is now occurring. Regarding this, adapted bioreactors are being developed, but more efforts are required to target this scientific demand.",0

Design A list of 24 questions was devised based on the current MACI rehabilitation protocol, literature review, and discussion with orthopedic surgeons. Known areas of variability were used to establish 4 consensus domains, stratified on lesion location (tibiofemoral [TF] or patellofemoral [PF]), including weightbearing (WB), range of motion (ROM), return to work/daily activities of living, and return to sports. A 3-step Delphi technique was used to establish consensus. Results Consensus (&gt;75% agreement) was achieved on all 4 consensus domains. Time to full WB was agreed as immediate (with bracing) for PF patients (dependent on concomitant procedures), and 7 to 9 weeks in TF patients. A progression for ROM was agreed that allowed patients to reach 90° by week 4, with subsequent progression as tolerated. The panel estimated that the time to full ROM would be 7 to 9 weeks on average. A range of time was established for release to activities of daily living, work, and sports, dependent on lesion and patient characteristics. Conclusions Good consensus was established among a panel of U.S. surgeons for rehabilitation practices following MACI treatment of knee cartilage lesions. The consensus of experts can aid surgeons and patients in the expectations and rehabilitation process as MACI surgery becomes more prevalent in the United States.",0

This prospective study analyzes a clinical outcome of 70 consecutive patients treated by arthroscopic autologous chondrocyte transplantation at minimum 24 months follow up (47 of these patients achieved minimum 36 months follow-up and 21 patients minimum 48 months follow-up) in order to establish clear indication criteria for this type of treatment. 31 of these patients presented isolated chondral lesions, while 39 patients with associated lesions (23 ACL lesions, 28 meniscal lesions, 1 varus knee) were treated during the same surgical procedure with cartilage harvesting. A statistically significant clinical improvement was shown just at 24 months and the second-look arthroscopy demonstrated a complete coverage of the grafted area with a hyaline cartilage-like tissue in 12 of 15 analyzed patients. A better clinical outcome was observed in young, well-trained patients and in traumatic lesions. Other factors, such as defect size, localization, previous and associated surgery did not influence significantly the results. This matrix autologous chondrocyte transplantation procedure simplifies the surgical procedure and can be performed arthroscopically, thus reducing surgical morbidity and recovery time.",0

The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological results of two different scaffolds with hyaluronan- or chitosan-based structure used in the treatment of symptomatic condylar osteochondral lesions. The study comprises 69 patients who were operated for osteochondral lesion repair with hyaluronan- (n = 37) or chitosan-based (n = 32) scaffold. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were collected for both groups at the preoperative and postoperative 3rd, 12th, and 24th months. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed between the 12th and 15th months postoperatively and this with magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring were compared. Within group assessments demonstrate significant improvement in IKDC, Lysholm, and VAS scores at postoperative 3rd and 12th months. However, in both groups, IKDC, Lysholm and, VAS scores at the postoperative 24th month indicate no significant further improvement, compared with the 12th month results. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of IKDC, Lysholm, VAS, and MOCART scores at any time period. This study shows that both scaffolds are useful in cartilage regeneration but have no clinical or radiological superiority to each other. Surgeons should select the method with which they feel comfortable. This is a level III, retrospective comparative study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0751,Repair of Cartilage Defects in Arthritic Tissue with Differentiated Human Embryonic Stem Cells,"Chondrocytes have been generated in vitro from a range of progenitor cell types and by a number of strategies. However, achieving reconstitution of actual physiologically relevant, appropriately-laminated cartilage in situ that would be applicable to conditions, such as arthritis and cartilage degeneration remains elusive. This lack of success is multifactorial and includes limited cell source, decreased proliferation rate of mature chondrocytes, lack of maintenance of phenotype, reduced matrix synthesis, and poor integration with host tissue. We report an efficient approach for deriving mesenchymal chondroprogenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells. These cells generated tissue containing cartilage-specific matrix proteins that integrated in situ in a partial-thickness defect in ex vivo articular cartilage harvested from human arthritic joints. Given that stem cells provide a virtually inexhaustible supply of starting material and that our technique is easily scalable, cartilaginous tissue primed and grafted in this manner could be suitable for clinical translation.",0

In this open-label phase 1 study, patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) received a single intra-articular injection of autologous IFP-MSCs. Safety was assessed through physical examination of the knee joint, vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events. Efficacy was evaluated with regard to pain and function using questionnaires, x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in IFP-MSCs primed with interferon gamma was used as an in vitro potency measurement in investigating the correlations of clinical outcomes.Twelve patients with symptomatic knee OA were recruited. IFP adipose tissue was harvested from each patient's knee through surgical excision for IFP-MSC manufacturing. Cryopreserved IFP-MSCs (5 × 107 cells) were injected into the knee joint immediately after thawing.No significant adverse events were observed. Patients who received IFP-MSCs exhibited clinically significant pain and functional improvement at 48-week follow-up. The MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score average was also significantly reduced from 100.2 before injection to 85.0 at 48 weeks after injection. The IDO expression of the primed IFP-MSCs of the 12 patients was correlated with clinical outcomes after injection.A single intra-articular injection of IFP-MSCs appears to be a safe therapy for treating knee OA and may improve disease symptoms. IDO measurement of primed IFP-MSCs has potential as a potency marker of MSC products for immunomodulatory therapy.",0

https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2016.1255484,No degeneration found in focal cartilage defects evaluated with dGEMRIC at 12-year follow-up,"Background and purpose - The natural history of focal cartilage defects (FCDs) is still unresolved, as is the long-term cartilage quality after cartilage surgery. It has been suggested that delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) is a biomarker of early OA. We aimed to quantitatively evaluate the articular cartilage in knees with FCDs, 12 years after arthroscopic diagnosis. Patients and methods - We included 21 patients from a cohort of patients with knee pain who underwent arthroscopy in 1999. Patients with a full-thickness cartilage defect, stable knees, and at least 50% of both their menisci intact at baseline were eligible. 10 patients had cartilage repair performed at baseline (microfracture or autologous chondrocyte implantation), whereas 11 patients had either no additional surgery or simple debridement performed. Mean follow-up time was 12 (10-13) years. The morphology and biochemical features were evaluated with dGEMRIC and T2 mapping. Standing radiographs for Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) classification of osteoarthritis (OA) were obtained. Knee function was assessed with VAS, Tegner, Lysholm, and KOOS. Results - The dGEMRIC showed varying results but, overall, no increased degeneration of the injured knees. Degenerative changes (K&L above 0) were, however, evident in 13 of the 21 knees. Interpretation - The natural history of untreated FCDs shows large dGEMRIC variations, as does the knee articular cartilage of surgically treated patients. In this study, radiographic OA changes did not correlate with cartilage quality, as assessed with dGEMRIC.",0

At two and five years, MRI defect filling was more complete in the AMIC® groups. No treatment-related adverse events were reported.AMIC® is an effective cartilage repair procedure in the knee resulting in stable clinical results significantly better than the MFx group at five years.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2018.08.004,New biotechnologies for musculoskeletal injuries,"The practice of any sport is inherently associated with the risk of musculoskeletal lesions. We describe regenerative medicine technologies, including cellular therapies, gene therapies and multimolecular preparations of growth factors and cytokines, which are expected to advance the field of orthopaedics and sports medicine. Gene therapy involves the introduction of genetic information in the injured tissue to help that tissue to heal and, possibly, regenerate. Cell therapies used in clinical practice are based on the transplantation of adult human cells, which can be at different stages of differentiation. Currently, the stromal vascular fraction, containing stem cells and other niche components, has been injected in the articular cartilage of the knee or delivered via arthroscopy. Bone marrow concentrate (BMC) has been used to manage focal chondral defects via arthroscopy with promising clinical results. In addition, purified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been injected or delivered as an adjuvant to arthroscopic microfractures, and patients have shown improved clinical outcomes. Laboratory-expanded MSCs injected in osteoarthritis moderately improved pain and functional outcomes. MSC treatment in the form of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or BMC or laboratory expanded adhesive cells (bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, BM-MSCs and ADSCs) has been proven to be safe. Despite their safety, expensive regulatory complexities required to implement cell-based therapies make these treatments unavailable for most patients. At present, although some results are promising, all biological interventions are experimental, and cost/efficacy has not been demonstrated yet. Moreover, short follow-up in most studies questions the durability of treatments.",0

A literature review was carried out in the main medical databases to evaluate the several studies concerning ACI treatment of large-sized and full-thickness knee cartilage defects in young adults. ACI technique has been shown to relieve symptoms and improve functional assessment in large-sized (\textbackslashtextgreater 4 cm(2)) and full-thickness knee articular cartilage defect of young adults in short- and medium-term follow-up. Besides, low level of evidence demonstrated its efficiency and durability at long-term follow-up after implantation. Furthermore, MRI and histological evaluations provided the evidence that graft can return back to the previous nearly normal cartilage via ACI techniques. Clinical outcomes tend to be similar in different ACI techniques, but with simplified procedure, low complication rate and better graft quality in the third-generation ACI technique. ACI based on the experience of cell-based therapy, with the high potential to regenerate hyaline-like tissue, represents clinical development in treatment of large-sized and full-thickness knee cartilage defects.

Hydrogel-based autologous chondrocyte implantation using an in situ polymerizable biomaterial is a relatively new treatment option for arthroscopic cartilage defects. It is therefore important to determine if there are significant differences in the outcomes. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes (using subjective parameters) of hydrogel-based autologous chondrocyte implantation (NOVOCART® Inject) with the outcomes of scaffold based autologous chondrocyte Implantation (NOVOCART® 3D) using biphasic collagen scaffold.The data of 50 patients, which were paired with 25 patients in each treatment group, was analyzed. The main parameters used for matching were gender, number of defects and localization. Both groups were compared based on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and subjective IKDC scores, both of which were examined pre-operatively and after 6, 12 and 24 months.Significant benefits in both VAS and IKDC scores after 2 years of follow-up in both groups were found. Comparing the groups, the results showed that in the hydrogel-based autologous chondrocyte implantation group, significant changes in IKDC scores are measurable after 6 months, while it takes 12 months until they are seen in the scaffold based autologous chondrocyte group.Hydrogel-based autologous chondrocyte and scaffold based autologous chondrocyte show comparable improvements and significant benefits to the patients' subjective well-being after a 2-year-follow-up.III.",0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cytocompatibility of this biomaterial using human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human chondrocytes. Moreover, the preliminary data of five patients affected by chondral lesion of the talus treated with the ACIC technique are shown. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human chondrocytes were seeded on solid and pre-solid atelocollagen scaffolds. Cell-scaffold constructs were cultured for 7 days and then prepared for histological analyses. Arthroscopic ACIC was performed in five patients affected by chondral lesions of the talus; they were clinically evaluated with AOFAS, VAS and Tegner score before and then after 6 months from surgery. In vitro results showed that both bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes were able to efficiently colonize the whole construct, from the surface to the core, only when seeded on the pre-solid atelocollagen scaffold, but not on its solid form. No adverse events were observed in the patients treated with the ACIC technique; a significant improvement in VAS pain scale and in AOFAS score was found at 6 months follow up. Injectable atelocollagen can be considered a feasible scaffold for cartilage repair treatment, in particular if used in its pre-solid form. ACIC leads to good clinical results in the treatment for chondral lesions of the talus even if longer follow-up and a higher number of patients are necessary to confirm these data. IV.",0

Studies included were all prospective studies that reported on activity-based outcome measures such as Tegner activity scores and subjective outcomes such as the International Knee Documentation Committee score. Failure rates, as determined by the publishing authors, were recorded for each study. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Paired standardized mean differences (Hedges's g to account for small sample bias) were used for continuous outcome measures, and risk ratios (Mantel-Haenszel method for small sample bias) for dichotomous outcome measures.Six prospective studies satisfied the eligibility criteria and included 249 patients (186 male, 120 female) with an average age of 26.4 years and follow-up of 67.2 months. Tegner scores were superior in patients treated with OAT compared with MFX (ΔOAT-MFX for pre-post scores = 0.94 Tegner points, standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.469, P = .005). Failure rates of MFX were higher than OAT (OAT = 11%, MFX = 32%, risk ratio = 2.42, P < .036). OAT was superior to MFX at 3 years in relation to subjective outcome scores (SMD = 0.404, P = .008). When assessing OAT lesions larger than 3 cm2, OAT was superior to MFX with respect to activity level (SMD = 0.506, P = .001).OAT may achieve higher activity levels and lower risk of failure when compared with MFX for cartilage lesions greater than 3 cm2 in the knee, although there was no significant difference for lesions less than 3 cm2 at midterm. However, because of variability in patient-specific factors such as age, preinjury activity level, lesion location and size, the superiority of OAT over MFX cannot be generalized to all patient populations and therefore requires individualized patient care.Level II, meta-analysis of Level I and II studies.",0

Since the number of progenitors in Mfx is low and may further decrease with age, aim of our study was to analyze the chondrogenic potential of freeze-dried polyglycolic acid-hyaluronan (PGA-HA) implants preloaded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro and in a rabbit articular cartilage defect model. Human bone marrow-derived MSC from iliac crest were cultured in freeze-dried PGA-HA implants for chondrogenic differentiation. In a pilot study, implants were loaded with autologous rabbit MSC and used to cover 5 mm × 6 mm full-thickness femoral articular cartilage defects (n = 4). Untreated defects (n = 3) served as controls. Gene expression analysis and histology showed induction of typical chondrogenic marker genes like type II collagen and formation of hyaline-like cartilaginous tissue in MSC-laden PGA-HA implants. Histological evaluation of rabbit repair tissue formation after 30 and 45 days showed formation of repair tissue, rich in chondrocytic cells and of a hyaline-like appearance. Controls showed no articular resurfacing, tissue repair in the subchondral zone and fibrin formation. These results suggest that MSC-laden PGA-HA scaffolds have chondrogenic potential and are a promising option for stem cell-mediated cartilage regeneration. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

All documented autologous chondrocyte implantation, autologous osteochondral transfer, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and marrow stimulation techniques (MSTs) procedures were analyzed. Analysis was performed to describe trends in annual incidence, types of complications, concomitant procedures, and geographical differences in incidence of advanced cartilage procedures.From 2003 to 2015, a total of 2,827 surgeons submitted 7,522 cartilage restoration procedures, with 7,060 cases documented as MST (80.01%). The number of cartilage cases decreased significantly from 2003 to in 2015 (P <.001), with MST having the largest decline (P < .001). The incidence of open osteochondral allograft transplantation (odds ratio = 1.35; P = .023) and open autologous osteochondral transfer (odds ratio = 0.84; P = .004) increased over the study period. Overall, the majority of patients (57.0%) were male; however, female patients were on average significantly older than male patients (P < .001). Cartilage procedures were performed concomitantly with a realignment osteotomy procedure in 1.7% of cases. The incidence of surgical complications increased throughout the study period from 2.9% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2015 (P < .001).Cartilage restoration procedures, specifically MSTs, are being decreasingly performed among recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In contrast, complication rates have been increasing since 2003, demonstrating a possible paradigm shift toward more complex cartilage procedures, specifically osteochondral grafting procedures.This study demonstrates a significant decline in the use of MSTs by recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In addition, an increase in several more complex cartilage restoration procedures was found. Taken in sum, these changes may reflect a shift in residency and fellowship training away from marrow stimulation procedures that elicit a fibrocartilage reparative tissue and toward more complex procedures that provide a more hyaline-like articular cartilage surface.",0

Improvement in mean subjective score from preoperative (37.6) to 12 months (56.4) and 24 (60.1) months post-ACI were observed. Knee function levels also improved [86% International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) III/IV to 66.6% I/II] from preoperative period to 24 months postimplantation. Objective IKDC score of A or B were observed in 88% preoperatively. This decreased to 67.9% at 3 months before improving to 92.5% at 12 months and 94.4% at 24 months post implantation. Transient deterioration in all these clinical scores was observed at 3 months before progressive improvement became evident. MRI studies demonstrated 75.3% with at least 50% defect fill, 46.3% with near normal signal, 68.1% with mild/no effusion and also 66.7% with mild/no underlying bone marrow oedema at 3 months. These values improved to 94.2%, 86.9%, 91.3% and 88.4%, respectively, at 12 months. At 24 months, further improvements to 97%, 97%, 95.6% and 92.6%, respectively, were observed. Second-look arthroscopy carried out in 22 knees (32 lesions) demonstrated all grafts to be normal/nearly normal based on the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual repair assessment while core biopsies from 20 lesions demonstrated 13 grafts to have hyaline/hyaline-like tissue. Improvement in clinical and MRI findings obtained from second-look arthroscopy and core biopsies evaluated indicate that, at 24 months post-ACI, the resurfaced focal chondral defects of the knee remained intact and continued to function well.",0

The aim of this study is to assess the outcome of patients treated with differentiated to chondrocytes bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) cultured on a collagen type I/III (Chondro-Gide®) scaffold. The secondary aim was to confirm the absence of adverse events. Methods Fifteen patients (19 knees) with symptomatic full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee were enrolled. Bone marrow was harvested from the iliac crest, BM-MSCs were prepared, and expanded cells were grown in a standard medium or in a standard culture medium containing TGF-β. BM-MSCs differentiated to chondrocytes were seeded in a porcine collagen type I/III scaffold (Chondro-Gide®) and cultured in TGF-β containing media. After 4 weeks, the membrane was sutured on the cartilage defect. All patients underwent plain radiographs (antero-posterior, lateral, and axial view of the patella) and MRI of the affected knee. The Oxford knee score, the Lyhsolm scale, and the VAS score were administered to all patients. At final follow-up a MRI for the study of articular cartilage was undertaken. Results The mean size of the cartilage lesions was 20 × 17 mm (range, 15 × 10 mm–30 × 30 mm). At final follow-up, the median Oxford knee score and Lyhsolm scale scores significantly improved from 29 (range 12–39; SD 7.39) to 45 (range 24–48; SD 5.6) and from 55.5 (range 25–81; SD 17.7) to 94.5 (58–100; SD 10.8), respectively. Pain, according to the VAS score, significantly improved. Sixty percent of patients reported their satisfaction as excellent, 20% as good, 14% as fair, and 1 patient as poor. Conclusion The treatment of full-thickness chondral injuries of the knee with differentiated to chondrocytes BM-MSCs and Chondro-Gide® scaffold showed encouraging outcomes. Further studies involving more patients, and with longer follow-up, are required to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and the long-term results.",0
https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm_00000151,Long-term effects of chondrospheres on cartilage lesions in an autologous chondrocyte implantation model as investigated in the SCID mouse model,"Microtraumata often lead to articular cartilage lesions. Due to the bradytrophic character of hyaline cartilage, these lesions are hardly repaired by the organism. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) was established for restoring isolated structural cartilage defects in knee joints. However, results are not always convincing. Human chondrocytes from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were cultured in monolayer followed by condensing single chondrocytes to spheroids (chondrospheres®). The integrative capacity of chondrospheres was examined by implanting them into lesions in human articular cartilage specimens and co-implanting them into SCID mice. Mice were sacrificed after 4, 12 and 24 weeks. HE and safranin O staining as well as immunohistochemistry using anti-S100, anti-collagen I and II antibodies were performed and analyzed using semiquantitative scores. Integration of the chondrospheres with the (native) cartilage matrix was analyzed by determining the percentage of adhering surface. With respect to long-term stability, the chondrocytes within chondrospheres showed a typical chondrocytic morphology. Immunohistochemically, a high collagen II production was detected. Over a time period of 24 weeks, an increasing content of collagen type II, glycosaminoglycans and collagenous fibers were found. Importantly, the newly synthesized cartilaginous matrix integrated continuously with the native cartilage lesion border. In conclusion, the presented data demonstrate that chondrospheres are able to restore and conserve their phenotype for at least 24 weeks under in vivo conditions. Moreover, chondrospheres adhere to full-thickness cartilage defects and appear to produce a cartilaginous extracellular matrix which fuses with native cartilage thus generating an autologous cartilage-like repair tissue.",0

The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome in terms of rate and level of return to sport in a group of competitive athletes who underwent matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT), as well as the impact on their athletic career.MethodsThirty-one male patients (mean age 22.66.3years) p racticing sport at competitive level, affected by focal chondral/osteochondral lesions of the distal femur, were enrolled and treated with arthroscopic hyaluronan-based MACT. Patients were evaluated prospectively at 1-year intervals with the IKDC subjective, Tegner, and EuroQol VAS scores during their pre-operative visit and subsequent follow-ups for up to 10years. Return to sport in terms of level, time and maintenance of the activity level was documented, together with surgical or clinical failures.ResultsA marked improvement in all scores was found: IKDC increased from 40.313.4 to 81.7 +/- 14.4 (p\textbackslashtextless0.0005) at 12 months; a further improvement was observed at 2years (89.5 +/- 11.3; p=0.008), then results were stable for up to 10years (87.3 +/- 13.6). The analysis of return to sport documented that 64.5% of patients were able to return at a competitive level, and 58.1% performed at the same pre-injury level, with activity rates decreasing over time. The rate of patients returning to competitive level was 84% in those without previous surgery (vs. 33% who had undergone previous surgery), 87% for those with traumatic lesions (vs. 33% and 50% for degenerative and OCD lesions, respectively), and 92.3% in younger patients (age\textbackslashtextless20years). Among these factors, multivariate analysis demonstrated that previous surgery was the single most influencing factor for returning to the same sport level (p=0.010).Conclusionsp id=Par4These long-term results showed that chondrocyte-based regenerative approach has some limitations in terms of sport-related outcomes. The level of high functional knee restoration needed for such high-demanding activity level can be challenging to achieve, especially in patients with a more compromised joint homeostasis. Return to sport rate varies significantly according to specific patient and lesion characteristics and best results are obtained in young patients with traumatic lesions without previous surgery, which should be considered when treating athletes affected by cartilage lesions.Level of evidencep id=Par5 IV.",0

Hypothesis A comprehensive protocol after MACI on the femoral condyle with accelerated weightbearing leads to a better functional and radiographic outcome compared with the same comprehensive protocol with delayed weightbearing. Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods Thirty-one patients (22 male, 9 female) after MACI on the femoral condyle were randomly assigned to the accelerated weightbearing group (group A) or the delayed weightbearing group (group B). Aside from increase and time of full weightbearing, both groups adhered to the same rehabilitation protocol and exercises. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 4, 12, 24, 52, and 104 weeks after surgery. Clinical evaluation was performed by determining the subjective form of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Tegner activity scale, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Radiological outcome was evaluated by the MOCART score and the size and amount of bone marrow edema and effusion. Results In both groups, there were no differences with regard to the clinical outcome. For the radiological outcome, group A showed a higher prevalence of bone marrow edema after 6 months without correlation to the clinical outcome (P 5 .06-.1). However, after 104 weeks, there were no differences in the radiological outcome between group A and group B. Conclusion A rehabilitation protocol with accelerated weightbearing leads to good clinical and functional outcome after 2 years without jeopardizing the healing graft.",1

Lesions arising in the tibial plateau are rarely described.To present a case series of OCD lesions of the tibial plateau.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Medical records and diagnostic imaging of patients <20 years of age with confirmed diagnosis of OCD of the tibial plateau from a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Characteristic and radiographic features as well as details of both nonoperative and surgical management were investigated. Lesion characteristics and treatment outcomes were also analyzed.A total of 9 lesions were identified in 9 patients (5 females, 4 males) who fit the inclusion criteria. The mean age at diagnosis was 14.2 years (range, 9-17 years). Knee pain (8/9) of longer than 1 year in duration was the most common presenting symptom. All 9 lesions were located on the lateral tibial plateau, and concomitant lateral compartment pathology was present in 5 of 9 patients (4 lateral femoral condyle OCDs, 3 lateral meniscal tears [1 discoid], and 1 discoid meniscus). Only 2 lesions were visible on initial radiographs; all 9 were visible on magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent initial nonoperative treatment; 2 patients demonstrated resolution of symptoms. Two patients underwent surgery for concomitant pathology, and the OCD was not addressed surgically. A total of 5 patients continued to be symptomatic after nonoperative treatment, prompting surgical intervention, which consisted of microfracture and chondroplasty in all 5 cases. A total of 2 of the 5 microfracture patients had resolution of symptoms, while another 2 patients had continued symptoms ultimately responsive to steroid injection treatment. One patient had revision microfracture, followed by autologous chondrocyte implantation and an arthroscopic lysis of adhesions. At final follow-up, ranging from 7 months to 10 years, 8 patients were asymptomatic, while 1 patient had developed early osteoarthritis.OCD of the tibial plateau in young patients is rare, usually involves the lateral side, and may have significant long-term implications for knee function. Presenting symptoms are often vague, and lesions may not always be visible on initial radiographs, which may lead to delayed treatment and adversely affect outcomes.",0

However, whether the use of acellular spongy poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolding plus treadmill exercise as a rehabilitation program regenerates OC defects in a large-animal model has yet to be determined. Hypothesis: PLGA scaffolding plus treadmill exercise may offer improved OC repair for both high and low weightbearing regions in a minipig model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 9 mature minipigs (18 knees) were randomly divided into the treadmill exercise (TRE) group or sedentary (SED) group. All pigs received critically sized OC defects in a higher weightbearing region of the medial condyle and a lower weightbearing region of the trochlear groove. In each minipig, a PLGA scaffold was placed in the defect of the right knee (PLGA subgroup), and the defect of the left knee was untreated (empty defect [ED] subgroup). The TRE group performed exercises in 3 phases: warm-up, 3 km/h for 5 minutes; main exercise, 4 km/h for 20 minutes; and cool-down, 3 km/h for 5 minutes. The total duration was about 30 minutes whenever possible. The SED group was allowed free cage activity. Results: At 6 months, the TRE-PLGA group showed the highest gross morphology scores and regenerated a smooth articular surface covered with new hyaline-like tissue, while the defects of the other groups remained and contained nontransparent tissue. Histologically, the TRE-PLGA group also revealed sound OC integration, chondrocyte-like cells embedded in lacunae, abundant glycosaminoglycans, a sound collagen structure, and modest inflammatory cells with an inflammatory response (ie, tumor necrosis factor–α, interleukin-6). In addition, in the medial condyle region, the TRE-PLGA group (31.80 ± 3.03) had the highest total histological scores (TRE-ED: 20.20 ± 5.76; SED-PLGA: 10.25 ± 6.24; SED-ED: 11.75 ± 6.50; P = .004). In the trochlear groove region, the TRE-PLGA group (30.20 ± 6.42) displayed significantly higher total histological scores (TRE-ED: 19.60 ± 7.00; SED-PLGA: 10.00 ± 5.42; SED-ED: 11.25 ± 5.25; P = .006). In contrast, the SED-PLGA and SED-ED groups revealed an irregular surface with abrasion, fibrotic tissue with an empty void and inflammatory cells, disorganized collagen fibers, and less glycosaminoglycan deposition. Micro–computed tomography analysis revealed that the TRE-PLGA group had integrated OC interfaces with continued remodeling in the subchondral bone. Furthermore, comparing the 2 defect regions, no statistically significant differences in cartilage regeneration were detected, indicating the suitability of this regenerative approach for both high and low weightbearing regions. Conclusion: Implanting an acellular PLGA scaffold plus treadmill exercise promoted articular cartilage regeneration for both high and low weightbearing regions in minipigs. Clinical Relevance: This study suggests the use of a cell-free porous PLGA scaffold and treadmill exercise rehabilitation as an alternative therapeutic strategy for OC repair in a large-animal knee joint model. This combined effect may pave the way for biomaterials and exercise regimens in the application of OC repair.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465211008655,The Beneficial Effect of an Intra-articular Injection of Losartan on Microfracture-Mediated Cartilage Repair Is Dose Dependent,"Background: A previous publication demonstrated that the oral intake of losartan promoted microfracture-mediated hyaline-like cartilage repair in osteochondral defects of a rabbit knee model. However, an intra-articular (IA) injection of losartan may have direct beneficial effects on cartilage repair and has not been studied. Purpose: To determine the dosage and beneficial effects of an IA injection of losartan on microfracture-mediated cartilage repair and normal cartilage homeostasis. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Rabbits were divided into 5 groups (n = 6 each): a microfracture group (MFX group) and 4 different losartan treatment groups that received varying doses of IA losartan (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg per knee). An osteochondral defect (5 mm) was created in the trochlear groove cartilage of 1 limb in each rabbit, and 5 microfracture perforations were made in the osteochondral defect. Both the injured and the contralateral knee joints were injected with IA losartan immediately after microfracture and at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Rabbits were sacrificed at 6 weeks after surgery for analysis including gross observation, micro–computed tomography, histology, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Micro–computed tomography and gross observation demonstrated comparable subchondral bone healing and hyaline-like cartilage morphology in the 0.1-, 1-, and 10-mg losartan groups relative to the MFX group. Conversely, the 100-mg losartan group showed neither bony defect healing nor cartilage repair. Histology revealed higher O’Driscoll scores and hyaline-like cartilage regeneration in the 1-mg losartan group compared with the MFX group. In contrast, the 100-mg losartan group showed the lowest histology score and no cartilage repair. An IA injection of losartan at the doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg did not cause adverse effects on uninjured cartilage, while the 100-mg dose induced cartilage damage. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed downregulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway after IA losartan injection. Conclusion: An IA injection of losartan at the dose of 1 mg was most effective for the enhancement of microfracture-mediated cartilage repair without adversely affecting uninjured cartilage. Conversely, a high dose (100 mg) IA injection of losartan inhibited cartilage repair in the osteochondral defect and was chondrotoxic to normal articular cartilage. Clinical Relevance: An IA injection of losartan at an optimal dosage represents a novel microfracture enhancement therapy and warrants a clinical trial for future clinical applications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-017-4714-4,Focal metallic inlay resurfacing prosthesis for the treatment of localized cartilage defects of the femoral condyles: a systematic review of clinical studies,"Purpose To systematically review the results of focal metallic inlay resurfacing prosthesis for the treatment of isolated cartilage defects of the femoral condyles. Methods A systematic electronic search of the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library was performed in April 2017 to identify studies that reported clinical or radiographic outcome of focal metallic inlay resurfacing prosthesis for the treatment of isolated cartilage defects of the femoral condyles. Included studies were abstracted regarding study characteristics, patient demographics, prosthetic device and location, indications and contraindications, and outcome measures. Outcome of interest included functional outcome scores, radiographic measures, complications, re-operations, and conversion to arthroplasty. The methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed with the Coleman Methodology Score. Results Six studies with a total of 186 patients met the inclusion criteria. Five studies were level IV evidence, and one was level III. The methodologic quality of the included studies was good, with a mean Coleman Methodology Score of 78. Two different implants were used: the HemiCAP (R) (five studies; 66% of study group) and UniCAP (R) (one study; 34%) implant. The mean age was 46-54 years, and the mean follow-up was 24 months to 7 years. Pre- and post-operative outcome scores were compared in all six studies, and five studies reported significant improvements at the final follow-up for all scores (objective und functional KSS, KOOS, WOMAC, Tegner, HSS Knee and Function score, SF-36 and SF-12 physical component score) except for the SF-36 and SF-12 mental component score. Progression of osteoarthritis was analysed using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading in three studies (30% of study group), with two studies reporting significant progression. The OARSI grading system was analysed in one study with no significant progression. The overall conversion rate to arthroplasty was 22% with considerable differences between the two implants: 9% for HemiCAP (R) and 47% for UniCAP (R). Conclusions Focal metallic inlay resurfacing prosthesis seems to be a viable option for a carefully selected group of patients. Significant improvement in knee function and pain was observed in most patients. Uncertainty remains with regard to progression of osteoarthritis because of conflicting results and inconsistent reporting. One out of five patients has to be converted to arthroplasty after an average of 4 years. However, compared to the UniCAP (R) implant, considerable lower conversion rates were reported for the smaller HemiCAP (R) implant.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.d.02086,Chondrocyte Death Associated with Human Femoral Osteochondral Harvest as Performed for Mosaicplasty,"Autologous osteochondral transfer is an option for the treatment of articular defects. However, there are concerns about graft integration and the nature of the tissue forming the cartilage-cartilage bridge. Chondrocyte viability at graft and recipient edges is thought to be an important determinant of the quality of repair. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate early cell viability at the edges of osteochondral grafts from ex vivo human femoral condyles.Fresh human tissue was obtained from eleven knees at the time of total knee arthroplasty for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Osteochondral cylinders were harvested with use of a 4.5-mm-diameter mosaicplasty osteotome from regions of the anterolateral aspect of the femoral condyle that were macroscopically nondegenerate and histologically nonfibrillated. Plugs were assessed for marginal cell viability by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy.The diameter of the cartilaginous portion of the osteochondral plugs was a mean (and standard error of the mean) of 4.84 +/- 0.12 mm (as determined on the basis of three plugs). This value was approximately 300 microm greater than the measured internal diameter of the osteotome. There was a substantial margin of superficial zone cell death (mean thickness, 382 +/- 68.2 microm), with >99% cell viability seen more centrally (as determined on the basis of five plugs). Demiplugs were created by splitting the mosaicplasty explants with a fresh number-11 scalpel blade. The margin of superficial zone cell death at the curved edge was significantly greater than that at the site of the scalpel cut (390.3 +/- 18.8 microm compared with 34.8 +/- 3.2 microm; p = 0.0286). Similar findings were observed when the cartilage alone was breached and the bone was left intact, with the margin of superficial zone cell death being significantly greater than that obtained in association with the straight scalpel incision (268 +/- 38.9 microm compared with 41.3 +/- 13.4 microm; p = 0.0286). The margin of superficial zone cell death showed no increase during the time-period between fifteen minutes and two hours after plug harvest. A mathematical approximation of the mosaicplasty region suggested that early cell death of this magnitude affects about one third of the superficial graft area.The results of the present study suggest that mosaicplasty, while capable of transposing viable hyaline cartilage, is associated with an extensive margin of cell death that is likely to compromise lateral integration and articular reconstruction.",0

However, allografts and synthetic implants have major drawbacks such as the limited supply of grafts and lack of integration into host tissue, respectively. In this study, we investigated the effects of conditioned medium (CM) from meniscal fibrochondrocytes and TGF-β3 on tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) for meniscus tissue engineering. CM-expanded T-MSCs were encapsulated in riboflavin-induced photocrosslinked collagen-hyaluronic acid (COL-RF-HA) hydrogels and cultured in chondrogenic medium containing TGF-β3. In vitro results indicate that CM-expanded cells followed by TGF-β3 exposure stimulated the expression of fibrocartilage-related genes (COL2, SOX9, ACAN, COL1) and production of extracellular matrix components. Histological assessment of in vitro and subcutaneously implanted in vivo constructs demonstrated that CM-expanded cells followed by TGF-β3 exposure resulted in highest cell proliferation, GAG accumulation, and collagen deposition. Furthermore, when implanted into meniscus defect model, CM treatment amplified the potential of TGF-β3 and induced complete regeneration.Conditioned medium derived from chondrocytes have been reported to effectively prime mesenchymal stem cells toward chondrogenic lineage. Type I collagen is the main component of meniscus extracellular matrix and hyaluronic acid is known to promote meniscus regeneration. In this manuscript, we investigated the effects of conditioned medium (CM) and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) on tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) encapsulated in riboflavin-induced photocrosslinked collagen-hyaluronic acid (COL-RF-HA) hydrogel. We employed a novel source of conditioned medium, derived from meniscal fibrochondrocytes. Our in vitro and in vivo results collectively illustrate that CM-expanded cells followed by TGF-β3 exposure have the best potential for meniscus regeneration. This manuscript highlights a novel stem cell commitment strategy combined with biomaterials designs for meniscus regeneration.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967117753140,Fixation of Traumatic Chondral-Only Fragments of the Knee in Pediatric and Adolescent Athletes: A Retrospective Multicenter Report,"While traditional biological principles have suggested that fragments consisting of cartilage alone cannot be reaffixed to bone with expectable long-term healing, case reports of successful healing after fixation in younger patients indicate that this concept remains incompletely explored.To evaluate the presenting features, techniques, healing rates, and clinical and radiological results in a cohort of pediatric and adolescent athletes who underwent fixation of traumatic chondral-only fragments in the knee.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Patient registries at 2 tertiary care children's hospitals were reviewed to identify patients ≤18 years old who underwent fixation of a ""chondral-only"" fragment in the knee, defined as the inability to visualize the fragment on injury radiographs or discern bone on the articular portion of a fragment intraoperatively. The mechanism of injury, fragment features, fixation technique, and postoperative clinical course, including timing of sports clearance, healing on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and any complications or reoperations, were assessed.Fifteen patients with a median age at surgery of 12.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 11.7-14.2 years) and median follow-up of 12.0 months (IQR, 6.0-19.2 months) were analyzed. All patients sustained an acute knee injury before surgery. The injured sites, as assessed on MRI, were the patella (n = 6), trochlea (n = 5), and lateral femoral condyle (n = 4). The median fragment surface area was 492.0 mm2 (IQR, 400.0-787.5 mm2). Fixation with bioabsorbable implants was performed in all patients at a median of 1.6 weeks (IQR, 1.0-2.6 weeks) after the injury. One patient (7%) sustained a fall 8 weeks postoperatively, requiring secondary surgery for excision of a dislodged fragment, and 1 patient (7%) underwent unrelated patellar stabilization surgery 3.4 years postoperatively, at which time the fragment was found to be stable. MRI was performed in 9 of 14 patients with retained fragments (median, 12.0 months postoperatively), with 5 patients (56%) showing restoration of the cartilage contour and the resolution of subchondral edema; 2 patients showed thinning but intact cartilage, 1 had cartilage thickening, and 1 had subchondral edema, fissuring, and cystic changes. The median time to return to sports for all 15 patients was 26.0 weeks (IQR, 22.8-40.9 weeks), including 2 patients who required second surgery and returned to sports at 26.1 and 191.1 weeks.Fixation of traumatic chondral-only fragments using bioabsorbable implants may result in successful short-term healing in the majority of pediatric and adolescent athletes.",0
,Transplantation of deep frozen menisci,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Subtotal or total meniscectomy will increase weight-bearing per square unit of the cartilage surface approximately threeand- half-times. A long-term overloading of cartilage is clinically manifested by pain, swelling and a rapid onset of early arthritic lesions discernible on radiograms. One of the options for the treatment of degenerative changes in the joint is meniscal transplant. The authors present their first experience with the transplantation of deep frozen meniscal tissue in the Czech Republic. MATERIAL By September 2006, we had treated 26 patients with clinical problems following subtotal or total meniscectomy. The patients, 15 women and 11 men, were between 24 and 46 years of age. Eighteen patients underwent transplantation of the medial meniscus and eight received a lateral meniscal transplant. Concomitant repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was indicated in 11 patients, of whom 10 were treated with semitendinosus tendon graft and one with patellar ligament allograft. One patient with a lateral meniscal transplant and ACL reconstruction also had suture of the medial meniscus for a previously sustained injury. In 16 patients, chondromalacia was at the level of Outerbridge grade II and, only in five patients, the finding was Outerbridge grade I. Five patients with grade III chondromalacia were treated using the microfracture technique. Valgus or varus osteotomy was not indicated at all. METHODS The goal of meniscal transplant surgery is: 1) to relieve pain after meniscectomy; 2) to prevent degenerative changes of cartilage; 3) to eliminate or reduce the risk of development of osteoarthritic lesions; 4) to restore normal mechanics of the knee joint. Patient selection is important and it is necessary to take into consideration: 1) level of cartilage degenerative changes; 2) knee alignment; 3) knee joint stability; 4) graft size. In patients with instability of the knee and indications for meniscal graft, it is necessary to stabilize the joint by ligament reconstruciton prior to transplantation; in the case of malalignment corrective osteotomy is required. RESULTS All patients healed without complications. At the end of the third follow-up month, the range of motion was S-0-0-130 in 22 patients and S-0-0-120 in three patients. Only one patient had the range of motion restricted to S-0-0-110. Evaluation showed improvement from pre-operative values to those at 6 months and two years post-operatively as follows: IKDS score, 57-64 to 73-80 to 76-84; Lysholm score, 50-76 to 80-90 to 85-95; and Tegner score, 2-4 to 4-7 to 5-8. No complications associated with meniscal transplant incorporation were recorded. Also in five patients with Outbridge grade III degenerative changes, meniscal transplantation was successfully carried out. In four patients, of which two had a cartilage defect treated, second-look arthroscopy showed that the lesions healed with healthy fibrocartilaginous tissue. CONCLUSIONS All patients reported resolution of subjective complaints, as seen from the results of the IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scoring systems. It was obvious that when biomechanics of the knee joint were restored, conditions facilitating healing of chondral defects were provided. Based on this experience, the authors conclude that meniscal transplantation improves the quality of life in biologically young patients with clinical problems after meniscectomy.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546512469091,Arthroscopic Retrograde Osteochondral Autograft Transplantation for Cartilage Lesions of the Tibial Plateau,"Background: There are only 2 reported cases of arthroscopic retrograde osteochondral autograft transplantations regarding tibial plateau cartilage defects. Purpose: To present a detailed description of arthroscopic retrograde osteochondral autograft transplantation of the tibial plateau as well as to provide its advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other techniques. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Four patients (3 men and 1 woman; mean age, 31.2 years) suffering from tibial plateau cartilage lesions underwent surgery. In each case, the lesions were caused by sports injuries. There were 3 lateral and 1 medial tibial plateau defects. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. Radiological assessment was made by plain radiographs, CT arthroscans, and MRI. Results: The mean follow-up was 55 months (range, 52-60). The mean preoperative IKDC score was 53.5 (range, 37-66), while the mean postoperative IKDC score at final follow-up was 95.4 (range, 93.1-97.7). Regarding the KOOS calculation, there was significant improvement concerning each parameter after surgery. All patients were satisfied with the surgical procedure and returned to their previous activity level. Postoperative imaging showed very good adaptation and incorporation of the osteochondral autografts. Conclusion: Treatment of tibial plateau cartilage defects with arthroscopic retrograde osteochondral autograft transplantation could be performed on a routine basis in clinical practice. The results were encouraging and showed good incorporation of the graft, a minimal failure rate, and satisfactory functional outcomes of patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-019-1144-7,Effects of tranexamic acid on the recovery of osteochondral defects treated by microfracture and acellular matrix scaffold: an experimental study,"Microfracture and scaffold application in the treatment of osteochondral defects is still one of the most frequently used methods in the clinic. The most important step in this treatment method is the stabilization of fibrin clot. Tranexamic acid (TA) is an antifibrinolytic agent commonly used in orthopedic surgery in recent years. This study evaluated the effect of local TA application on healing of experimentally induced osteochondral defects on rabbits.This paper contains an animal in vivo data and histological outcomes on the effect of TA. Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were treated unilaterally and cylindrical defects having a width of 4 mm and depth of 5 mm were created in the weight-bearing surfaces of the medial and lateral condyles of the right femur. They were divided into two groups, as group 1 study and group 2 control groups, respectively. One milliliter (ml) of TA was injected into the knee joints of the subjects in group 1. All animals were sacrificed for the extraction of the femur condyles for histologic study at the fourth and eighth weeks after surgery. Histological evaluations were performed by Brittberg and O'Driscoll scores to all samples. Data were organized in a Standard Statistical Package System v.22 software package (SPSS/PC Inc., Chicago, IL.) and reported as mean and median (min-max). Repeated measures ANOVA test was used to compare groups and condyle effects together for each week. p values below 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.Samples were taken in the fourth and eighth weeks. The regularity of the surface in group 1 was smoother, and the tissue stability was more robust. Mean Brittberg scores in both weeks were statistically higher in group 1 when compared with group 2. In the microscopic evaluation, it was observed that the regeneration of subchondral and cartilage tissues were more rapid and organized in group 1, and the mean O' Driscoll scores in both weeks were statistically higher in group 1.Application of TA improves the healing time and tissue stability in osteochondral defects which are implanted a-cellular scaffold after microfracture and should be applicable to humans for the treatment of osteochondral defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2021.10.002,Surgical Treatment for Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT) are often associated with ankle pain and dysfunction. They can occur after ankle trauma, such as sprains or fractures, but they usually present as a continued ankle pain after the initial injury has resolved. Chronic ankle ligament instability and subsequent microtrauma may lead to insidious development of an OLT. Medial-sided lesions are more common (67%) than lateral-sided lesions. For acute lesions that are nondisplaced, nonoperative management is initially performed, with a 4-6 week period of immobilization and protected weight bearing. Symptomatic improvement results in more than 50% of patients by 3 months. Acute osteochondral talus fractures, which have a bone fragment thickness greater than 3 mm with displacement will benefit from early surgical intervention. These injuries should undergo primary repair via internal fixation with bioabsorbable compression screws 3.0 mm or smaller using at least 2 points of fixation. Acute lesions that are too small for fixation can be treated with morselization and reimplantation of the cartilage fragments. If OLTs are persistently symptomatic following an appropriate course of nonoperative treatment, various reparative and restorative surgical options may be considered on the basis of diameter, surface area, depth, and location of the lesion. A small subset of symptomatic osteochondral lesions of the talus involve subchondral pathology with intact overlying articular cartilage; in these cases, retrograde drilling into the cystic lesion can be employed to induce underlying bony healing. Cancellous bone graft augmentation may be used for subchondral cysts with volume greater than 100 mm3 or with those with a depth of more than 10 mm. Debridement, curettage, and bone marrow stimulation is a reparative technique that may be considered in lesions demonstrating a diameter less than 10 mm, with surface area less than 100 mm2, and a depth less than 5 mm. This technique is commonly performed arthroscopically using curettes and an arthroscopic shaver to remove surrounding unstable cartilage. A microfracture awl of 1 mm or less is used to puncture the subchondral bone with 3-4 mm of spacing between to induce punctate bleeding. Initial (<5 year) results are good to excellent in 80% of cases, with some deterioration of improvement over time. Factors contributing to poor results include surface area greater than 1.5 cm2, overall osteochondral lesion depth over 7.8 mm, smoking history, age over 40, and uncontained lesions. Lesions greater than 1.29 cm2, cystic lesions, and lesions that have failed prior treatment are potential candidates for osteochondral autograft transplantation. The autograft is typically harvested from the lateral femoral condyle of the ipsilateral knee with an optimal plug depth and diameter of 12-15 mm. Transplantation often involves open technique and may even require malleolar osteotomy for perpendicular access to the defect, as well as visualization of a flush, congruent graft fit. Good to excellent outcomes have been reported in up 87.4% of cases with the most common complication being donor site morbidity in up to 15% of cases. Failure rates increased significantly in lesions larger than 225 mm2. Scaffold-based therapies, such as matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation, can be employed in primary or revision settings in lesions larger than 1 cm2, including uncontained shoulder lesions with or without cysts. Lesions with greater than 4 mm of bone loss following debridement may require bone grafting to augment with the scaffold. This technique requires an initial procedure for chondrocyte harvest and a secondary procedure for transplantation of the scaffold. Outcomes have been good to excellent in up to 93% of cases; however, this technique requires a two-stage procedure and can be cost-prohibitive. Particulated juvenile cartilage is a restorative technique that employs cartilage allograft from juvenile donors. The cartilage is placed into the defect and secured with fibrin glue in a single-stage procedure. Studies have shown favorable outcomes in 92% of cases, with lesions between 10 and 15 mm in diameter, but increased failure rates and poorer outcomes in lesions larger than 15 mm. This may be an alternative option for contained lesions between 10 and 15 mm in diameter. Osteochondral allograft plugs are an option for larger contained lesions (>1.5 cm in diameter) and in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and concern for donor site morbidity. Furthermore, bulk osteochondral allograft from a size-matched talus can also be used for even larger, unstable/uncontained shoulder lesions. An anterior approach is often employed and fixation is achieved via placement of countersunk headless compression screws. Failure of the aforementioned options associated with persistent pain or progressive OA would then lend consideration to ankle arthroplasty versus ankle arthrodesis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-012-2523-0,Can Fresh Osteochondral Allografts Restore Function in Juveniles With Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Knee?,"Failure of initial treatment for juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) may require further surgical intervention, including microfracture, autograft chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autografting, and fresh osteochondral allografting. Although allografts and autografts will restore function in most adults, it is unclear whether fresh osteochondral allograft transplantations similarly restore function in skeletally immature patients who failed conventional treatment.Therefore, we determined function in (1) daily activity; (2) sports participation; and (3) healing (by imaging) in children with juvenile OCD who failed conventional therapy and underwent fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation.We retrospectively reviewed 11 children with OCD of the knee treated with a fresh stored osteochondral allograft between 2004 and 2009 (six males and five females). The average age of the children at the time of their allograft surgery was 15.2 years (range, 13-20 years). The clinical assessments included physical examination, radiography, MRI, and a modified Merle D'Aubigné-Postel score. The size of the allograft was an average of 5.11 cm(2). The minimum followup was 12 months (average, 24 months; range, 12-41 months).All patients had returned to activities of daily living without difficulties at 6 months and returned to full sports activities between 9 and 12 months after surgery. The modified Merle D'Aubigné-Postel score improved from an average of 12.7 preoperatively to 16.3 at 24 months postoperatively. Followup radiographs at 2 years showed full graft incorporation and no demarcation between the host and graft bone.Our observations suggested fresh osteochondral allografts restored short-term function in patients with juvenile OCD who failed standard treatments.Level IV, case series.

The inability of cartilage tissue to self-repair is instrumental in developing tissue engineered substitutes. To this effect, the present study aims to engineer cartilage construct by culturing umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on novel 3D porous scaffolds developed from natural biopolymers, silk fibroin (SF) and chitosan (CS), with addition of cartilage matrix components, glucosamine (Gl) and chondroitin sulfate (Ch). The presence of Gl and Ch is expected to enhance cartilage regeneration. The developed SF/CS-Gl-Ch scaffolds possess desired pore size in the range 56.55-168.15 μm, 88-92% porosity, 44.7-46.8̊ contact angle, controlled swelling and biodegradability. Upon culturing under dynamic condition in a spinner flask bioreactor, the scaffold supported hMSCs attachment, proliferation, and further promoted chondrogenic differentiation. Cartilage-specific matrix and gene (Collagen II, Sox9 and aggrecan) expression analyses by histology, immunophenotype, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR studies showed superiority of cell-scaffold construct generated in dynamic culture towards cartilage tissue generation as compared to cell aggregates formed by pellet culture. This study demonstrates the potentiality of SF/CS-Gl-Ch porous scaffold for the development of tissue construct for cartilage regeneration under dynamic culture condition.",0

Patients were enrolled between June 2012 and September 2016. The primary endpoint of the study was the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 52 weeks after implantation. The IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were evaluated at the time of screening and at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks after implantation. Improvements from the baseline scores were evaluated using the equation ""(postoperative score) - (preoperative score)."" Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 2, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after implantation, and MRI measurements were evaluated using T1 rho and T2 mapping.Nine patients were enrolled in this study and were examined for safety. Product quality did not satisfy the specification in one patient, and bacterial joint infection occurred in one patient. As a result, seven patients were included in the outcome analyses. The mean IKDC score significantly improved from 36.4 preoperatively to 74.1% at 52 weeks after implantation (p < 0.0001). The mean Lysholm and VAS scores also significantly improved from 39.6 to 57.4 to 89.6 and 22.9, respectively, after surgery. In the MRI evaluation, the T1 rho and T2 values of the implanted area were similar to those of the surrounding cartilage at 52 weeks after implantation.Third generation ACI (IK-01) can be an effective treatment option for focal cartilage defects of the knee; however, surgeons must pay careful attention to the risk of postoperative joint infection.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2018.09.058,Mechanically stimulated osteochondral organ culture for evaluation of biomaterials in cartilage repair studies,"Surgical procedures such as microfracture or autologous chondrocyte implantation have been used to treat articular cartilage lesions; however, repair often fails in terms of matrix organization and mechanical behaviour. Advanced biomaterials and tissue engineered constructs have been developed to improve cartilage repair; nevertheless, their clinical translation has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vitro models suitable for pre-clinical screening of new implants and compounds. In this study, an osteochondral defect model in a bioreactor that mimics the multi-axial motion of an articulating joint, was developed. Osteochondral explants were obtained from bovine stifle joints, and cartilage defects of 4 mm diameter were created. The explants were used as an interface against a ceramic ball applying dynamic compressive and shear loading. Osteochondral defects were filled with chondrocytes-seeded fibrin-polyurethane constructs and subjected to mechanical stimulation. Cartilage viability, proteoglycan accumulation and gene expression of seeded chondrocytes were compared to free swelling controls. Cells within both cartilage and bone remained viable throughout the 10-day culture period. Loading did not wear the cartilage, as indicated by histological evaluation and glycosaminoglycan release. The gene expression of seeded chondrocytes indicated a chondrogenic response to the mechanical stimulation. Proteoglycan 4 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein were markedly increased, while mRNA ratios of collagen type II to type I and aggrecan to versican were also enhanced. This mechanically stimulated osteochondral defect culture model provides a viable microenvironment and will be a useful pre-clinical tool to screen new biomaterials and biological regenerative therapies under relevant complex mechanical stimuli. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Articular cartilage lesions have a poor healing capacity and reflect one of the most challenging problems in orthopedic clinical practice. The aim of current research is to develop a testing system to assess biomaterials for implants, that can permanently replace damaged cartilage with the original hyaline structure and can withstand the mechanical forces long term. Here, we present an osteochondral ex vivo culture model within a cartilage bioreactor, which mimics the complex motion of an articulating joint in vivo. The implementation of mechanical forces is essential for pre-clinical testing of novel technologies in the field of cartilage repair, biomaterial engineering and regenerative medicine. Our model provides a unique opportunity to investigate healing of articular cartilage defects in a physiological joint-like environment.",0

Although there have been many attempts to treat articular cartilage defects, such as drilling, microfracture techniques, soft tissue grafts or osteochondral grafts, no treatment has managed to repair the defects with long-lasting hyaline cartilage. Recently, a regenerative medicine using a tissue engineering technique for cartilage repair has been given much attention in the orthopedic field. In 1994, Brittberg et al. introduced a new cell technology in which chondrocytes expanded in monolayer culture were transplanted into the cartilage defect of the knee. As a second generation of chondrocyte transplantation, since 1996 we have been performing transplantation of tissue-engineered cartilage made ex vivo for the treatment of osteochondral defects of the joints. This signifies a concept shift from cell transplantation to tissue transplantation made ex vivo using tissue engineering techniques. We have reported good clinical results with this surgical treatment. However, extensive basic research is vital to achieve better clinical results with this tissue engineering technique. This article describes our recent research using a minimally invasive tissue engineering technique to promote cartilage regeneration.",0

This prospective study was performed to determine the results after ACI at different time intervals over a period of 36 months.Between 2000 and 2002, 63 patients (mean age, 34 years) with full-thickness chondral lesions of the knee underwent an autologous chondrocyte implantation and were evaluated preoperatively and at 6, 18, and 36 months after surgery. The chondrocyte suspension within the defect was covered with a type I/III collagen membrane. Depending on the localization of the defects (femoral condyles, trochlea, and retropatellar), the patients were assigned to three different groups. Exclusion criteria were meniscal pathologies, axial malpositioning, and ligament instabilities. Baseline clinical scores (modified Cincinnati knee score and the International Cartilage Repair Society score) were determined and compared with follow-up data by using the paired Wilcoxon test.The ICRS and modified Cincinnati score showed significant improvement (P < .01) in all time intervals between preoperative and 6, 18, and 36 months after surgery. There was no significant difference in the final outcome between different defect localizations (P > .2). The Pearson coefficient of correlation between clinical and MRI scores was 0.73 and significant at the 0.01 level. There was no patient with a symptomatic graft hypertrophy.ACI is an effective method in the treatment of isolated cartilage defects in the knee. Graft hypertrophy can be avoided by using a collagen membrane. Significant improvement (P < .001) occurs still between 18 and 36 months after surgery.Level IV, therapeutic case series.",0

In the knee joint of miniature pigs, cartilage lesions were treated by microfracturing and were then either left empty, covered with a collagen membrane, or treated by matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation. In control lesions, the subchondral bone plate was left intact (partial-thickness lesion). The repair tissues were analyzed after 12 weeks by histological methods focusing on bone formation and vascularization. The effect of chondrocytes on angiogenesis was assessed by in vitro assays. The presence of antiangiogenic proteins in cartilage repair tissue, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and chondromodulin-I (ChM-I), was detected immunohistochemically and their expression in chondrocytes and bone marrow stromal cells was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Significant outgrowths of subchondral bone and excessive endochondral ossification within the repair tissue were regularly observed in lesions with an exposed or microfractured subchondral bone plate. In contrast, such excessive bone formation was significantly inhibited by the additional transplantation of chondrocytes. Cartilaginous repair tissue that resisted ossification was strongly positive for the antiangiogenic proteins, TSP-1 and ChM-I, which were, however, not detectable in vascularized osseous outgrowths. Chondrocytes were identified to be the major source of TSP-1- and ChM-I expression and were shown to counteract the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. These data suggest that the resistance of cartilaginous repair tissue against endochondral ossification following the transplantation of chondrocytes is associated with the presence of antiangiogenic proteins whose individual relevance has yet to be further explored.",0

Materials &amp; methods: Human subchondral mesenchymal progenitor cells were analyzed for their migration capacity upon treatment with human plasma-derived FN. Proliferation activity was evaluated by DNA content. For chondrogenesis, cells were cultured in high-density pellet cultures in the presence of FN, TGFβ3, and a combination thereof. Results: Treatment of progenitors with FN significantly increased the number of migrating cells and elevated proliferative activity. Histological staining indicated formation of an extracellular matrix with type II collagen. Gene expression analysis gave no evidence for chondrogenic differentiation mediated by FN, but revealed a significant induction of type II collagen expression. Conclusion: FN has a potential to recruit human subchondral mesenchymal progenitor cells, possibly supporting proliferation and matrix assembly in cartilage repair procedures using bioactive implants after microfracture treatment.",0

Five consecutive patients after microfracturing and defect coverage with the chondrotissue(A (R)) implant immersed with autologous serum were included. After a mean follow-up of 21 months (range 11-31 months), defect fill and repair tissue quality was assessed by 3-T MRI followed by applying established MRI scoring systems. The patients' situation was assessed using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and a patients' satisfaction questionnaire. Magnetic resonance imaging showed good to excellent defect fill with complete integration. The mean MOCART score was 61 (range 50-75) points. The mean Henderson score was 7 (range 6-9) points. All patients showed subchondral bone alterations. The KOOS showed good values in all sub-categories in 4 out of 5 patients and a mean overall score of 73 (range 40-90) points. Two patients rated the outcome as excellent, two as good and one as fair. All patients would have the procedure again and recommend it. In this small case series, the coverage of symptomatic retropatellar cartilage defects with the chondrotissue(A (R)) implant after microfracturing was safe and feasible with improvement of the patients' situation at short-term follow-up.

Graphene oxide with 0.3, 0.5, and 1 wt% was added to different concentrations of PCL solutions under sonication. The blends were electrospun under varied conditions of 10-20 kV applied voltages, a distance of 10 to 20 cm, and a 0.5 ml/hr flow rate. The web of PCL(10 %)-GO(0.5 %) was selected as an optimum one via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which exhibited uniform morphology with a 257 +/- 18 nm average diameter. The fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results showed that the specified peaks of both PCL and GO in the blends. Mechanical investigation exhibited higher strength of the PCL-GO web (about 4.3 MPa) compare to the PCL web. The porosity of the webs was measured by densitometry, which showed an increase in porosity from 80 % to 92 % after the bulking process (ultra-sonication, followed by freeze-drying). The MTT assay was employed using human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) on the scaffolds. Results indicated that the cell viability of bulk and non-bulk PCL-GO scaffolds were about 98 % and 99.8 %, respectively. In vivo study was carried out on defected cartilage knees of fourteen New Zealand rabbits. For monitoring the cartilage repair, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as pathological investigations were performed after surgery. The results of MRI and H&E staining showed high qualified healing of defects, which were exposed to bulk nanofibrous scaffold. Therefore, bulk PCL-GO electrospun scaffolds can be introduced as a suitable scaffolds for cartilage regeneration.",0

Twenty-three patients who received intra-articular CBMA injection in combination with polyurethane-based medial meniscus scaffold implantation were evaluated within the scope of this study. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to evaluate the results, and the visual analog scale was used to assess the pain scores. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in the preoperative period and at postoperative months 1, 12, 24, and 36 to assess the scaffold position as well as chondral degeneration/damage in a comparative manner. MRI assessment was performed by using the modified Outerbridge scale for cartilage and the Genovese scoring system for the meniscal implant. Twenty-three patients who were included in the study were evaluated for a mean follow-up period of 38.3 months. Patients exhibited statistically significant improvement according to all scoring data from the preoperative period until the follow-up period. The mean postoperative extrusion at year 3 was 2.39 mm (distribution 2.30–2.56 mm). There was no significant difference in the distribution of the degree of chondral damage between the preoperative and 3-year follow-up periods. Four patients did not show any improvement nor had lower scores according to the assessment. Medial meniscus scaffold implantation combined with intra-articular CBMA injection resulted in a significant improvement in all functions and pain scores as well as a statistically significant clinical improvement in IKDC and KOOS values in the short-term follow-up.

Interest has recently focused on fresh osteochondral allografts as a promising treatment alternative. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of osteochondral lesions of the talus treated with a fresh osteochondral allograft.We performed a transfer of fresh osteochondral allograft in forty-two patients with a symptomatic, refractory osteochondral lesion of the talus. Complete postoperative follow-up was achieved for thirty-eight patients with an average age of 44.2 years. Clinical evaluation was performed with use of the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score and a visual analog pain scale. All scores were obtained from either a retrospective chart review or a direct patient interview. All patients were also asked about their subjective satisfaction with the procedure. Magnetic resonance images were acquired for fifteen patients, to assess graft incorporation, subsidence, articular cartilage congruity, osteoarthritis, and stability with use of the De Smet criteria.The average duration of follow-up after osteochondral allograft transplantation was 37.7 months. Graft failure occurred in four patients. With the inclusion of scores before revision for those with graft failure, the mean visual analog pain scale score improved from 8.2 to 3.3 points, and the mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score improved from 52 to 79 points. Patient satisfaction with the outcome was rated as excellent, very good, or good by twenty-eight of the thirty-eight patients and as fair or poor by ten patients. Of the fifteen magnetic resonance imaging scans, most showed minimal graft subsidence, reasonable graft stability, and persistent articular congruence.In our experience, transplantation of fresh osteochondral allograft is a viable and effective method for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus as evidenced by improvements in pain and function.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-021-06763-w,Intra-articular steroid injection at the time of knee arthroscopy increases risk of post-operative infection,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk of post-operative infection after intra-articular steroid injection at the time of knee arthroscopy at a single institution high-volume sports medicine practice. METHODS: The electronic medical record at a single institution was queried for all patients who underwent knee arthroscopy from 2011 to 2019. Patients were included if they underwent more simple arthroscopic procedures: diagnostic arthroscopy, meniscectomy, loose body removal, synovectomy, or microfracture. Patients were excluded if they underwent more complex procedures, such as ligament reconstruction, meniscus repair, or any open procedures. These patients' medical records were then queried for current procedural terminology and international classification of disease codes indicating post-operative infection. Individual chart review was performed on this group of patients to determine if a true postoperative infection occurred within 6 months of the index arthroscopy. Patients were then categorized into ""intra-operative steroid injection"" versus ""no steroid"" based on each surgeon's preferred intra-operative analgesic injection cocktail. RESULTS: A total of 6889 patients were identified, including 2416 (35.1%) who were given intra-articular steroid at the time of knee arthroscopy. Post-operative infection occurred in 10 patients (0.15%) at a median of 18 days (range 9-42 days), 7 who received intra-operative steroid injection (0.29%) and 3 who did not (0.067%), p = 0.040. The relative risk of infection for those who received intra-operative steroid injection was 4.32 times higher than those who did not, with a number needed to harm of 448. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, smoking status, or the prevalence of diabetes between those who got infected and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Knee infection following arthroscopic surgery is rare. Intra-operative steroid injection during arthroscopic knee surgery is associated with a 4.3-fold increased risk of subsequent knee infection. While the overall risk remains low, the use of intra-operative steroids is expected to result in one additional knee infection for every 448 arthroscopic procedures performed.

Clinical data were recorded 2 to 12 years from surgery, with 20 of 145 patients lost to follow-up over 12 years (13.7%). Clinical outcomes were captured annually with validated Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner subjective questionnaires. Regenerated cartilage biopsy specimens were obtained at second-look arthroscopy from 66 patients and evaluated as to quality and quantity of defect fill by a blinded, independent histopathology reviewer.Preoperative versus postoperative validated pain, functioning, and activity measures improved significantly (P< .001). Clinically, 18 of the 125 patients were considered failures (14.4%), with 10 patients undergoing subsequent joint arthroplasty and 8 who reported worse pain after surgery. Regional histologic variation occurred. Forty-two of 66 biopsy specimens (63.6%) showed strong and consistent evidence of replacement of their articular surface, and 18 of 66 biopsy specimens (27.3%) showed development of areas of cartilage.Paste grafting is a low-cost, 1-stage arthroscopic treatment for patients with Outerbridge classification grade IV arthritic chondral lesions. The procedure offers excellent, long-lasting, pain relief, restored functioning, and possibility of tissue regeneration for patients with painful chondral lesions in both arthritic and traumatically injured knees.Level IV, case series.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1635110,Trends in Knee Articular Cartilage Treatments: An American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Database Study,"Abstract This study aims to evaluate the trends in treatment of knee articular cartilage lesions over the past decade using data obtained from the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part II database. The ABOS Part II database was queried from 2004 to 2013 for chondroplasty, microfracture, and osteochondral grafting procedures. All cases were analyzed for patient age and operating surgeon's fellowship training status. Univariate analysis including chi-square test for categorical variables and Student's t-test for continuous variables was performed to determine if any significant changes in practice patterns were present. Linear regression analyses were utilized to examine temporal trends in procedures performed and fellowship training status. From 2004 to 2013, 25,938 procedures addressing articular cartilage lesions from 3,586 surgeons were identified in the ABOS database. 46.8% of these orthopaedic surgeons had completed a 1-year sports medicine fellowship. Sixty-six percent of cartilage surgeries were performed by sports medicine-trained surgeons. The articular cartilage surgical volume decreased from 3,126 cases in 2004 to 1,690 cases in 2013. The most common procedure coded overall was chondroplasty (80.23%) followed by microfracture (21.37%) and osteochondral grafting (2.1%). The mean age of patients undergoing chondroplasty was 46.9 years; this was significantly higher than microfracture (mean age 40.5 years) or osteochondral grafting procedures (mean age 31.6 years), p &lt; 0.0005. The age of all patients undergoing cartilage surgery significantly decreased between 2004 and 2013, p &lt; 0.001. A dramatic decrease in reported chondroplasty volume was observed between 2011 and 2012. Concurrent osteotomies were used in &lt;1% of procedures addressing cartilage injuries, while 65% of patients underwent concurrent meniscectomy. These described trends are most pronounced in surgeons with sports medicine fellowship training. In conclusion, knee articular cartilage surgical volume and patient age have both sharply declined since 2011, a trend driven by sports medicine-trained Part II examinees. This trend correlates with changes in billing and coding practices, as well as improved education from high-level studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-013,Treatment of osteoarthritis with collagen-based scaffold: A porcine animal model with xenograft mesenchymal stem cells.,"With the goal to explore a new approach to treat the early degenerative lesions of hyaline cartilage, we implanted in a porcine OA model a collagen-based scaffold containing chondroprogenitor cells derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs).Porcine knee joints were subjected to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection to surgically induce OA. After 4 months, the time necessary for the development of cartilage surface damage, animals were treated either with trephination bone plug wrapped with the chondroprogenic hBM-MSCs-embedded collagen scaffold or microfractures alone. Histological and histomorphometric evaluations were performed at 5 months after surgery.All animals subjected to ACL transection showed osteoarthritic changes including mild lateral femoral condyle or moderate medial femoral condyle ulcerations. After 14 days' chondrogenic induction, hBM-MSCs seeded onto the scaffold showed expression of chondroprogenitor markers such as SOX9 and COMP. At 5 months after the implantation, significant differences in the quality of the regenerated tissue were found between the hBM-MSCs-embedded scaffold group and the control group. Newly generated tissue was only observed at the site of implantation with the hBM-MSCs-embedded scaffolds. Furthermore, histological examination of the generated tissue revealed evidence of cartilage-like tissue with lacuna formation. In contrast, fibrous layers or fissures were formed on the surface of the control knee joint.This study shows that xenogenic hBM-MSC derived chondroprogenitor scaffolds can generate new cartilage tissue in porcine articular cartilage and have the potential as a useful treatment option for osteoarthritis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.34144,Augmenting the articular cartilage-implant interface: Functionalizing with a collagen adhesion protein,"The lack of integration between implants and articular cartilage is an unsolved problem that negatively impacts the development of treatments for focal cartilage defects. Many approaches attempt to increase the number of matrix-producing cells that can migrate to the interface, which may help to reinforce the boundary over time but does not address the problems associated with an initially unstable interface. The objective of this study was to develop a bioadhesive implant to create an immediate bond with the extracellular matrix components of articular cartilage. We hypothesized that implant-bound collagen adhesion protein (CNA) would increase the interfacial strength between a poly(vinly alcohol) implant and an articular cartilage immediately after implantation, without preventing cell migration into the implant. By way of a series of in vitro immunohistochemical and mechanical experiments, we demonstrated that (i) free CNA can bind to articular cartilage, (ii) implant-bound CNA can bind to collagen type II and (iii) implants functionalized with CNA result in a fourfold increase in interfacial strength with cartilage relative to untreated implants at day zero. Of note, the interfacial strength significantly decreased after 21 days in culture, which may be an indication that the protein itself has lost its effectiveness. Our data suggest that functionalizing scaffolds with CNA may be a viable approach toward creating an initially stable interface between scaffolds and articular cartilage. Further efforts are required to ensure long-term interface stability.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-020-03292-4,Effects of focal metallic implants on opposing cartilage – an in-vitro study with an abrasion test machine,"Abstract Background For focal cartilage defects, biological repair might be ineffective in patients over 45 years. A focal metallic implant (FMI) (Hemi-CAP Arthrosurface Inc., Franklin, MA, USA) was designed to reduce symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a FMI on the opposing tibial cartilage in a biomechanical set-up. It is hypothesized that a FMI would not damage the opposing cartilage under physiological loading conditions. Methods An abrasion machine was used to test the effects of cyclic loading on osteochondral plugs. The machine applied a compressive load of 33 N and sheared the samples 10 mm in the anteroposterior direction by 1 Hz. Tibial osteochondral plugs from porcine knees were placed in opposition to a FMI and cycled for 1 or 6 h. After testing each plug was fixed, stained and evaluated for cartilage damage. Results After 1 h of loading ( n = 6), none of the osteochondral plugs showed histologic signs of degradation. After 6 h of loading (n = 6) three samples had histologic signs of injury in the tangential zone (grade 1) and one had signs of injury in the transitional and deep zones (grade 2). Exploration for 6 h resulted in significant more cartilage damage compared to the shorter exploration time ( p = 0.06). However, no significant difference between saline and hyaluronic acid was evident ( p = 0.55 ). Conclusion Under physiologic loading conditions, contact with a FMI leads to cartilage damage in the opposing articular cartilage in six hours. In clinical practice, a thorough analysis of pre-existing defects on the opposing cartilage is recommended when FMI is considered.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/157488812799219009,"Current Clinical Therapies for Cartilage Repair, their Limitation and the Role of Stem Cells","The management of osteochondral defects of articular cartilage, whether from trauma or degenerative disease, continues to be a significant challenge for Orthopaedic surgeons. Current treatment options such as abrasion arthroplasty procedures, osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation fail to produce repair tissue exhibiting the same mechanical and functional properties of native articular cartilage. This results in repair tissue that inevitably fails as it is unable to deal with the mechanical demands of articular cartilage, and does not prevent further degeneration of the native cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cells have been proposed as a potential source of cells for cell-based cartilage repair due to their ability to self-renew and undergo multi-lineage differentiation. This proposed procedure has the advantage of not requiring harvesting of cells from the joint surface, and its associated donor site morbidity, as well as having multiple possible adult donor tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue and synovium. Mesenchymal stem cells have multi-lineage potential, but can be stimulated to undergo chondrogenesis in the appropriate culture medium. As the majority of work with mesenchymal stem cell-derived articular cartilage repair has been carried out in vitro and in animal studies, more work still has to be done before this technique can be used for clinical purposes. This includes realizing the ideal method of harvesting mesenchymal stem cells, the culture medium to stimulate proliferation and differentiation, appropriate choice of scaffold incorporating growth factors directly or with gene therapy and integration of repair tissue with native tissue.",0
,Predictors of Functional Outcome After Microfracture Treatment of Cartilage Defects of the Knee.,"INTRODUCTION Microfracture (MFx) is a widely used technique in the treatment of articular cartilage defects of the knee. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic factors of functional outcomes after MFx treatment of knee cartilage defects ≤ 4 cm2. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-eight patients who were to be treated by MFx for knee cartilage defects ≤ 4 cm2 were prospectively included. The mean follow-up was 5.7 years (3.7-9.5). Demographics, sport practiced, time from diagnosis to surgery and associated lesions were collected. The cartilage defect was graded according to the ICRS classification. The MOCART score was calculated from a one-year MRI. The subjective VAS and IKDC scores were collected preoperatively and at the latest follow-up. Prognostic factors were determined using univariate and multivariate regression analyses incorporating pre-, peri- and postoperative clinical and radiological criteria. The dependent variable was defined as the difference between the pre- and post-operative clinical scores (dIKDC and dVAS). RESULTS The mean size of the cartilage defect was 1.8 cm2 (0.8-4). At the last follow-up, the VAS and IKDC scores were significantly improved compared to the pre-operative period (p<0.01). The average MOCART score on the one-year MRI was 50 (20-70). Three patients (6 %) who demonstrated filling defects on MRI and debilitating pain required surgical re-intervention. The factors that impacted the functional outcome as reflected by the VAS and IKDC scores were age, BMI, time from diagnosis to surgery, size of the lesion and the MOCART score. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that MFx is a successful first-line treatment option for small articular cartilage defects (≤ 4 cm2) of the knee and provides good function and pain relief in the mid-term. The predictors of poor functional outcomes were older age, higher BMI, longer time from diagnosis to surgery, larger lesion size and lower MOCART score.",0

Here, critical-sized, chondral-only focal defects were created in sheep and treated with clinical-grade, co-polymeric poly-lactide:polyglycolic acid scaffolds either alone or seeded with 3.3 x 10(6) +/- A 0.4 x 10(6) autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells and studied over 12 month follow-up. An untreated group was included for comparison. Second-look arthroscopy performed at 4 months post-treatment evidenced the generation of neocartilage of better quality in those defects treated with cells. However, macroscopic scores in the cell-treated group declined significantly from 7.5 +/- A 2.3 at 4 months to 3.1 +/- A 2.6 (p = 0.0098) at 12 months post-treatment, whereas the other two experimental groups remained unaltered during 4-12 month post-treatment. The effectiveness of the cell-based approach proposed in this study is thus restricted to between months 1 and 4 post-treatment.",0

The autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of each participant were isolated, amplified, and then differentiated into CPs in atelocollagen. Neotissues made of CPs were implanted into cartilage defects with an average cell density of 4.9 ± 2.1 × 106 cells/cm2 through arthrotomy. The knee function was evaluated with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form. Patients’ knee functions significantly improved by the 28th week (IKDC score = 68.3 ± 12.1), relative to the initial functionality before the CP therapy (IKDC score = 46.1 ± 16.4, p-value = 0.0014). Nine of these twelve patients maintained good knee functions for 9 years post-implantation (IKDC score = 69.8 ± 12.3) at levels higher than the pre-implantation values (p-value = 0.0018). Patients were evaluated with MRI and arthroscopy, and the defective sites exhibited a smooth surface without a gap between the implant and host tissue. This study demonstrates that autologous CPs successfully engraft into the host tissue and result in the re-formation of hyaline-like cartilage, thereby improving the impaired knee functions. Most importantly, no adverse event was reported during this long-term follow-up period.",0

Without access to progenitor cells and the supply of blood and nutrients, the impaired articular cartilage would be short of the capability to self-repair. Although the present clinical treatments, including autogenous and allograft osteochondral transplantation, microfracture technique, and so forth, have shown some efficacies, their drawbacks, such as donor insufficiency and poor-integration with adjacent tissue, limit the satisfactory repair of articular cartilage defects and cause unsatisfied prognosis. Cartilage tissue engineering, involving the combination of progenitor cells with scaffolds, which serve as artificial extracellular matrices (ECMs), provides a promising strategy for cartilage regeneration. Recently, thermosensitive hydrogels have attracted much attention as scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering owing to their unique physical properties analogous to the native ECM. In this review, we summarize the fabrication, characterization of newly reported thermosensitive hydrogels as cartilage tissue engineering scaffolds. The potential challenges and future perspectives are proposed.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2018.09.55,The effectiveness of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells therapy for knee osteoarthritis in pigs,"Intraarticular injection of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has shown to be successful for treating osteoarthritis (OA). Nevertheless, many studies have been focusing on autologous MSCs. The following study investigates the safety and effectiveness of intraarticular injection of allogenic MSCs in a pig OA model.Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles were labelled with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to allow cells tracking using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A pig OA model was established by bilateral medial meniscectomy. Next, SPIO-BM-MSCs were injected into the right knee, while the left knee was left untreated. MRI and radiography were used to assess the degree of OA and to evaluate the effectiveness of allogenic MSCs. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), safranin-o fast green staining, toluidine blue, and immunohistochemical staining were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the injections.At concentration of ≤20 µg/mL, SPIO caused no toxicity to BM-MSCs. Four weeks after surgery, OA changes were observed on MRI scan. The SPIO labeled BM-MSCs were found moving towards the impaired part of the cartilage 8 to 24 h after injections. In addition, no significant differences between the right side (therapeutic side) and the left side (untreated side) were observed following histological and immunohistochemistry analysis.The suitable concentration of SPIO for labelling BMSCs was 20 µg/mL, while the allogenic MSCs could move towards and accumulate around the impaired cartilage. No significant difference was found between treatment and control group.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546517715725,Effects of Autogenous Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate on Radiographic Integration of Femoral Condylar Osteochondral Allografts,"Background: Transplantation of fresh osteochondral allografts (OCAs) is an attractive treatment option for symptomatic articular cartilage lesions in young, healthy patients. Because the lack of OCA bone integration can be a cause of treatment failure, methods for speeding and enhancing OCA bone integration to mitigate this potential complication are highly desirable. Purpose: To determine if autogenous bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) treatment of large femoral condylar OCAs would be associated with superior radiographic OCA bone integration compared with nontreated allografts during the critical first 6 months after surgery. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A review of patients enrolled in a prospective registry who were treated with transplantation of large OCAs to one or both femoral condyles at our institution from March 12, 2013 to March 14, 2016 was performed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on BMC treatment versus no BMC treatment; the treatment was nonrandomized and was rooted in a shift in practice and a continuing effort to optimize OCA transplantation at our institution. Patients were excluded if they did not have orthogonal view radiographs performed at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Each condyle undergoing OCA transplantation was assessed individually by an independent musculoskeletal radiologist, who was blinded to the treatment group and time point. OCAs were assessed with respect to graft integration (0%-100%; 0 = no integration, 100 = complete integration) and degree of sclerosis (0-3; 0 = normal, 1 = mild sclerosis, 2 = moderate sclerosis, and 3 = severe sclerosis) of the graft at each time point. Results: This study identified 17 condyles in 15 patients who underwent OCA transplantation without BMC and 29 condyles in 22 patients who underwent OCA transplantation with BMC. The BMC group had significantly ( P = .033) higher graft integration scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Graft sclerosis was significantly ( P = .017) less in the BMC group at 6 weeks and 3 months, with no significant difference at 6 months after surgery. When combining the groups to examine the influence of smoking on graft integration, nonsmokers had significantly ( P = .007) higher graft integration scores at 6 months. Conclusion: Large femoral condylar OCAs treated with autogenous BMC before implantation showed superior radiographic integration to bone and less sclerosis during the initial 6-month postoperative period. BMC treatment of OCAs may mitigate the failure of OCA bone healing.",1

It was hypothesised that DA combined with lateral MAT would improve clinical and radiological outcomes and enable RTS and RTW for most patients. Methods In total, 21 patients with advanced osteoarthritis (moderate to severe joint space narrowing at lateral edge on Rosenberg view and large cartilage defect of lateral femoral condyle) who underwent concomitant DA and MAT were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical outcomes were assessed using subjective knee scores [Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee score, and Tegner activity scale (TAS)] and functional tests (isokinetic extensor muscle strength test, single-leg vertical jump test, and single-leg hop for distance test). The rates of RTS, RTW, and satisfaction were evaluated. Radiological outcomes were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray (Rosenberg view). Results The mean age at surgery and mean follow-up duration were 37.2 +/- 5.9 years and 37.1 +/- 5.4 months, respectively. All improvements in subjective scores were statistically significant (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001). The Lysholm score improved from 58.3 +/- 8.1 to 84.3 +/- 8.2, the IKDC subjective score from 53.9 +/- 10.4 to 78.0 +/- 7.7, and the TAS from 4.0 +/- 0.5 to 5.1 +/- 0.8. The limb symmetry index (LSI) (%) of the extensor peak torque at an angular velocity of 60 degrees/s improved from 67.3 +/- 19.2 to 88.4 +/- 20.3% (p = 0.001). The LSI of the single-leg vertical jump test and single-leg hop for distance test improved from 62.8 +/- 21.3 to 87.7 +/- 19.5% and from 63.9 +/- 20.8 to 85.5 +/- 18.1%, respectively (all, p \textbackslashtextless 0.001). All patients were able to return to any sports activity and work. However, 67% and 90.5% returned to their defined or desired level of sports activity and occupation intensity, respectively. Further, 76.2% were very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the outcome at the last follow-up. The JSW increased by 0.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.6 mm (p = 0.005). In more than 90% of patients, \textbackslashtextgreater 50% of cartilage lesion was covered. The mean graft extrusion was 2.6 +/- 1.0 mm. Conclusion All patients who underwent distraction arthroplasty plus lateral MAT combined with cartilage repair returned to any sports and work at the last follow-up. Significant improvements in clinical outcomes and the radiographic joint space width were observed. However, the activity ability was somewhat reduced compared with the best preoperative level. This one-stage joint salvage treatment is a promising option for young and active patients with advanced OA who wish to return to high levels of sports activity and occupation intensity (\textbackslashtextgreater= Tegner activity scale 4).",0
,[Intraarticular hyaulonic acid injection for sports related chondral lesion of the knee].,"In many cases intraarticular injections of hyaulonic acid were effective for sports related chondral lesion, because the chondral defect is recognized as an early stage of osteoarthritis. But in some young cases whose MRI showed chondral defects the hyaulonic acid injection were not effective and further more treatment might be needed. To those cases arthroscopic microfracture method and succeeding intraarticular hyaulonic injections revealed good results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0717,"Characterization of Ex Vivo–Generated Bovine and Human Cartilage by Immunohistochemical, Biochemical, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analyses","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent age-associated disease involving altered chondrocyte homeostasis and cartilage degeneration. The avascular nature of cartilage and the altered chondrocyte phenotype characteristic of OA severely limit the capacity for in vivo tissue regeneration. Cell- and tissue-based repair has the potential to revolutionize treatment of OA, but those approaches have exhibited limited clinical success to date. In this study, we test the hypothesis that bovine and human chondrocytes in a collagen type I scaffold will form hyaline cartilage ex vivo with immunohistochemical, biochemical, and magnetic resonance (MR) endpoints similar to the original native cartilage. Chondrocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-week-old calf knee cartilage or from cartilage obtained from human total knee arthroplasties, suspended in 2.7 mg/mL collagen I, and plated as 300 microL spot cultures with 5 x 10(6) each. Medium formulations were varied, including the amount of serum, the presence or absence of ascorbate, and treatments with cytokines. Bovine chondrocytes generated metachromatic territorial and interstitial matrix and accumulated type II collagen over time. Type VI collagen was confined primarily to the pericellular region. The ex vivo-formed bovine cartilage contained more chondroitin sulfate per dry weight than native cartilage. Human chondrocytes remained viable and generated metachromatic territorial matrix, but were unable to support interstitial matrix accumulation. MR analysis of ex vivo-formed bovine cartilage revealed evidence of progressively maturing matrix, but MR-derived indices of tissue quality did not reach those of native cartilage. We conclude that the collagen-spot culture model supports formation and maturation of three-dimensional hyaline cartilage from active bovine chondrocytes. Future studies will focus on determining the capacity of human chondrocytes to show comparable tissue formation.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-019-03292-7,No effect of platelet-rich plasma as adjuvant to bone marrow stimulation for the treatment of chondral defects in a large animal model,"BACKGROUND: Bone marrow stimulation (BMS) remains a dominant treatment strategy for symptomatic full thickness articular cartilage defects. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP), may improve biological cartilage repair as an adjunct to BMS. OBJECTIVES: To assess the histological quality of cartilage repair after BMS with and without repeated local injections of PRP for the treatment of full-thickness focal chondral defects of the knee. METHODS: Two full-thickness chondral defects (Ø = 6 mm) were surgically performed in the medial and lateral trochlea of each knee in skeletally mature Göttingen minipigs. The two treatment groups with 12 defect for each groups were (1) BMS with one weekly PRP injection for 4 weeks, and (2) BMS alone. The animals were euthanized after 6 months. Samples of both whole blood and PRP were analysed with an automated hematology analyzer to determine the concentrations of platelets and nucleated cells. The composition of cartilage repair tissue was assessed using gross appearance assessment, histomorphometry and semi-quantitative scoring (ICRS II). RESULTS: The average fold increase in platelets was 10.2 ± 2.2. Leukocyte concentration increased in PRP samples by an average fold change of 7.2 ± 1.3. Our macroscopic findings showed that the defects in the BMS + PRP-treated group, were filled with an irregular, partially rough tissue similar to the BMS-treated group. No significant difference in amount of hyalin cartilage, fibrocartilage or fibrous tissue content and ICRS II scores was found between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Four repeated local injections of leukocyte-rich PRP after BMS in the treatment of full-thickness cartilage injuries demonstrated no beneficial effects in terms of macroscopic and histological cartilage repair tissue quality.",0

To avoid the drawbacks of osteochondral autograft transfer, a cylindrical osteoperiosteal graft harvested from the iliac crest covered by a same-sized cylinder of hyaluronic acid-based polymer scaffold pretreated with bone marrow aspirate concentrate and transferred to the chondral defect recipient site in the exact size for restoration of the subchondral bone and the articular cartilage.",0
,Arthroscopic lavage and debridement for osteoarthritis of the knee: an evidence-based analysis.,"The purpose of this review was to determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of arthroscopic lavage and debridement, with or without lavage, in the treatment of symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, and to conduct an economic analysis if evidence for effectiveness can be established. QUESTIONS ASKED: Does arthroscopic lavage improve motor function and pain associated with OA of the knee?Does arthroscopic debridement improve motor function and pain associated with OA of the knee?If evidence for effectiveness can be established, what is the duration of effect?What are the adverse effects of these procedures?What are the economic considerations if evidence for effectiveness can be established?Osteoarthritis, the most common rheumatologic musculoskeletal disorder, affects about 10% of the Canadian adult population. Although the natural history of OA is not known, it is a degenerative condition that affects the bone cartilage in the joint. It can be diagnosed at earlier ages, particularly within the sports injuries population, though the prevalence of non-injury-related OA increases with increasing age and varies with gender, with women being twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with this condition. Thus, with an aging population, the impact of OA on the health care system is expected to be considerable. Treatments for OA of the knee include conservative or nonpharmacological therapy, like physiotherapy, weight management and exercise; and more generally, intra-articular injections, arthroscopic surgery and knee replacement surgery. Whereas knee replacement surgery is considered an end-of-line intervention, the less invasive surgical procedures of lavage or debridement may be recommended for earlier and more severe disease. Both arthroscopic lavage and debridement are generally indicated in patients with knee joint pain, with or without mechanical problems, that are refractory to medical therapy. The clinical utility of these procedures is unclear, hence, the assessment of their effectiveness in this review. LAVAGE AND DEBRIDEMENT: Arthroscopic lavage involves the visually guided introduction of saline solution into the knee joint and removal of fluid, with the intent of extracting any excess fluids and loose bodies that may be in the knee joint. Debridement, in comparison, may include the introduction of saline into the joint, in addition to the smoothening of bone surface without any further intervention (less invasive forms of debridement), or the addition of more invasive procedures such as abrasion, partial or full meniscectomy, synovectomy, or osteotomy (referred to as debridement in combination with meniscectomy or other procedures). The focus of this health technology assessment is on the effectiveness of lavage, and debridement (with or without meniscal tear resection).THE MEDICAL ADVISORY SECRETARIAT FOLLOWED ITS STANDARD PROCEDURES AND SEARCHED THESE ELECTRONIC DATABASES: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and The International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment. THE KEYWORDS SEARCHED WERE: arthroscopy, debridement, lavage, wound irrigation, or curettage; arthritis, rheumatoid, osteoarthritis; osteoarthritis, knee; knee or knee joint. TIME FRAME: Only 2 previous health technology assessments were identified, one of which was an update of the other, and included 3 of 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the first report. Therefore, the search period for inclusion of studies in this assessment was January 1, 1995 to April 24, 2005. EXCLUDED WERE: case reports, comments, editorials, and letters. Identified were 335 references, including previously published health technology assessments, and 5 articles located through a manual search of references from published articles and health technology assessments. These were examined against the criteria, as described below, which resulted in the inclusion of 1 health technology assessment and its corresponding update, and 4 articles (2 RCTs and 2 level 4 studies) for arthroscopic lavage and 8 papers (2 RCTs and 6 level 4 studies) for arthroscopic debridement.English-language articles from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, and health technology assessments from January 1, 1995 onwardStudies on OA of the knee with a focus on the outcomes of motor function and painStudies of arthroscopic procedures onlyStudies in which meniscal tear resection/meniscectomy (partial or full) has been conducted in conjunction with lavage or debridement.Studies that focus on inflammatory OA, joint tuberculosis, septic joints, psoriatic joints (e.g., psoriatic knee joint synovitis), synovitis, chondropathy of the knee and gonarthrosis (which includes varotic gonarthrosis)Studies that focus on rheumatoid arthritisStudies that focus on meniscal tears from an acute injury (e.g., sports injury)Studies that are based on lavage or debridement for microfracture of the kneeStudies in which other surgical procedures (e.g., high tibial osteotomy, synovectomy, have been conducted in addition to lavage/debridement)Studies based on malalignment of the knee (e.g., varus/valgus arthritic conditions).Studies that compare lavage to lavage plus drug therapyStudies on procedures that are not arthroscopic (i.e., visually guided) (e.g., nonarthroscopic lavage)Studies of OA in children.Arthroscopic lavage or debridement, with or without meniscectomy, for the treatment of motor function symptoms and pain associated with OA of the knee.Studies in which there was a comparison group of either diseased or healthy subjects or one in which subjects were their own control were included. Comparisons to other treatments included placebo (or sham) arthroscopy. Sham arthroscopy involved making small incisions and manipulating the knee, without the insertion of instruments.IN EARLY OA OF THE KNEE WITH PAIN REFRACTORY TO MEDICAL TREATMENT, THERE IS LEVEL 1B EVIDENCE THAT: Arthroscopic lavage gives rise to a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful effect in improving pain (WOMAC pain and VAS pain) up to 12 months following surgery. The effect on joint function (WOMAC function) and the primary outcome (WOMAC aggregate) was neither statistically nor clinically significant. IN MODERATE OR SEVERE OA OF THE KNEE WITH PAIN REFRACTORY TO MEDICAL TREATMENT, THERE IS: Level 1b evidence that the effect on pain and function of arthroscopic lavage (10 L saline) and debridement (with 10 L saline lavage) is not statistically significant up to 24 months following surgery.Level 2 evidence that arthroscopic debridement (with 3 L saline lavage) is effective in the control of pain in severe OA of the medial femoral condyle for up to 5 years.For debridement in combination with meniscectomy, there is level 4 evidence that the procedure, as appropriate, might be effective in earlier stages, unicompartmental disease, shorter symptom duration, sudden onset of mechanical symptoms, and preoperative full range of motion. However, as these findings are derived from very poor quality evidence, the identification of subsets of patients that may benefit from this procedure requires further testing.In patients with pain due to a meniscal tear, of the medial compartment in particular, repair of the meniscus results in better pain control at 2 years following surgery than if the pain is attributable to other causes. There is insufficient evidence to comment on the effectiveness of lateral meniscus repair on pain control.Arthroscopic debridement of the knee has thus far only been found to be effective for medial compartmental OA. All other indications should be reviewed with a view to reducing arthroscopic debridement as an effective therapy. Arthroscopic lavage of the knee is not indicated for any stage of OA. There is very poor quality evidence on the effectiveness of debridement with partial meniscectomy in the case of meniscal tears in OA of the knee.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0590,Strategies for Articular Cartilage Lesion Repair and Functional Restoration,"Injury of articular cartilage due to trauma or pathological conditions is the major cause of disability worldwide, especially in North America. The increasing number of patients suffering from joint-related conditions leads to a concomitant increase in the economic burden. In this review article, we focus on strategies to repair and replace knee joint cartilage, since knee-associated disabilities are more prevalent than any other joint. Because of inadequacies associated with widely used approaches, the orthopedic community has an increasing tendency to develop biological strategies, which include transplantation of autologous (i.e., mosaicplasty) or allogeneic osteochondral grafts, autologous chondrocytes (autologous chondrocyte transplantation), or tissue-engineered cartilage substitutes. Tissue-engineered cartilage constructs represent a highly promising treatment option for knee injury as they mimic the biomechanical environment of the native cartilage and have superior integration capabilities. Currently, a wide range of tissue-engineering-based strategies are established and investigated clinically as an alternative to the routinely used techniques (i.e., knee replacement and autologous chondrocyte transplantation). Tissue-engineering-based strategies include implantation of autologous chondrocytes in combination with collagen I, collagen I/III (matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation), HYAFF 11 (Hyalograft C), and fibrin glue (Tissucol) or implantation of minced cartilage in combination with copolymers of polyglycolic acid along with polycaprolactone (cartilage autograft implantation system), and fibrin glue (DeNovo NT graft). Tissue-engineered cartilage replacements show better clinical outcomes in the short term, and with advances that have been made in orthopedics they can be introduced arthroscopically in a minimally invasive fashion. Thus, the future is bright for this innovative approach to restore function.",0
https://doi.org/10.22203/ecm.v041a04,Long term outcomes of biomaterial-mediated repair of focal cartilage defects in a large animal model,"The repair of focal cartilage defects remains one of the foremost issues in the field of orthopaedics. Chondral defects may arise from a variety of joint pathologies and left untreated, will likely progress to osteoarthritis. Current repair techniques, such as microfracture, result in short-term clinical improvements but have poor long-term outcomes. Emerging scaffold-based repair strategies have reported superior outcomes compared to microfracture and motivate the development of new biomaterials for this purpose. In this study, unique composite implants consisting of a base porous reinforcing component (woven poly(ε-caprolactone)) infiltrated with 1 of 2 hydrogels (self-assembling peptide or thermo-gelling hyaluronan) or bone marrow aspirate were evaluated. The objective was to evaluate cartilage repair with composite scaffold treatment compared to the current standard of care (microfracture) in a translationally relevant large animal model, the Yucatan minipig. While many cartilage-repair studies have shown some success in vivo, most are short term and not clinically relevant. Informed by promising 6-week findings, a 12-month study was carried out and those results are presented here. To aid in comparisons across platforms, several structural and functionally relevant outcome measures were performed. Despite positive early findings, the long-term results indicated less than optimal structural and mechanical results with respect to cartilage repair, with all treatment groups performing worse than the standard of care. This study is important in that it brings much needed attention to the importance of performing translationally relevant long-term studies in an appropriate animal model when developing new clinical cartilage repair approaches.",0

Methods Articular cartilage defects were created in 27 New Zealand White rabbits with body weight of about 2.5 kg. Model rabbits were randomly assigned into three treatment groups (n = 9 per group). Experimental group was implanted with collagen-BMSC-DBM scaffold. Experimental control group was treated with collagen-DBM scaffold only, while the negative control received no treatment. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperative 3 rabbits from each group were sacrificed. Gross appearances of the articular samples were photographed. The 12-week samples were further examined using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and safranin O staining, following by Wakitani scoring. Results When examined at 12 weeks after the implantation of constructs, cartilage defects of the experimental group were repaired with the tissue exhibited a smooth surface and be well-integrated with the circumjacent native cartilage. The repaired cartilage also demonstrated positive safranin O staining. For the experimental control group, the defects were partially repaired with an identifiable interface seen between the repaired and native cartilage tissues. For the negative controls, no repair could be seen and the defects were only filled with fibrous tissue. The Wakitani score of the experimental group was 1.89 +/- 0.42, while that of the experimental control and negative control groups was 5.96 +/- 0.65 and 12.83 +/- 0.58, respectively. The differences in Wakitani score between different treatments were statistical significant (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Conclusion The present study demonstrates DBM scaffold combined with type II collagen-encapsulated BMSC can be a potential tissue engineering approach for the repair of articular cartilage defect.",0

OCD most commonly affects the knee, followed by the elbow and ankle. Adolescents and young adults are most commonly affected. Patients present with vague, often intermittent symptoms and generally have no history of acute injury. Although diagnosis can be made with plain radiographs, treatment decisions are generally based on MRI. Skeletal maturity and stability of the OCD lesion determine treatment. Treatments range from immobilization and activity restriction to operative therapies. Clinical indications are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603516644298,Operative Treatment for Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus,"Objective Numerous basic science articles have published evidence supporting the use of biologic augmentation in the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT). However, a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical outcomes of those treatment modalities in OLT has yet to be published. The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence-based overview of clinical outcomes following biologic augmentation to surgical treatments for OLT. Design A comprehensive literature review was performed. Two commonly used surgical techniques for the treatment of OLT—bone marrow stimulation and osteochondral autograft transfer—are first introduced. The review describes the operative indications, step-by- step operative procedure, clinical outcomes, and concerns associated with each treatment. A review of the currently published basic science and clinical evidence on biologic augmentation in the surgical treatments for OLT, including platelet-rich plasma, concentrated bone marrow aspirate, and scaffold-based therapy follows. Results Biologic agents and scaffold-based therapies appear to be promising agents, capable of improving both clinical and radiological outcomes in OLT. Nevertheless, variable production methods of these biologic augmentations confound the interpretation of clinical outcomes of cases treated with these agents. Conclusions Current clinical evidence supports the use of biologic agents in OLT cases. Nonetheless, well-designed clinical trials with patient-specific, validated and objective outcome measurements are warranted to develop standardized clinical guidelines for the use of biologic augmentation for the treatment of OLT in clinical practice.",0

In our current pilot study, we studied patients with mild-to-moderate bilateral knee osteoarthritis, compared pain at 12-month follow-up between BMAC-injected and saline-injected knees, and examined cartilage appearance measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 quantitative mapping. Design Twenty-five patients with mild-to-moderate bilateral osteoarthritic knee pain were randomized to receive BMAC into one knee and saline placebo into the other. Bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crests, concentrated in an automated centrifuge, combined with platelet-poor plasma for knee injection, and compared with saline injection into the contralateral knee. Primary outcome measures were T2 MRI cartilage mapping at 6-month and Visual Analog Scale and Osteoarthritis Research Society International Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain scores and radiographs at 12-month follow-up. Results Constant, intermittent, and overall knee pain remained significantly decreased from baseline at 12-month follow-up (all P ⩽ 0.01), with no apparent difference between BMAC- and saline-treated knees (all P ⩾ 0.54). A similar significant increase from baseline to 12-month follow-up regarding quality of life was observed for both BMAC- and saline-treated knees (all P ⩽ 0.04). T2 quantitative MRI mapping showed no significant changes as a result of treatment. Conclusions BMAC is safe to perform and relieves pain from knee arthritis but showed no superiority to saline injection at 12-month follow-up. MRI cartilage sequences failed to show regenerative benefit with single BMAC injection. The mechanisms of action that led to pain relief remain unclear and warrant further studies.",0

After gene expression determination, cells were mixed with calcium alginate gel. Osteochondral defects were created on the femoral condyle of goats in a diameter of 6mm. Osteochondral plugs were harvested from the intertrochlea groove and pressed into the recipient sites in a mosaic mode. Gene modified BMSCs–scaffold complex was applied to fill the residual defects. Control groups were also set up. At 4 and 16weeks, specimens were investigated in gross and under microscopy, electromicroscopy and MRI detection. <h3>Results</h3> hIGF-I gene was expressed effectively with the peak concentration at 34.75ng/ml. Subchondral bone and cartilage were integrated well in gene enhanced Mosaicplasty group. The reconstructed tissue filled up the gaps between columns, which appeared better than other groups. The regenerated cartilage was integrated with neighbor tightly in regular arrange. Extracellular matrix distributed evenly and deeply stained by alcian blue. Quantitative histologic assessments showed higher score in gene enhanced Mosaicplasty group. Glycosaminoglycan assay revealed no difference between groups involving Mosaicplasty. MRI analysis demonstrated the healing process between the subchondral bone other than control groups. <h3>Conclusions</h3> hIGF-I gene enhanced tissue engineering can modify the outcome of Mosaicplasty to reconstruct large osteochondral defects in weight-bearing region.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2005.02.010,The detached osteochondral fragment as a source of cells for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in the ankle joint,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been successfully used for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus. One of the main problems of this surgical strategy is related to the harvesting of the cartilage slice from a healthy knee. The aim of this study was to examine the capacity of chondrocytes harvested from a detached osteochondral fragment to proliferate and to serve as a source of viable cells for ACI in the repair of ankle cartilage defects.Detached osteochondral fragments harvested from the ankle joint of 20 patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus served as the source of human articular cartilage specimens. All of the osteochondral lesions were chronic and of traumatic origin. In all cases, the fragments were utilized to evaluate the viability and proliferation of the cells, the histological appearance of the cartilage tissue and the expression of specific cartilage markers by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the 16 patients scheduled for ACI, the expanded chondrocytes were used for chondrocyte implantation. In the other 4 patients, with lesion size <1.5cm(2), microfractures were created during the initial arthroscopic step. As a control group, 7 patients with comparable osteochondral lesions underwent the same surgery, but received chondrocytes harvested from the ipsilateral knee.According to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Scoring (AOFAS) system, patients in the experimental group had a preoperative score of 54.2+/-16 points and a postoperative one of 89+/-9.6 points after a minimum follow-up time of 12 months (P<0.0005). The control group of patients had a preoperative score of 54.6+/-11.7 points and a postoperative one of 90.2+/-9.7 points at a minimum follow-up time of 12 months (P<0.0005). The clinical results of the two groups did not differ significantly from each other. Chondrocytes isolated from the detached fragments were highly viable, phenotypically stable, proliferated in culture and redifferentiated when grown within the three-dimensional scaffold used for ACI. The morphological and molecular characteristics of the cartilage samples obtained from the detached osteochondral fragments were similar to those of healthy hyaline articular cartilage.The good results achieved with this strategy indicate that cells derived from the lesioned area may be useful in the treatment of osteochondral defects of the talus.",0
https://doi.org/10.22203/ecm.v031a06,Chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells in a novel hyaluronate-collagen-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds for knee repair,"Scaffolds are expected to play a key role in the induction of chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cartilage tissue regeneration. Here, we report the development of a novel tricalcium phosphate-collagen-hyaluronate (TCP-COL-HA) scaffold that can function as a stem cell carrier to induce chondrogenesis and promote cartilage repair, and the investigation of chondroinductive properties of scaffolds containing varying amounts of TCP, COL and HA. TCP-COL-HA scaffolds, as well as TCP-COL scaffolds at two different TCP/COL ratios (50:50 and 25:75), were evaluated for their ability to induce cartilage regeneration from rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated by sulphated glycosaminoglycan quantification, collagen type II immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Mechanical strength was evaluated by the compression test. The results showed that the TCP-COL-HA scaffolds enhanced rMSC chondrogenesis to a greater degree than did the TCP-COL scaffolds; for the latter, the scaffold with the lower TCP/COL ratio (25:75) was superior in terms of promoting rMSC chondrogenesis. Similar results were obtained in an ectopic implantation model in nude mice. In a critical-size rabbit osteochondral defect-repair model, rMSCs seeded on TCP-COL-HA scaffolds showed greater cartilage regeneration and integration into surrounding tissue than the TCP-COL groups, in which cartilage repair was more efficient at the 25:75 than at the 50:50 ratio. These results indicate that the addition of HA and different TCP/COL ratios can affect the chondroinductive capacity of scaffolds, and suggest that the TCP-COL-HA scaffold can serve as an effective cell carrier for cartilage regeneration.",0

A total of 24 bi-layer (5 mm, four in each condyle) or three-layer C-HA scaffolds (8 mm, eight in the trochlea, four in each condyle) were first press-fit implanted and underwent testing with CPM, 90 cycles, 0°-90°. The second set of 24 scaffolds was implanted in cleaned lesions with the addition of fibrin glue. Two knees with fibrin glue fixation were additionally exposed to 15 kg loading, with 30 cycles of CPM, 0°-30°. Then, the knees were reopened and the scaffolds were evaluated using semi-quantitative Drobnic and modified Bekkers scores.All but two scaffolds remained in the lesions site throughout CPM. Two implants failed: both were bi-layer osteochondral scaffolds, press-fit implanted at the lateral femoral condyle (LFC). A statistically significant difference was obtained between press-fit and fibrin glue implants with both Drobnic (2.9 ± 0.7 vs 4.3 ± 0.1, P < 0.0005) and Bekkers (3.3 ± 1.0 vs 5.0 ± 0.1, P < 0.0005) scores. Additional knee loading did not affect fibrin glue scaffold fixation or integrity.This cadaveric study showed fibrin glue notably improved bi-layer or three-layer C-HA scaffold press-fit fixation regardless of lesion location. It is therefore recommended that fibrin glue be used during surgery to improve early post-operative C-HA scaffold stability and integrity.",0

They were randomized to receive BMSCs with MFX (cell-T group, n=7) or MFX alone (control group, n=4). Clinical results were evaluated using International Knee Documentation committee (IKDC) knee evaluation questionnaires and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) before and 48 weeks after surgery. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of repair tissue were carried out at 48 weeks by T2 mapping of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring system with follow-up MRI.No significant differences between preoperative and postoperative IKDC and KOOS were observed in the cell-T or control group. However, forty-eight weeks after surgery, the cell-T group showed a trend for a greater KOOS QOL score compared with the control group (79.4 vs. 39.1, respectively; P=0.07). The T2 value did not differ significantly between the two groups, but the mean MOCART score was significantly higher in the cell-T group than in the control group (P=0.02).Compared with MFX alone, BMSC transplantation with MFX resulted in better postoperative healing of the cartilage and subchondral bone as determined by the MOCART score. Clinically, BMSC transplantation with MFX gave a higher KOOS QOL score after 48 weeks.",1

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether incorporation of the power of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sheet to MSCs-loaded bilayer poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds can improve the integration and repair of cartilage defects in a rabbit model. Rabbit bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured and formed cell sheet. Full-thickness cylindrical osteochondral defects (4 mm in diameter, 3 mm in depth) were created in the patellar groove of 18 New Zealand white rabbits and the osteochondral defects were treated with PLGA scaffold (n = 6), PLGA/MSCs (n = 6) or MSC sheet-encapsulated PLGA/MSCs (n = 6). After 6 and 12 weeks, the integration and tissue response were evaluated histologically. The MSC sheet-encapsulated PLGA/MCSs group showed significantly more amounts of hyaline cartilage and higher histological scores than PLGA/MSCs group and PLGA group (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). In addition, the MSC sheet-encapsulated PLGA/MCSs group showed the best integration between the repaired cartilage and surrounding normal cartilage and subchondral bone compared to other two groups. The novel method of incorporation of MSC sheet to PLGA/MCSs could enhance the ability of cartilage regeneration and integration between repair cartilage and the surrounding cartilage. Transplantation of autologous MSC sheet combined with traditional strategies or cartilage debris might provide therapeutic opportunities for improving cartilage regeneration and integration in humans.",0

Patients with significant chondral defects frequently have persistent joint line pain, swelling, and catching in the knee. In contrast to marrow stimulation treatment techniques, such as abrasion arthroplasty, drilling, or microfracture which populate the defect with pluripotential stem cells, the use of cultured autologous chondrocytes fills the defect with cells of a committed pathway to develop hyaline-like cartilage. This hyaline-like cartilage more closely recreates the wear characteristics and durability of normal hyaline cartilage than the fibrous or fibrocartilage repair tissue formed by pluripotential stem cells. The purpose of this paper is to review the efficacy of available treatment options as well as the basic science rationale, indications, technique, postoperative rehabilitation, and clinical results of using cultured autologous chondrocytes in the treatment of focal full thickness chondral defects of the knee.",0

Design This assessor-blinded trial evaluates ChonDux hydrogel scaffold implantation in combination with microfracture in 18 patients across 6 sites. Male and female patients 18 to 65 years of age with full-thickness femoral condyle defects 2 to 4 cm 2 in area were enrolled. Eligible patients received ChonDux treatment followed by rehabilitation. Defect volume fill was evaluated after 3, 6 (primary outcome), 12, 18, and 24 months by assessor blinded magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis. Secondary outcomes were T2-weighted MRI relaxation time and patient surveys via visual analogue scale (VAS) pain and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee function scoring. Results ChonDux maintained durable tissue restoration over 24 months with final defect percent fill of 94.2% ± 16.3% and no significant loss of fill volume at any time points. Tissues treated with ChonDux maintained T2 relaxation times similar to uninjured cartilage between 12 and 24 months. VAS pain scoring decreased between 1 and 6 weeks, and IKDC knee function scores improved by approximately 30.1 with ChonDux over 24 months. Conclusion ChonDux treatment is a safe adjunct to microfracture therapy and promotes stable restoration of full thickness articular cartilage defects for at least 24 months.",0

The purpose of this study was to analyse the clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up. The hypothesis was that a cartilage repair procedure may add some benefit to isolated axial correction. Methods 56 patients affected by medial osteoarthcritis in a varus knee were retrospectively investigated: 20 patients were treated by HTO, 18 by HTO + ACI and 18 by HTO + MFX. All patients underwent clinical assessment following HSS and WOMAC rating scores and a radiographic study was performed preoperatively and at follow-up. The statistical analysis confirmed that the three groups of patients were homogeneous regarding clinical, radiographical and anatomopathological patterns; differences have been reported in body mass index (BMI). Results At final follow-up, improvements in clinical and radiographical results were obtained in all patients. HTO and HTO + ACI series showed significantly higher scores compared to the HTO + MFX series. Conclusions At more than 11 years of follow-up, isolated HTO and HTO + ACI treatments showed satisfactory results similar to those reported in the literature with no evidence of superiority of the addition of ACI to isolated HTO. MFX associated with HTO provided the worst results in the series.",0

In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die derzeitigen Methoden und Erkenntnisse zur Diagnose und operativen Behandlung von Knorpelläsionen dargestellt, um hieraus geeignete Therapieempfehlungen für das Hüftgelenk abzuleiten. Material und Methoden Übersichtsarbeit zur Ätiologie und Therapie von Knorpelschäden am Hüftgelenk unter Berücksichtigung der aktuellen Literatur mit Darstellung der Studienlage und der Diskussion von Vor- und Nachteilen verschiedener operativer Verfahren zum Gelenkerhalt. Ergebnisse In den meisten der bisher publizierten Studien zur operativen Behandlung von Knorpelschäden des Hüftgelenks wurden Defekte behandelt, die am Azetabulum durch ein FAI vom Cam-Typ ausgelöst werden. Ihre Entstehung kann durch rechtzeitige Beseitigung der pathologisch relevanten Deformitäten verhindert werden. Für die Therapie bereits bestehender vollschichtiger Knorpelläsionen werden derzeit fast ausschließlich knochenmarkstimulierende Techniken und die matrixgekoppelte autologe Knorpelzelltransplantation (MACT) eingesetzt. Für die Hüfte existieren zu diesen Verfahren bisher nur Studien auf geringem Evidenzniveau, was vor allem in der noch jungen Historie der Knorpelchirurgie in diesem Gelenk begründet ist. Allerdings ist schon jetzt zu erkennen, dass sich einige Erfahrungen mit den genannten Methoden vom Knie auf die Hüfte übertragen lassen. Schlussfolgerung Bei umschriebenen und vollschichtigen Knorpelschäden ab 1,5 – 2 cm2 stellt die MACT das zu bevorzugende Therapieverfahren dar, sofern keine wesentliche Gelenkdegeneration besteht. Ähnlich wie im Knie kann keine gesicherte obere Altersgrenze für einen gelenkerhaltenden Eingriff oder eine MACT im Hüftgelenk festgelegt werden, da das numerische nicht zwangsläufig mit dem biologischen Patientenalter bzw. Gelenkzustand korreliert. Wie für andere Gelenke auch, sind Langzeitbeobachtungen und die Durchführung prospektiv randomisierter Studien anzuraten.",0
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3927,Augmented cartilage regeneration by implantation of cellular versus acellular implants after bone marrow stimulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies,"Bone marrow stimulation may be applied to regenerate focal cartilage defects, but generally results in transient clinical improvement and formation of fibrocartilage rather than hyaline cartilage. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strive to develop new solutions to regenerate hyaline cartilage tissue. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of current literature and assesses the efficacy of articular cartilage regeneration by implantation of cell-laden versus cell-free biomaterials in the knee and ankle joint in animals after bone marrow stimulation. PubMed and EMBASE (via OvidSP) were systematically searched using tissue engineering, cartilage and animals search strategies. Included were primary studies in which cellular and acellular biomaterials were implanted after applying bone marrow stimulation in the knee or ankle joint in healthy animals. Study characteristics were tabulated and outcome data were collected for meta-analysis for studies applying semi-quantitative histology as outcome measure (117 studies). Cartilage regeneration was expressed on an absolute 0–100% scale and random effects meta-analyses were performed. Implantation of cellular biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 18.6% compared to acellular biomaterials. No significant differences were found between biomaterials loaded with stem cells and those loaded with somatic cells. Culture conditions of cells did not affect cartilage regeneration. Cartilage formation was reduced with adipose-derived stem cells compared to other cell types, but still improved compared to acellular scaffolds. Assessment of the risk of bias was impaired due to incomplete reporting for most studies. Implantation of cellular biomaterials improves cartilage regeneration compared to acellular biomaterials.",0

Chart review, patient questionnaires, and validated knee function assessment tools were used: International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form scores ranged from 0 (maximal disability) to 100 (no disability). Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index scores ranged from 0% (no disability) to 100% (maximal disability). Magnetic resonance imaging and radiographs were obtained on the donor knee on the majority of patients.Questionnaire response rate was 79% (45 of 57 patients). Average patient age was 35 ± 11 years (range, 19-70 years). Average postoperative follow-up was 27 ± 17 months (range, 9-108 months). The indication for MFT flap reconstruction was scaphoid nonunion in 30 patients and Kienböck disease in 15 patients. All 45 patients had a stable knee on examination. Magnetic resonance and radiographic imaging obtained on 35 patients exhibited no pathological changes. Average duration of postoperative pain was 56 ± 59 days (range, 0-360 days); average duration until patients reported the knee returning to normal was 90 ± 60 days (range, 14-360 days).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149121,Integration of Stem Cell to Chondrocyte-Derived Cartilage Matrix in Healthy and Osteoarthritic States in the Presence of Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles,"We investigated the effectiveness of integrating tissue engineered cartilage derived from human bone marrow derived stem cells (HBMSCs) to healthy as well as osteoarthritic cartilage mimics using hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles immersed within a hydrogel substrate. Healthy and diseased engineered cartilage from human chondrocytes (cultured in agar gels) were integrated with human bone marrow stem cell (HBMSC)-derived cartilaginous engineered matrix with and without HA, and evaluated after 28 days of growth. HBMSCs were seeded within photopolymerizable poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels. In addition, we also conducted a preliminary in vivo evaluation of cartilage repair in rabbit knee chondral defects treated with subchondral bone microfracture and cell-free PEGDA with and without HA. Under in vitro conditions, the interfacial shear strength between tissue engineered cartilage derived from HBMSCs and osteoarthritic chondrocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) when HA nanoparticles were incorporated within the HBMSC culture system. Histological evidence confirmed a distinct spatial transition zone, rich in calcium phosphate deposits. Assessment of explanted rabbit knees by histology demonstrated that cellularity within the repair tissues that had filled the defects were of significantly higher number (p < 0.05) when HA was used. HA nanoparticles play an important role in treating chondral defects when osteoarthritis is a co-morbidity. We speculate that the calcified layer formation at the interface in the osteoarthritic environment in the presence of HA is likely to have attributed to higher interfacial strength found in vitro. From an in vivo standpoint, the presence of HA promoted cellularity in the tissues that subsequently filled the chondral defects. This higher presence of cells can be considered important in the context of accelerating long-term cartilage remodeling. We conclude that HA nanoparticles play an important role in engineered to native cartilage integration and cellular processes.",0

Cartilage treatment strategies have previously been characterized as palliation (ie, chondroplasty and debridement), repair (ie, drilling and microfracture), or restoration (ie, autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft, and osteochondral allograft). The osteochondral autograft transplantation procedure allows defects to be filled immediately with mature, hyaline articular cartilage by utilizing either an arthroscopic or a mini-open procedure. Graft harvest and placement can be technically demanding, but results show trends toward greater longevity, durability, and improved outcomes in high-demand patients when compared with alternative techniques. Improved results are shown in younger patients with isolated lesions between 1 and 4 cm.",0

Systematic Review of Literature,"Treatment of osteochondral defects remains a challenge in orthopedic surgery. The TruFit plug has been investigated as a potential treatment method for osteochondral defects. This is a biphasic scaffold designed to stimulate cartilage and subchondral bone formation. The aim of this study is to investigate clinical, radiological, and histological efficacy of the TruFit plug in restoring osteochondral defects in the joint.We performed a systematic search in five databases for clinical trials in which patients were treated with a TruFit plug for osteochondral defects. Studies had to report clinical, radiological, or histological outcome data. Quality of the included studies was assessed.Five studies describe clinical results, all indicating improvement at follow-up of 12 months compared to preoperative status. However, two studies reporting longer follow-up show deterioration of early improvement. Radiological evaluation indicates favorable MRI findings regarding filling of the defect and incorporation with adjacent cartilage at 24 months follow-up, but conflicting evidence exists on the properties of the newly formed overlying cartilage surface. None of the included studies showed evidence for bone ingrowth. The few histological data available confirmed these results.There are no data available that support superiority or equality of TruFit compared to conservative treatment or mosaicplasty/microfracture. Further investigation is needed to improve synthetic biphasic implants as therapy for osteochondral lesions. Randomized controlled clinical trials comparing TruFit plugs with an established treatment method are needed before further clinical use can be supported.",0

The concentrations of BMP-2 and BMP-7 were determined by ELISA. The clinical status was evaluated using the IKDC Score prior to and 1 year following the operation.High level expression in the control group was found for BMP-2, concentrations of BMP-7 remained below detection levels. No statistical differences could be detected in concentrations of BMP-2 or BMP-7 in the lavage fluids of knees with cartilage lesions compared to the control group. Levels of BMP-7 did not change after surgical cartilage repair, whereas concentrations of BMP-2 statistically significant increased after the intervention (p < 0.001). The clinical outcome following cartilage regenerating surgery increased after 1 year by 29% (p < 0.001). The difference of the IKDC score after 1 year and prior to the operation was used to quantify the degree of improvement following surgery. This difference statistically significant correlated with initial BMP-2 (R = 0.554, p < 0.001) but not BMP-7 (R = 0.031, n.s.) levels in the knee joints.BMP-2 seems to play an important role in surgically induced cartilage repair; synovial expression correlates with the clinical outcome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2015.0577,Hyaline Articular Matrix Formed by Dynamic Self-Regenerating Cartilage and Hydrogels,"Injuries to the articular cartilage surface are challenging to repair because cartilage possesses a limited capacity for self-repair. The outcomes of current clinical procedures aimed to address these injuries are inconsistent and unsatisfactory. We have developed a novel method for generating hyaline articular cartilage to improve the outcome of joint surface repair. A suspension of 10(7) swine chondrocytes was cultured under reciprocating motion for 14 days. The resulting dynamic self-regenerating cartilage (dSRC) was placed in a cartilage ring and capped with fibrin and collagen gel. A control group consisted of chondrocytes encapsulated in fibrin gel. Constructs were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and harvested after 6 weeks. Gross, histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and biomechanical analyses were performed. In swine patellar groove, dSRC was implanted into osteochondral defects capped with collagen gel and compared to defects filled with osteochondral plugs, collagen gel, or left empty after 6 weeks. In mice, the fibrin- and collagen-capped dSRC constructs showed enhanced contiguous cartilage matrix formation over the control of cells encapsulated in fibrin gel. Biochemically, the fibrin and collagen gel dSRC groups were statistically improved in glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline content compared to the control. There was no statistical difference in the biomechanical data between the dSRC groups and the control. The swine model also showed contiguous cartilage matrix in the dSRC group but not in the collagen gel and empty defects. These data demonstrate the survivability and successful matrix formation of dSRC under the mechanical forces experienced by normal hyaline cartilage in the knee joint. The results from this study demonstrate that dSRC capped with hydrogels successfully engineers contiguous articular cartilage matrix in both nonload-bearing and load-bearing environments.",0

This study was done to measure the clinical efficacy of Hyalofast grafting after microfractures. Methods: Forty-six patients were assessed for knee function using knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) after undergoing microfracture and Hyalofast grafting surgery. We further divided the 46 patients into a group of 10 patients who had no associated procedures done with the microfracture and Hyalofast grafting surgery. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected knee pre-surgery and two patients had MRI done post-surgery. Due to another unrelated injury, we were also able to obtain further arthroscopic findings of another patient’s knee 18 months after microfracture and Hyalofast grafting. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in all categories of the KOOS (symptoms, pain, daily living, sports and quality of life) compared between years 1, 2 and 3 against pre-surgery. For the subgroup of Hyalofast only, there was a statistically significant improvement in symptoms, pain and daily living categories of the KOOS compared between years 1, 2 and 3 against pre-surgery. Conclusions: Our study shows that Hyalofast grafting after microfracture is a viable alternative to treatment for patients with grade 4 cartilage ulcers.",0

Although the disease is chronic, it significantly reduces the patient’s quality of life. At present, stem cell therapy is considered to be an efficient approach for treating this condition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show the most potential for stem cell therapy of osteoarthritis. In fact, MSCs can differentiate into certain mesodermal tissues such as cartilage and bone. Therefore, in the present study, we applied adipose tissue-derived MSCs to osteoarthritis treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficiency of autologous adipose tissue-derived MSC transplantation in patients with confirmed osteoarthritis at grade II and III. Adipose tissue was isolated from the belly, and used for extraction of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). The SVF was mixed with activated platelet-rich plasma before injection. The clinical efficiencies were evaluated by the pain score (VAS), Lysholm score, and MRI findings. We performed the procedure in 21 cases from 2012 to 2013. All 21 patients showed improved joint function after 8.5 months. The pain score decreased from 7.6±0.5 before injection to 3.5±0.7 at 3 months and 1.5±0.5 at 6 months after injection. The Lysholm score increased from 61±11 before injection to 82±8.1 after injection. Significant improvements were noted in MRI findings, with increased thickness of the cartilage layer. Moreover, there were no side-effects or complications related to microorganism infection, graft rejection, or tumorigenesis. These results provide a new opportunity for osteoarthritis treatment.

Tissue engineered autologous cartilagenous tissue was cultured on calcium phosphate cylinders and implanted into osteochondral defects into the femoral condyles in minipigs. Radiological follow-up was performed at 2, 8, 26 and 52 weeks, condyles were harvested 26 and 52 weeks post-implantation. Thickness of cultivated tissue (1.10 +/- 0.55 mm) was comparable to in situ cartilage and cells produced in vitro cartilage specific proteins. In vivo, 26 and 52 weeks post-implantation defects were resurfaced with hyaline-like tissue, the implants were well integrated with no gap at the interface between the engineered neocartilage and the adjacent articular cartilage. Synthesis of type II collagen was detected 26 and 52 weeks after implantation. The modified ICRS score increased from 26 to 52 weeks. Histomorphometric evaluation revealed a decrease in cellularity in tissue engineered cartilage from 2.2-fold of native cartilage after 26 weeks to 1.5-fold after 52 weeks. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the integration and maturation of tissue engineered cartilage pellets attached on a bone substitute carrier implanted in osteochondral defects over a long time.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00776-009-1349-4,Development of a new method to harvest chondroprogenitor cells from underneath cartilage defects in the knees,"Mesenchymal progenitor cells from bone marrow hold great potential as a cell source for cartilage repair. Aspiration from the iliac crest is the most widely used method to harvest bone marrow cells for cartilage repair. The objective of our study was to establish a new method to isolate mesenchymal progenitor cells by direct aspiration of bone marrow from the subchondral spongious bone underneath cartilage defects during microfracture treatment and to confirm the chondrogenic potential of the resulting cell cultures.Bone marrow was aspirated arthroscopically from patients treated for isolated cartilage defects. Adherent stromal cells were isolated, expanded in monolayer cultures, and characterized by flow cytometry. Chondrogenic induction of cells was achieved by combination of spheroid cultures in hanging drops and the concomitant use of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). Articular chondrocytes established in three-dimensional (3D) cultures were used as positive cartilage-forming units, and skin fibroblasts were used as negative controls. Three-dimensional constructs were stained for immunohistochemical and histological examination, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify the expression of aggrecan, collagen types 1 and 2, and Sox9.Mesenchymal stem cell-like progenitor cells (MSCs) displaying chondrogenic differentiation capacity were harvested arthroscopically from underneath cartilage lesions on distal femurs using the one-hole technique. Stem cell-related surface antigens analyzed by flow cytometry confirmed the nature of the isolated adherent cells. MSC spheroids stained positive for glycosaminoglycans and collagen type 2. Realtime PCR showed that MSCs in 3D spheroids significantly increased gene expression of collagen type 2, aggrecan, and Sox 9 and down-regulated expression of collagen type 1 when compared to the mRNA levels measured in MSCs monolayers.We describe a new technique that may be applied for harvesting bone marrow cells from cartilage defects during arthroscopic intervention of the knee. Cells harvested in this way hold full chondrogenic differentiation potential. Our data imply that MSC storage may be established by using marrow from this approach, bypassing the need for cell aspiration from the iliac crest.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.st.20.00032,Osteochondral Autograft Transplantation for Capitellar Osteochondritis Dissecans,"The goal of the osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) procedure is to replace both the bone and cartilage that have been compromised by osteonecrosis of the capitellum, a condition known as osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). In children, the vascularity of the capitellum is limited compared with that in adults because the physis acts as a physical barrier to vascular ingrowth from the metaphysis to the epiphysis. The necrotic subchondral bone cannot keep up with the weight-bearing demands of certain high-level athletes such as gymnasts, accumulating microfractures and eventually crumbling. Without the support of the subchondral bone, the overlying cartilage fractures and eventually comes loose, often floating around the joint as a loose body. Fibrocartilage may form to fill the void left behind but cannot restore either the structural integrity of the bone or the gliding and compressive properties of hyaline cartilage. Replacement of both the bone and the cartilage requires an osteochondral transplant. Fortunately, there are regions of the articular surface of the knee in which there is minimal load or contact and that are therefore expendable as donor osteochondral plugs. We prefer a single-plug technique whenever possible because it is easier to perform and only requires union of the plug to native bone across 1 interface. If a single plug will not cover the defect or cannot be made to match the contour of the capitellum, multiple plugs may be used (i.e., mosaicplasty).Place the patient with the operative side up in the lateral decubitus position with the arm in a holder. First, perform a diagnostic elbow arthroscopy. Use the proximal anteromedial portal to insert the scope across the front of the joint. Using a switching stick, make an anterolateral portal. Place a cannula to prevent having to go in and out of the joint multiple times, as this increases the risk of neurologic injury. Perform a synovectomy if necessary and remove any loose bodies. The absence of synovitis is a sign that the lesion has likely healed. Inspect the capitellum and radial head. The anterior margin of the OCD lesion of the capitellum will be barely visible as the joint is brought to extension.If the lesion is readily visible in the anterior compartment, the lesion will be too anterior to approach from an anconeus split approach. In this case, some have advocated a takedown of the lateral collateral ligament to aid in visualization from a lateral approach1. We have had good success with a direct anterior approach between the brachialis and brachioradialis, mobilizing the radial nerve laterally.If the chondral injury is extensive or includes the articular surface of the radial head, then the injury is too advanced to successfully treat with an OAT procedure. In these cases, we perform an interposition arthroplasty of the radiocapitellar joint. Radial head resection is not an option in a child because of the high risk of proximal radial migration. Radial head replacement likewise is not an option because of the high risk of failure.Switch the viewing and working portals again with use of switching sticks and repeat the process for the medial side of the joint. Make a direct posterior and a proximal posterolateral portal. Never debride on or near the medial gutter because the ulnar nerve is immediately adjacent. Establish a soft spot portal and place the scope through it. Loose bodies and extensive synovitis are typically seen in this area when the soft spot portal is used as a viewing portal. The OCD lesion should be visible through the soft spot portal. If the lesion is not readily visible with some elbow flexion, then the lesion is probably too anterior for an anconeus split approach and an anterior approach should be considered.Challenge the lesion with a probe. If the cartilage is damaged but the subchondral bone holds firm, perform a microfracture technique. If the cartilage is soft or unstable and the underlying bone is compromised, perform an OAT procedure. In the majority of cases in which the lesion is accessible posteriorly, connect the proximal posterolateral portal and the soft spot portal and split the anconeus. The lesion will be visible in deep flexion. There are several options for instrumentation from multiple manufacturers that each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Using a recipient harvester, remove the diseased bone and cartilage to a stable rim, keeping the harvester as perpendicular to the surface as possible.At the knee, make a 3-cm transverse incision directly over the superolateral corner of the lateral femoral condyle. Harvest an appropriately sized plug from the superolateral corner of the articular surface. Inspect the plug because it will often be slightly thicker on one side. Rotate the plug to match the contour of the defect in the capitellum. Mallet the donor plug into the recipient deficit with gentle taps, using as few taps as possible to limit chondrocyte injury. Fill the defect in the knee with your choice of bone substitute. Close both wounds in layers.Other options include allograft plugs, periosteal resurfacing, bone grafting, retrograde and antegrade drilling, and observation.The OCD lesion involves both bone and cartilage. There is now ample evidence that replacing both as a unit yields the best outcomes.Approximately 90% of patients will return to sports participation, and 80% of patients can expect to return to sport at their previous level of participation1-3.A diagnostic arthroscopy confirms the need for the OAT procedure and identifies other pathologies.Remove all of the diseased bone with the recipient harvester.Match the size and contour of the lesion as closely as possible with the plug.Immobilize the elbow in a cast for 4 weeks.",0

Exclusion criteria included meniscus transplantation, realignment osteotomy, or other ligamentous injury. Complications, reoperations, and patient responses to validated outcome measures were reviewed. Failure was defined by any procedure involving allograft removal/revision or conversion to arthroplasty. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression were performed to evaluate the association of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with failure.A total of 50 ACL-intact and 25 ACL-reconstructed (18 prior, 7 concomitant) OCA patients were analyzed. The mean age was 36.2 years (range, 14-62 years). Mean follow-up was 3.9 years (range, 2-14 years). Patient demographics and chondral lesion characteristics were similar between groups. ACL-reconstructed patients averaged 2.2 ± 1.9 prior surgeries on the ipsilateral knee compared with 1.4 ± 1.4 surgeries for ACL-intact patients (P = .014). Grafts used for the last ACLR included bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, hamstring autograft, Achilles tendon allograft, and tibialis allograft (data available for only 11 of 25 patients). At final follow-up, 22% of ACL-intact and 32% of ACL-reconstructed patients had undergone reoperation. OCA survivorship was 90% and 96% at 2 years and 79% and 85% at 5 years in ACL-intact and ACL-reconstructed patients, respectively (P = .774). ACLR was not independently associated with failure. Both groups demonstrated clinically significant improvements in the Short Form-36 pain and physical functioning, International Knee Documentation Committee subjective, and Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living scores at final follow-up (P < .001), with no significant differences in preoperative, postoperative, and change scores between groups.OCA in the setting of prior or concomitant ACLR does not portend higher failure rates or compromise clinical outcomes.Level III, retrospective comparative study.",0

A secondary objective was to identify salient demographic factors associated with these procedures.We performed a retrospective database review using a large private-payer medical record database within the PearlDiver database. The PearlDiver database is a publicly available, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant national database compiled from a collection of private insurer records. A search was performed for surgical techniques in cartilage palliation (chondroplasty), repair (microfracture/drilling), and restoration (arthroscopic osteochondral autograft, arthroscopic osteochondral allograft, autologous chondrocyte implantation, open osteochondral allograft, and open osteochondral autograft). The incidence, growth, and demographic factors associated with the surgical procedures were assessed.From 2004 through 2011, 198,876,000 patients were analyzed. A surgical procedure addressing a cartilage defect was performed in 1,959,007 patients, for a mean annual incidence of 90 surgeries per 10,000 patients. Across all cartilage procedures, there was a 5.0% annual incidence growth (palliative, 3.7%; repair, 0%; and restorative, 3.1%) (P = .027). Palliative techniques (chondroplasty) were more common (>2:1 ratio for repair [marrow-stimulation techniques] and 50:1 ratio for restoration [autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral autograft and allograft]). Palliative surgical approaches were the most common technique, regardless of age, sex, or region.Articular cartilage surgical procedures in the knee are common in the United States, with an annual incidence growth of 5%. Surgical techniques aimed at palliation are more common than cartilage repair and restoration techniques regardless of age, sex, or region.Level IV, retrospective database analysis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4007748,Computational Investigation of Fibrin Mechanical and Damage Properties at the Interface Between Native Cartilage and Implant,"Scaffold-based tissue-engineered constructs as well as cell-free implants offer promising solutions to focal cartilage lesions. However, adequate mechanical stability of these implants in the lesion is required for successful repair. Fibrin is the most common clinically available adhesive for cartilage implant fixation, but fixation quality using fibrin is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to investigate the conditions leading to damage in the fibrin adhesive and to determine which adhesive properties are important in preventing delamination at the interface. An idealized finite element model of the medial compartment of the knee was created, including a circular defect and an osteochondral implant. Damage and failure of fibrin at the interface was represented by a cohesive zone model with coefficients determined from an inverse finite element method and previously published experimental data. Our results demonstrated that fibrin glue alone may not be strong enough to withstand physiologic loads in vivo while fibrin glue combined with chondrocytes more effectively prevents damage at the interface. The results of this study suggest that fibrin fails mainly in shear during off-axis loading and that adhesive materials that are stronger or more compliant than fibrin may be good alternatives due to decreased failure at the interface. The present model may be used to improve design and testing protocols of bioadhesives and give insight into the failure mechanisms of cartilage implant fixation in the knee joint.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10123536,Restoring Osteochondral Defects through the Differentiation Potential of Cartilage Stem/Progenitor Cells Cultivated on Porous Scaffolds,"Cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs) are cartilage-specific, multipotent progenitor cells residing in articular cartilage. In this study, we investigated the characteristics and potential of human CSPCs combined with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds to induce osteochondral regeneration in rabbit knees. We isolated CSPCs from human adult articular cartilage undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. We characterized CSPCs and compared them with infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (IFPs) in a colony formation assay and by multilineage differentiation analysis in vitro. We further evaluated the osteochondral regeneration of the CSPC-loaded PLGA scaffold during osteochondral defect repair in rabbits. The characteristics of CSPCs were similar to those of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and exhibited chondrogenic and osteogenic phenotypes without chemical induction. For in vivo analysis, CSPC-loaded PLGA scaffolds produced a hyaline-like cartilaginous tissue, which showed good integration with the host tissue and subchondral bone. Furthermore, CSPCs migrated in response to injury to promote subchondral bone regeneration. Overall, we demonstrated that CSPCs can promote osteochondral regeneration. A monophasic approach of using diseased CSPCs combined with a PLGA scaffold may be beneficial for repairing complex tissues, such as osteochondral tissue.",0
https://doi.org/10.52198/21.sti.38.os1384,Patient-Specific Implants for Focal Cartilage Lesions in The Knee: Implant Survivorship Analysis up to Seven Years Post-Implantation,"In the quest for increased surgical precision and improved joint kinematics, Computer-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery (CAOS) shows promising results for both total and partial joint replacement. In the knee, computer-assisted joint design can now be applied to the treatment of younger patients suffering pain and restriction of activity due to focal defects in their femoral articular cartilage. By taking MRI scans of the affected knee and digitally segmenting these scans, we can identify and map focal defects in cartilage and bone. Metallic implants matched to the defect can be fabricated, and guide instrumentation to ensure proper implant alignment and depth of recession in the surrounding cartilage can be designed from segmented MRI scans. Beginning in 2012, a series of 682 patient-specific implants were designed based on MRI analysis of femoral cartilage focal defects, and implanted in 612 knees. A Kaplan-Meier analysis found a cumulative survivorship of 96% at 7-year follow-up from the first implantation. Fourteen (2.3%) of these implants required revision due to disease progression, incorrect implant positioning, and inadequate lesion coverage at the time of surgery. These survivorship data compare favorably with all other modes of treatment for femoral focal cartilage lesions and support the use of patient-specific implants designed from segmented MRI scans in these cases.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2015.0510,Expandable Scaffold Improves Integration of Tissue-Engineered Cartilage: An <i>In Vivo</i> Study in a Rabbit Model,"One of the major limitations of tissue-engineered cartilage is poor integration of chondrocytes and scaffold structures with recipient tissue. To overcome this limitation, an expandable scaffold with a honeycomb-like structure has been developed using microfluidic technology. In this study, we evaluated the performance of this expandable gelatin scaffold seeded with rabbit chondrocytes in vivo. The chondrocyte/scaffold constructs were implanted into regions of surgically introduced cylindrical osteochondral defects in rabbit femoral condyles. At 2, 4, and 6 months postsurgery, the implanted constructs were evaluated by gross and histological examinations. As expected, the osteochondral defects, which were untreated or transplanted with blank scaffolds, showed no signs of repair, whereas the defects transplanted with chondrocyte/scaffold constructs showed significant cartilage regeneration. Furthermore, the expandable scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes had more regenerated cartilage tissue and better integration with the recipient tissue than autologous chondrocyte implantation. Biomechanical tests revealed that the chondrocyte/scaffold group had the highest compressive strength among all groups at all three time points and endured a similar compressive force to normal cartilage after 6 months of implantation. Histological examinations revealed that the chondrocytes were distributed uniformly within the scaffolds, maintained a normal phenotype, and secreted functional components of the extracellular matrix. Histomorphometric assessment showed a remarkable total interface of up to 87% integration of the expandable scaffolds with the host tissue at 6 months postoperation. In conclusion, the expandable scaffolds improved chondrocyte/scaffold construct integration with the host tissue and were beneficial for cartilage repair.",0

We present the short-term clinical outcome and MRI findings of a cell-free scaffold used for the treatment of these lesions in the knee. A total of 38 patients were prospectively evaluated clinically for two years following treatment with an osteochondral nanostructured biomimetic scaffold. There were 23 men and 15 women; the mean age of the patients was 30.5 years (15 to 64). Clinical outcome was assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Tegner activity scale and a Visual Analgue scale for pain. MRI data were analysed based on the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring system at three, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. There was a continuous significant clinical improvement after surgery. In two patients, the scaffold treatment failed (5.3%) There was a statistically significant improvement in the MOCART precentage scores. The repair tissue filled most of the defect sufficiently. We found subchondral laminar changes in all patients. Intralesional osteophytes were found in two patients (5.3%). We conclude that this one-step scaffold-based technique can be used for osteochondral repair. The surgical technique is straightforward, and the clinical results are promising. The MRI aspects of the repair tissue continue to evolve during the first two years after surgery. However, the subchondral laminar and bone changes are a concern.

Consequently, the surgical technique advanced to use a porcine-derived bilayer of type I/III collagen with a porous layer that favors cell attachment and a smooth, compact layer that is cell occlusive. In use of the collagen membrane ACI, prospective studies have shown no diminution in clinical results and a marked reduction in subsequent surgeries from graft hypertrophy to <3%.

Orthobiologics used for cartilage defects include (but are not limited to) bone marrow aspirate concentrate, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, platelet-rich plasma, and micronized allogeneic cartilage. Each of these products can be applied in the clinical setting, as an isolated surgical procedure, or as an augment to cartilage restoration surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.h.01390,Current and Novel Approaches to Treating Chondral Lesions,"Total joint arthroplasty remains the most effective treatment to relieve pain and restore function in damaged and diseased joints; however, less invasive, more functional solutions are necessary for young, active patients who have chondral defects and are at the early stages of disease. Unfortunately, attempts at providing such a method have provided variable and often unsatisfactory outcomes. Unicondylar knee replacement, for example, is associated with a markedly higher rate of revision when compared with total knee arthroplasty, and there is a distinct probability of disease progression in the remaining joint compartments. Small metallic caps intended for filling the cartilage defects are commercially available, but the clinical follow-up of patients who have undergone this treatment is short. Although not yet in clinical use, synthetic polymeric implant scaffolds, with and without cell-seeding, are also under development. The biomechanical requirements for treating chondral lesions, like those of total knee arthroplasty, are wear and fixation. A lesion-filling implant must carry large joint loads without damaging the opposing tissue. Integration with surrounding cartilage and subchondral bone would enhance load-sharing and load transfer. The challenge of meeting these requirements is difficult, but new forms of computational models and in vitro tests can aid in establishing performance and in rapidly screening possible solutions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0351,Repair of Large Animal Partial-Thickness Cartilage Defects Through Intraarticular Injection of Matrix-Rejuvenated Synovium-Derived Stem Cells,"Cartilage defects have a limited ability to self-heal. Stem cell treatment is a promising approach; however, replicative senescence is a challenge to acquiring large-quantity and high-quality stem cells for cartilage regeneration. Synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs) are a tissue-specific stem cell for cartilage regeneration. Our recent findings suggest that decellularized stem cell matrix (DSCM) can rejuvenate expanded SDSCs in cell proliferation and chondrogenic potential. In this study, we were investigating (1) whether transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β3 played a similar role in chondrogenic induction of SDSCs after expansion on either DSCM or plastic flasks (plastic), and (2) whether DSCM-expanded SDSCs had an enhanced capacity in repairing partial-thickness cartilage defects in a minipig model. SDSCs were isolated from synovium in two 3-month-old pigs and DSCM was prepared using SDSCs. Passage 2 SDSCs were expanded on either DSCM or plastic for one passage. The expanded cells were evaluated for cell morphology, chondrogenic capacity, and related mechanisms. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were compared for their role in chondrogenesis of SDSCs after expansion on either DSCM or plastic. The chondrogenic induction medium without TGF-β served as a control. In 13 minipigs, we intraarticularly injected DSCM- or plastic-expanded SDSCs or saline into knee partial-thickness cartilage defects and assessed their repair using histology and immunohistochemistry. We found DSCM-expanded SDSCs were small, had a fibroblast-like shape, and grew quickly in a three-dimensional format with concomitant up-regulation of phosphocyclin D1 and TGF-β receptor II. Plastic-expanded SDSCs exhibited higher mRNA levels of chondrogenic markers when incubated with TGF-β3, while DSCM-expanded SDSCs displayed comparable chondrogenic potential when treated with either TGF-β isotype. In the minipig model, DSCM-expanded SDSCs were better than plastic-expanded SDSCs in enhancing collagen II and sulfated glycosaminoglycan expression in repair of partial-thickness cartilage defects, but both groups were superior to the saline control group. Our observations suggested that DSCM is a promising cell expansion system that can promote cell proliferation and enhance expanded cell chondrogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. Our approach could lead to a tissue-specific cell expansion system providing large-quantity and high-quality stem cells for the treatment of cartilage defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-3262-7_6,Enhancing Osteochondral Tissue Regeneration of Gellan Gum by Incorporating Gallus gallus var Domesticus-Derived Demineralized Bone Particle,"Treatment for the osteochondral defects (ODs) is more challenging nowadays that needs to be addressed by developing alternative bone tissue engineering materials. Gellan gum (GG) is a widely used natural polysaccharide in the field of tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine due to its versatile properties. There are many reports about the successful application of GG in cartilage tissue engineering and guiding bone formation. Functional coatings and porous composite materials have been introduced in next-generation materials for treating OD, whereas osteoconductive materials, such as demineralized bone particle (DBP) or bone derivatives, are used. However, modification of porosity, biocompatibility, cell proliferation, and mechanical properties is needed. DBP can activate human mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblast cells. In this chapter, the potential application of GG with DBP in different combinations was reviewed, and the best suitable combinations were selected and further studied in small animal models for the soft and hard tissue engineering applications; also its application in the osteochondral integration fields were briefly discussed.",0
,[Autologous osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) in the treatment of femoral condyle defects].,"Adult articular cartilage lacks the capacity for self-repair. Cartilage defects change articular biomechanics and lead to eventual osteoarthritis and joint destruction. During the past decade, several competing techniques have evolved to stimulate articular cartilage repair. Micro-fracture can successfully treat small lesions of non weigh-bearing surfaces. When the damaged area is more extensive, osteochondral cylinder grafting (mosaicplasty) should be considered. Our experience includes 5 cases with follow-up of 6 months to 1 year. Between 1999 and 2000 an osteochondral transplantation (mosaicplasty) was performed in 5 patients. The defect-size in these 5 patients (2 males and 3 females) ranged between 12 mm and 23 mm in diameter and had an average-size of 15 mm. In the all of cases an average of 7.2 grafts was needed. Preoperative complaints of pain, crepitation and locking disappear. The short outcome in the modified HSS-score has shown excellent and good results. The average score value during follow-up was 93.8 (range 92-96). This outcome forms prerequisite for likewise middle-term-results. Mosaicplasty can be recommended for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects in the weight-bearing area of the knee as a safe procedure for transplantation of hyaline cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00132-011-1776-8,Therapie lokaler Knorpelschäden im Patellofemoralgelenk,"Cartilage defects of the patellofemoral joint represent different entities. Results of patellofemoral cartilage repair are often variable. Concomitant pathologies, such as malalignment and instability are frequent. Currently no common treatment concept exists. Improvement of patellofemoral biomechanics, e.g. tubercle transfer, results in better outcome independent of the cartilage repair technique used. In patellofemoral instability reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) has recently become a focus of interest. Microfracturing and osteochondral cylinder transfer/mosaicplasty are recommended for smaller defects, while comparative studies have shown advantages for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in defects larger than 4 cm². In our study patients with patellofemoral scaffold ACI (MACI®), better Lysholm scores were seen with isolated trochlea defects rather than patella defects or bipolar lesions. While trochlea defects can be effectively addressed, treatment of bipolar patellofemoral defects by scaffold ACI cannot generally be recommended. Follow-up treatment of the patellofemoral joint is more time and cost-consuming than other defect localizations. For the development of therapeutic algorithms further well-defined large randomized studies are necessary.",0

At 12 months, goats were euthanized and MRI was performed. Two blinded radiologists independently rated nine primary features for each graft, including cartilage signal, fill, edge integration, surface congruity, calcified cartilage integrity, subchondral bone plate congruity, subchondral bone marrow signal, osseous integration, and presence of cystic changes. Four ancillary features of the joint were also evaluated, including opposing cartilage, meniscal tears, synovitis, and fat-pad scarring. Comparison was made with histological and μCT reference standards as well as biomechanical measures. Interobserver agreement and agreement with reference standards was assessed. Cohen's kappa, Spearman's correlation, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate.There was substantial agreement (κ>0.6, p<0.001) for each MRI feature and with comparison against reference standards, except for cartilage edge integration (κ=0.6). There was a strong positive correlation between MRI and reference standard scores (ρ=0.86, p<0.01). OCAMRISS was sensitive to differences in outcomes between the types of allografts.We have described a comprehensive MRI scoring system for osteochondral allografts and have validated this scoring system with histopathologic and μCT reference standards as well as biomechanical indentation testing.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546517724761,A Comparison of 2-Year Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Tibiofemoral or Patellofemoral Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) has demonstrated encouraging clinical results in the treatment of knee chondral defects. However, earlier studies suggested that chondrocyte implantation in the patellofemoral (PF) joint was less effective than in the tibiofemoral (TF) joint. Purpose: To compare the radiological and clinical outcomes of those undergoing MACI to either the femoral condyles or PF joint. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 194 patients were included in this analysis, including 127 undergoing MACI to the medial (n = 94) and lateral (n = 33) femoral condyle, as well as 67 to the patella (n = 35) or trochlea (n = 32). All patients were evaluated clinically (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], visual analog scale, Short Form–36) before surgery and at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken at 3, 12, and 24 months, with the MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scoring system employed to evaluate the quality and quantity of repair tissue, as well as an MRI composite score. Patient satisfaction was evaluated. Results: No significant group differences ( P &gt; .05) were seen in demographics, defect size, prior injury, or surgical history, while the majority of clinical scores were similar preoperatively. All clinical scores significantly improved over time ( P &lt; .05), with a significant group effect observed for KOOS activities of daily living ( P = .008), quality of life ( P = .008), and sport ( P = .017), reflecting better postoperative scores in the TF group. While the PF group had significantly lower values at baseline for the KOOS activities of daily living and quality of life subscales, it actually displayed a similar net improvement over time compared with the TF group. At 24 months, 93.7% (n = 119) and 91.0% (n = 61) of patients were satisfied with the ability of MACI to relieve their knee pain, 74.0% (n = 94) and 65.7% (n = 44) with their ability to participate in sport, and 90.5% (n = 115) and 83.6% (n = 56) satisfied overall, in the TF and PF groups, respectively. MRI evaluation via the MOCART score revealed a significant time effect ( P &lt; .05) for the MRI composite score and graft infill over the 24-month period. While subchondral lamina scored significantly better ( P = .002) in the TF group, subchondral bone scored significantly worse ( P &lt; .001). At 24 months, the overall MRI composite score was classified as good/excellent in 98 TF patients (77%) and 54 PF patients (81%). Conclusion: MACI in the PF joint with concurrent correction of PF maltracking if required leads to similar clinical and radiological outcomes compared with MACI on the femoral condyles.",1
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.i.00895,Management of Articular Cartilage Defects of the Knee,"Articular cartilage has a poor intrinsic capacity for healing. The goal of surgical techniques to repair articular cartilage injuries is to achieve the regeneration of organized hyaline cartilage. Microfracture and other bone marrow stimulation techniques involve penetration of the subchondral plate in order to recruit mesenchymal stem cells into the chondral defect. The formation of a stable clot that fills the lesion is of paramount importance to achieve a successful outcome. Mosaicplasty is a viable option with which to address osteochondral lesions of the knee and offers the advantage of transplanting hyaline cartilage. However, limited graft availability and donor site morbidity are concerns. Transplantation of an osteochondral allograft consisting of intact, viable articular cartilage and its underlying subchondral bone offers the ability to address large osteochondral defects of the knee, including those involving an entire compartment. The primary theoretical advantage of autologous chondrocyte implantation is the development of hyaline-like cartilage rather than fibrocartilage in the defect, which presumably leads to better long-term outcomes and longevity of the healing tissue. Use of synthetic scaffolds is a potentially attractive alternative to traditional cartilage procedures as they are readily available and, unlike allogeneic tissue transplants, are associated with no risk of disease transmission. Their efficacy, however, has not been proven clinically.",0

Most studies on surgical procedures for cartilage focus on young patients because these procedures are generally not considered suitable for older patients.To analyze the clinical outcome of cartilage lesion treatment using second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) techniques in patients more than 40 years old with no clear signs of osteoarthritis, to understand their real potential in relation to aging, the failure rate, and complications in older patients.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Sixty-one patients with grade III to IV cartilaginous lesions of the condyles with no clear signs of osteoarthritis and a minimum age of 40 years were treated with second-generation ACI and prospectively evaluated at 5 years' follow-up. Twenty-two patients were treated with arthroscopic Hyalograft C implantation, and 39 underwent the open Chondro-Gide MACI procedure.A significant improvement in both subjective and objective evaluations was observed. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score improved from 36.8 ± 8.4 to 68.1 ± 21.8 at the final evaluation. The failure rate was 20%. A faster improvement was observed in the group treated with the arthroscopic Hyalograft C technique, whereas similar scores were found at the 24-month follow-up and final evaluation.A clinical improvement was found in patients more than 40 years old, who in most cases benefited from second-generation ACI with good results lasting at medium-term follow-up. However, the results were inferior with respect to those previously found for younger populations, and the failure rate at medium-term follow-up was also higher. These findings were consistent in the 2 treatment groups. The only difference was the faster recovery when the arthroscopic approach was used.",0
https://doi.org/10.1053/j.otsm.2013.03.008,BioCartilage: Background and Operative Technique,"Damage to articular cartilage is prevalent and causes significant morbidity. A common initial treatment for focal, full-thickness articular cartilage defects is microfracture, which has been shown to have good to excellent short-term outcomes in appropriately indicated patients. Unfortunately, microfracture leads to the growth of fibrocartilage repair tissue rather than native hyaline-like cartilage and is less durable at longer-term follow-up. Efforts to augment repair and restore hyaline-like cartilage have led to the use of 2-stage procedures, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, allografts, harvesting of autograft tissue, or complex scaffolds. An effective and reliable simple, single-stage method of cartilage restoration is needed. BioCartilageTM is a new product containing dehydrated, micronized allogeneic cartilage and is implanted with the addition of platelet rich plasma over a microfractured defect. Platelet rich plasma is shown to potentiate the cartilage repair process and is chemotactic for mesenchymal stem cells introduced following the microfracture procedure. BioCartilageTM is also an appropriate allogeneic cartilage scaffold with the proper biochemical makeup, including Collagen Type II and cartilage matrix elements. The procedure can be performed as a single-stage procedure with instrumentation and skill level consistent with standard microfracture techniques. The use of BioCartilage may create more hyaline-like tissue at the repair site vs microfracture alone.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546511422220,Five-Year Outcome of Characterized Chondrocyte Implantation Versus Microfracture for Symptomatic Cartilage Defects of the Knee,"Background: Characterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI) results in significantly better early structural tissue regeneration than microfracture (MF), and CCI has a midterm clinical benefit over microfracture. Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate the 5-year clinical outcome of CCI in a randomized comparison with MF for the treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyles of the knee. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Participants aged 18 to 50 years with a symptomatic isolated International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III or IV cartilage lesion of the femoral condyles between 1 and 5 cm 2 were randomized to either CCI or MF. Clinical outcomes were measured up to 60 months after surgery using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The main outcome parameter was change from baseline in overall KOOS (oKOOS). Adverse events were monitored. Results: Fifty-one participants were treated with CCI and 61 with MF. On average, clinical benefit was maintained through the 60-month follow-up period. The average change from baseline in oKOOS was not different between both groups (least squares [LS] mean ± standard error [SE] 18.84 ± 3.58 for CCI vs 13.21 ± 5.63 for MF; P = .116). Treatment failures were comparable (n = 7 in CCI vs n = 10 in MF), although MF failures tended to occur earlier. Subgroup analysis revealed that CCI resulted in better outcome in participants with time since symptom onset of less than 3 years, which was statistically significant and clinically relevant (change in oKOOS &lt;3 years mean ± SE 25.96 ± 3.45 for CCI vs 15.28 ± 3.17 for MF; P = .026 vs oKOOS &gt;3 years mean ± SE 13.09 ± 4.78 for CCI vs 17.02 ± 4.50 for MF, P = .554). Other subgroup analyses such as age (cutoff 35 years) did not show a difference. Female patients showed more failures irrespective of treatment. Conclusion: At 5 years after treatment, clinical outcomes for CCI and MF were comparable. In the early treatment group, CCI obtained statistically significant and clinically relevant better results than MF. Delayed treatment resulted in less predictable outcomes for CCI. These results provide strong evidence that time since onset of symptoms is an essential variable that should be taken into account in future treatment algorithms for cartilage repair of the knee.",1

However, breaching of the subchondral bone plate could compromise the subchondral bone structure.Microfracture and AMIC will cause deleterious effects on the subchondral bone structure.Controlled laboratory study.A total of 36 sheep received an 8-mm-diameter cartilage defect in the left medial femoral condyle. Control animals (n = 12) received no further treatment, and the rest received 5 microfracture holes either with a type I/III collagen scaffold implanted (n = 12; AMIC group) or without the collagen scaffold (n = 12; microfracture group). Macroscopic infill of defects, histology, and histomorphometry of the subchondral bone were performed at 13 and 26 weeks postoperatively, and micro-computed tomography (CT) was also performed at 26 weeks postoperatively.Microfracture and AMIC resulted in subchondral bone cyst formation in 5 of 12 (42%) and 11 of 12 (92%) specimens at 13 and 26 weeks, respectively. Subchondral bone changes induced by microfracture and AMIC were characterized by an increased percentage of bone volume, increased trabecular thickness, and a decreased trabecular separation, and extended beyond the area below the defect. High numbers of osteoclasts were observed at the cyst periphery, and all cysts communicated with the microfracture holes. Cartilage repair tissue was of poor quality and quantity at both time points and rarely reached the tidemark at 13 weeks.Microfracture technique caused bone cyst formation and induced severe pathology of the subchondral bone in a sheep model.The potential of microfracture technique to induce subchondral bone pathology should be considered.",0

However, little is known about how graft maturation is affected by characteristics of transplanted chondrocytes. Purpose: To investigate the influence of gene expression of chondrocytes at the time of transplantation on MRI outcomes up to 2 years after MACT. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This study included 25 patients with 27 symptomatic traumatic defects of articular cartilage, who had undergone MACT in the knee. Postoperative MRI examinations were conducted at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Biochemical graft maturation was assessed by measuring T2 relaxation time values of the transplant and healthy native cartilage areas. The MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score was used to evaluate the morphological quality of regeneration tissue. Gene expression (collagen type I, collagen type II, aggrecan, versican, and interleukin-1β) was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in transplant residuals at the time point of transplantation and was correlated with MRI outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. A Friedman test with post hoc analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) conducted with a Bonferroni correction was applied to compare scores at different time points. Results: T2 relaxation time of regeneration tissue improved from a mean ± SD of 74.6 ± 20.1 milliseconds at 3 months to 47.9 ±13.3 milliseconds at 24 months ( P &lt; .003). These values were similar to the T2 relaxation times of the native surrounding cartilage (50.9 ± 15 ms). The calculated T2 index (ratio of regeneration tissue to native cartilage) improved from 1.63 ± 0.76 at 3 months to 1.0 ± 0.4 at 24 months ( P &lt; .011). The MOCART score increased from 51.6 ± 15 points to 72.4 ± 12.2 points ( P &lt; .001). Improvement of the T2 index over time significantly correlated with aggrecan, COL1A1, COL2A1, and versican expression ( r s = 0.9, P &lt; .001; r s = 0.674, P &lt; .012; r s = 0.553, P &lt; .05; and r s = 0.575, P &lt; .04, respectively). No correlation was found for IL-1β. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that matrix production in transplanted chondrocytes affects maturation of MACT grafts in MRI 2 years after surgery.",0

Medial femoral condyle defect was created in both knees of twenty-four mature New Zealand white rabbits, and the animals were divided into four groups containing six animals each. After 3 weeks, the right knees were transplanted with PVA-chitosan-MSC, PVA-chitosan scaffold alone, alginate-MSC construct or alginate alone. The left knee was kept as untreated control. Animals were killed at the end of 6 months after transplantation, and the cartilage repair was assessed through Brittberg morphological score, histological grading by O'Driscoll score and quantitative glycosaminoglycan analysis. Morphological and histological analyses showed significant (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) tissue repair when treated with PVA-chitosan-MSC or alginate MSC as compared to the scaffold only and untreated control. In addition, safranin O staining and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content were significantly higher (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) in MSC treatment groups than in scaffold-only or untreated control group. No significant difference was observed between the PVA-chitosan-MSC- and alginate-MSC-treated groups. PVA-chitosan hydrogel seeded with mesenchymal stem cells provides comparable treatment outcomes to that of previously established alginate-MSC construct implantation. This study supports the potential use of PVA-chitosan hydrogel seeded with MSCs for clinical use in cartilage repair such as traumatic injuries.",0

Despite the limited healing potential of chondral defects, several treatment options have been proposed. However, microfracture, osteochondral autograft (or allograft) transfer, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation are all associated with their respective shortcomings. As such, the optimal treatment for chondral defects of the knee remains unclear. Recently, many authors have advocated treating chondral defects with biological therapies and scaffold-based treatments. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate, a cell-based injection, has gained particular attention because of its differentiation capacity and potential role in tissue regeneration. In addition, scaffold cartilage treatments have emerged and reached clinical practice. BioCartilage is one form of scaffold, which consists of extracellular matrix, and has been claimed to promote the regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage.

Osteochondral transplantation for these defects has become a more common procedure. However, long-term results are unknown. Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate long-term clinical and radiologic outcomes of advanced osteochondral lesions in the elbow treated with osteochondral transplantation. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: The study included 8 patients with osteochondral lesions in the elbow who were treated by autologous osteochondral transplantation between 1996 and 2002. Patients (average age, 17 years) were evaluated pre- and postoperatively by Broberg-Morrey score to assess elbow function and by American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score for pain analysis. In addition, radiographs (at the first postoperative day, and at 5-year and 10-year follow-up) and magnetic resonance images (8 to 12 weeks postoperatively, and at 5-year and 10-year follow-up) were made to evaluate the joint status. At last follow-up (range, 8-14 years postoperatively), 7 of 8 patients were seen for clinical examination and radiologic analysis. Results: The Broberg-Morrey score increased from an average of 75.9 ± 13.1 to 96.4 ± 2.4 and ASES score significantly improved as follows: worst pain, 7.9 ± 1.1 to 1.6 ± 1.9; rest pain, 3.14 ± 2.7 to 0.6 ± 1.5; weight-lifting pain, 7.6 ± 0.8 to 3.1 ± 1.6; and repetitive movement pain, 5.3 ± 2.4 to 1.6 ± 1.5. Compared with the contralateral side, there was a mean preoperative flexion lag of 12.5° ± 11.6°. At the final follow-up, flexion was free. The mean extension lag was reduced from average 5.4° ± 5.7° to 0°. Radiographs of 2 patients made at final follow-up showed mild signs of osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence grade I). Postoperative magnetic resonance images showed graft viability in all and a congruent chondral surface in 6 of 7 patients. Conclusion: Clinical long-term results after osteochondral transplantation in the elbow are good to excellent and comparable with midterm results in the literature. Therefore, this technique is a reliable option for satisfactory long-term results regarding treatment of advanced osteochondral lesions in the elbow.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546513495637,Accelerated Weightbearing Rehabilitation After Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation in the Tibiofemoral Joint,"Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) has become an established technique for the repair of full-thickness chondral defects in the knee, although best patient outcomes appear limited by a lack of evidence-based knowledge on how to progressively increase postoperative weightbearing (WB) and rehabilitation exercises.To determine the safety and efficacy of an accelerated WB regimen after MACI in the tibiofemoral joint.Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Clinical and radiological assessments were performed in 28 knees at 12 months after MACI to the medial or lateral femoral condyle. Both rehabilitation interventions sought to protect the implant for an initial period and then incrementally increase load bearing. Under the ""accelerated"" (AR) protocol, patients reached full WB at 6 weeks after surgery compared with 8 weeks for what was considered to be the current ""best practice"" (CR) WB regimen based on previous research. Assessments included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), visual analog scale, 6-minute walk test, and active knee range of motion (ROM). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to describe the quality and quantity of repair tissue via the assessment of pertinent parameters of graft repair as well as an MRI composite score.Patients in both groups demonstrated significant improvement (P < .05) in all clinical measures over the preoperative and postoperative timeline from before surgery to 12 months after surgery. The AR group reported significantly better (P < .05) SF-36 physical component scores at 8 weeks and significantly greater (P < .05) KOOS quality of life scores at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Although no differences (P > .05) were observed between the 2 groups for active knee ROM, the AR group did achieve full active knee extension as early as 4 weeks compared with the CR group at 12 weeks. There was no difference (P > .05) in graft quality as assessed by MRI (MOCART composite score: AR, 3.34; CR, 3.04), with no patients suffering any adverse effects from the implant up to 12 months, regardless of the rehabilitation protocol employed.The AR approach that reduced the length of time spent ambulating on crutches resulted in improved general physical function and quality of life and an earlier attainment of full active knee extension when compared with the CR approach. There were no graft complications ascertained through MRI. This regimen appears safe and may potentially speed up the recovery of normal gait function. A larger patient cohort and follow-up are required to observe long-term graft outcomes.",1

Rising health awareness, increasingly active populations and improvements in medical techniques have increased the application of cartilage regenerative minimally invasive approaches for glenohumeral joint preservation or delayed prosthetic replacement. In contrast to the conclusive and mostly convincing mid-term results of cartilage regenerative techniques known for the knee, clinical results of innovative therapeutic approaches with glenohumeral cartilage defects are more or less absent. Current techniques include procedures for mesenchymal stem cell recruitment, such as microfracturing, (autologous) osteochondral transplantation, (matrix-associated) autologous chondrocyte transplantation and biological resurfacing, addressing focal chondral defects up to massive structural osteochondral defects. With increasing arthroscopic applicability, they evolve to important tools in the armamentarium of the shoulder surgeon. Future clinical data will determine evidence-based applicability, enabling standardized treatment selection.",0

Full-thickness cartilage defects were created in the medial femoral condyle on both knees of 36 New Zealand white rabbits. The 72 defects were randomly assigned to be repaired with ipsilateral iliac crest cartilage (Group I), osteochondral tissues removed at defect creation (Group II), or no treatment (negative control, Group III). Animals were killed at 6, 12, and 24 weeks post-operatively. The repaired tissues were harvested for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological studies (haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining), and mechanical testing. At 6 weeks, the iliac crest cartilage graft was not yet well integrated with the surrounding articular cartilage, but at 12 weeks, the graft deep zone had partial ossification. By 24 weeks, the hyaline cartilage-like tissue was completely integrated with the surrounding articular cartilage. Osteochondral autografts showed more rapid healing than Group I at 6 weeks and complete healing at 12 weeks. Untreated defects were concave or partly filled with fibrous tissue throughout the study. MRI showed that Group I had slower integration with surrounding normal cartilage compared with Group II. The mechanical properties of Group I were significantly lower than those of Group II at 12 weeks, but this difference was not significant at 24 weeks. Iliac crest cartilage autografts were able to repair knee cartilage defects with hyaline cartilage and showed comparable results with osteochondral autografts in the rabbit model.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.f.00625,Fresh Stored Allografts for the Treatment of Osteochondral Defects of the Knee,"Osteochondral allograft reconstruction of articular cartilage defects is a well-established cartilage repair strategy. Currently, fresh osteochondral allograft tissue is commercially available to clinicians approximately thirty days following graft harvest. Little clinical information is available on the outcome of patients who have been treated with fresh allografts stored for several weeks or more. The purpose of this study was to prospectively analyze the clinical outcome and graft morphology of patients who received fresh, hypothermically stored, allograft tissue for the treatment of symptomatic chondral and osteochondral defects of the knee.Nineteen patients with symptomatic chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee who were treated with fresh osteochondral allografts between 1999 and 2002 were prospectively followed. The mean age at the time of surgery was thirty-four years. Validated outcomes instruments (the Activities of Daily Living Scale and the Short Form-36) were used; all patients must have had a baseline functional score prior to surgery and a minimum two-year follow-up evaluation. All grafts were obtained from commercial vendors; the mean preimplantation storage time of the graft was thirty days (range, seventeen to forty-two days). The mean lesion size was 602 mm(2). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the morphologic characteristics of the implanted grafts.The mean duration of clinical follow-up was forty-eight months (range, twenty-one to sixty-eight months). The mean score (and standard deviation) on the Activities of Daily Living Scale increased from a baseline of 56 +/- 24 to 70 +/- 22 at the time of the final follow-up (p < 0.05). The mean Short Form-36 score increased from a baseline of 51 +/- 23 to 66 +/- 24 at the time of final follow-up (p < 0.005). With the numbers studied, we could not correlate graft storage time, body mass index, lesion size, lesion location, or patient age with the functional outcome scores. At a mean follow-up interval of twenty-five months, cartilage-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the normal articular cartilage thickness was preserved in eighteen implanted grafts, and allograft cartilage signal properties were isointense relative to normal articular cartilage in eight of the eighteen grafts. Osseous trabecular incorporation of the allograft was complete or partial in fourteen patients and poor in four patients. Complete or partial trabecular incorporation positively correlated with Short Form-36 scores at the time of follow-up (r = 0.487, p < 0.05).Fresh osteochondral allografts that were hypothermically stored between seventeen and forty-two days were effective in the short term both structurally and functionally in reconstructing symptomatic chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee.Therapeutic Level IV.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of patients treated with a new all-arthroscopic AMIC® (AT-AMIC®) technique with autologous bone graft for talar osteochondral defects at a follow-up of 24 months.Twenty patients underwent the AT-AMIC® procedure and autologous bone graft for type III and IV talar osteochondral lesions. Patients were evaluated pre-operatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months post-operatively using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, the visual analog scale, and the SF-12 (Short Form-12). Radiological assessment included computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART).All scores significantly improved (p < 0.05) with respect to pre-operative values after 6 months. Further improvements were detected at 24 months (AOFAS, from 57.1 ± 14.9 before surgery to 86.6 ± 10.9 after 24 months; VAS, from 8.1 ± 1.4 to 2.5 ± 2.2; SF-12, from 29.9 ± 4.1 to 48.5 ± 6.9 and from 43.8 ± 2.9 to 53.1 ± 3.9, respectively, for Physical and Mental component score). Lesion area significantly reduced from 111.1 ± 43.2 mm2 pre-operatively to 76.9 ± 38.1 mm2 (p < 0.05) at final follow-up as assessed by CT, and from 154.1 ± 93.6 to 94.3 ± 61.3 mm2 (p < 0.05) as assessed by MRI. The mean MOCART score was 42.8 ± 23.5 points and 50.9 ± 24.9 points, respectively, at 12 and 24 months after surgery (p < 0.05).AT-AMIC® with autologous bone grafting has proven to be a safe and effective minimal invasive technique, able to rapidly and significantly improve pain, function, and radiological healing of osteochondral talar lesions, with progressive further improvements up to 24 months. Orthopedic surgeons specialized in foot and ankle surgery should adopt the AT-AMIC® technique for the treatment of osteochondral talar lesions, which proved to be effective and minimally invasive, avoiding malleolar osteotomy with a low risk of complications.IV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2018.01.049,Arthroscopic Cartilage Lesion Preparation in the Human Cadaveric Knee Using a Curette Technique Demonstrates Clinically Relevant Histologic Variation,"To examine the quality of arthroscopic cartilage debridement using a curette technique by comparing regional and morphologic variations within cartilage lesions prepared in human cadaveric knee specimens for the purpose of cartilage repair procedures. A secondary aim was to compare the histologic properties of cartilage lesions prepared by surgeons of varying experience.Standardized cartilage lesions (8 mm × 15 mm), located to the medial/lateral condyle and medial/lateral trochlea were created within 12 human cadaver knees by 40 orthopaedic surgeons. Participants were instructed to create full-thickness cartilage defects within the marked area, shouldered by uninjured vertical walls of cartilage, and to remove the calcified cartilage layer, without violating the subchondral plate. Histologic specimens were prepared to examine the verticality of surrounding cartilage walls at the front and rear aspects of the lesions, and to characterize the properties of the surrounding cartilage, the cartilage wall profile, the debrided lesion depth, bone sinusoid access, and the bone surface profile. Comparative analysis of cartilage wall verticality measured as deviation from perpendicular was performed, and Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to examine associations between debrided wall verticality and surgeon experience.Mean cartilage wall verticality relative to the base of the lesion was superior at the rear aspect of the lesion compared to the front aspect (12.9° vs 29.2°, P < .001). Variability was identified in the morphology of the surrounding cartilage (P < .001), cartilage wall profile (P = .016), debrided lesion depth (P = .028), bone surface profile (P = .040), and bone sinusoid access (P = .009), with sinusoid access identified in 42% of cases. There was no significant association of cartilage lesion wall verticality and surgeon years in practice (rs = 0.161, P = .065) or arthroscopic caseload (rs = -0.071, P = .419).Arthroscopic cartilage lesion preparation using standard curette technique in a human cadaveric knee model results in inferior perpendicularity of the surrounding cartilage walls at the front aspect of the defect, compared to the rear aspect. This technique has shown significant variability in the depth of debridement, with debridement depths identified as either too superficial or too deep to the calcified cartilage layer in more than 60% of cases in this study. Surgeon experience does not appear to impact the morphologic properties of cartilage lesions prepared arthroscopically using ring curettes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To optimize restoration of hyaline-like cartilage tissue, careful attention to prepared cartilage lesion morphology is advised when arthroscopically performing cartilage repair, given the tendency for standard curette technique to create inferior verticality of cartilage walls at the front of the lesion, and the variable depth of debridement achieved.",0

Sagittal FS PD-weighted MR images and FS 3D gradient-echo images with 1.5 T MR images were independently graded for the cartilage abnormalities of medial femoral condyle by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher's exact test. Inter-observer agreement in grading of cartilage was assessed using kappa coefficients.Arthroscopy revealed grade 3 defects in 17 patients and grade 4 defects in 4 patients in medial femoral condyles. For FS 3D gradient-echo images grade 3 defects were graded as grade 3 (n=15) and grade 4 (n=2), and all grade 4 defects (n=4) were correctly graded. However, for FS PD-weighted MR images all grade 3 defects were misinterpreted as grade 1 (n=1) and grade 4 (n=16), whereas all grade 4 defects (n=4) were correctly graded. FS 3D gradient-echo MRI could differentiate grade 3 from grade 4 defects (P=0.003), whereas FS PD-weighted imaging could not (P=1.0). Inter-observer agreement was substantial (kappa=0.70) for grading of cartilage using FS PD-weighted imaging, whereas it was moderate (kappa=0.46) using FS 3D gradient-echo imaging.FS 3D gradient-echo MRI is more helpful for differentiating between grade 3 and grade 4 cartilage defects than is FS PD-weighted imaging.",0

Purpose: To compare the midterm to long-term clinical outcomes of MFx versus ACI for focal chondral defects of the knee. Study Design: Systematic review. Methods: A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to locate studies (level of evidence I-III) comparing the minimum average 5-year clinical outcomes of patients undergoing MFx versus ACI. Search terms used were “knee,” “microfracture,” “autologous chondrocyte implantation,” and “autologous chondrocyte transplantation.” Patients were evaluated based on treatment failure rates, magnetic resonance imaging, and patient-reported outcome scores (Lysholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], and Tegner scores). Results: Five studies (3 level I evidence, 2 level II evidence) were identified that met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 210 patients (211 lesions) undergoing MFx and 189 patients (189 lesions) undergoing ACI. The average follow-up among all studies was 7.0 years. Four studies utilized first-generation, periosteum-based ACI (P-ACI), and 1 study utilized third-generation, matrix-associated ACI (M-ACI). Treatment failure occurred in 18.5% of patients undergoing ACI and 17.1% of patients undergoing MFx ( P = .70). Lysholm and KOOS scores were found to improve for both groups across studies, without a significant difference in improvement between the groups. The only significant difference in patient-reported outcome scores was found in the 1 study using M-ACI in which Tegner scores improved to a significantly greater extent in the ACI group compared with the MFx group ( P = .003). Conclusion: Patients undergoing MFx or first/third-generation ACI for articular cartilage lesions in the knee can be expected to experience improvement in clinical outcomes at midterm to long-term follow-up without any significant difference between the groups.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2018.01.019,Human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells combined with an acellular cartilage extracellular matrix scaffold improve cartilage repair compared with microfracture in a caprine model,"As a novel and promising seed cell, human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJMSCs) are widely applied in tissue engineering. However, whether hWJMSCs can better repair and regenerate the articular cartilage in big animals than microfracture (MF, a predominant clinical treatment strategy for damaged cartilage) is unclear. Evaluation of the validity, and safety of hWJMSCs in a caprine model with a full-thickness femoral condyle articular cartilage defect, compared with MF is required.After cultivation and identification, hWJMSCs were seeded in an acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM)-oriented scaffold to construct cell-scaffold complex. Six goats with full-thickness femoral condyle articular cartilage defects were randomized to MF (microfracture group, MFG) and cell-scaffold complexes (experimental group, EG). At 2 and 4 weeks, joint fluid was used to assess immuno-inflammatory responses. At 6 and 9 months, all goats were euthanized for assessment of morphology, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology staining, and evaluation of the elasticity modulus and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) contents of the repaired regions.There were no significant differences between the two groups in immuno-inflammatory parameters. MRI demonstrated higher-quality cartilage and complete subchondral bone at defect sites in the EG at 9 months. Histological staining showed that extracellular cartilage, cartilage lacuna and collagen type II levels were higher in the EG compared to the MFG, while the EG exhibited a higher elasticity modulus.The hWJMSCs-ACECM scaffold complex achieved better quality repair and regeneration of hyaline cartilage without cartilage-inducing factor, while retaining the structure and functional integrity of the subchondral bone, compared with MF.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2020.04.019,The Effect of Mechanical Leg Alignment on Cartilage Restoration With and Without Concomitant High Tibial Osteotomy,"Purpose To assess graft survivorship in patients who underwent autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) for the treatment of focal full-thickness cartilage lesions on the medial femoral condyle with and without concomitant high tibial osteotomy (HTO), depending on the preoperative lower-extremity alignment. A secondary purpose was to retrospectively evaluate associated factors for ACI and OCA graft failures. Methods A total of 168 patients who underwent cartilage repair with ACI or OCA with or without HTO for focal chondral defects on the medial femoral condyle by a single surgeon between March 2007 and February 2018 were included. Clinical notes, operative reports, and radiographic imaging were reviewed for each patient. Detailed Kaplan–Meier analyses were performed based on patient’s mechanical axis alignment. In a subanalysis, failures and nonfailures in patients treated with ACI or OCA were comparatively evaluated. Results In ACI, neutral mechanical alignment resulted in a significantly longer graft survival compared with slight valgus alignment (P = .003 and P = .05, respectively). No significant differences in survivorship were seen based on mechanical axis alignment in OCA patients (P > .05). Patients who were considered failures after ACI presented significantly more often with valgus alignment (P = .002), whereas failures in the OCA group were more often female and smokers (P = .025; P = .034). Conclusions In summary, the results of this study suggest that neutral mechanical axis alignment, regardless if physiologic or through HTO, improves survivorship in patients undergoing medial compartment ACI. Neutral alignment also showed a trend towards improved survivorship in patients after OCA, but this did not reach statistical significance. Level of Evidence Case-Series; Level of evidence, 4.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092766,The Role of Erythropoietin and Bone Marrow Concentrate in the Treatment of Osteochondral Defects in Mini-Pigs,"All available treatment options for osteochondral and chondral defects do not restore hyaline cartilage and are limited to decreasing associated pain, and maintaining or improving joint function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of erythropoietin (EPO) in combination with bone marrow aspiration concentrate (BMAC) in the treatment of osteochondral defects of mini-pigs.14 Goettinger mini-pigs, in which a 6 × 10 mm osteochondral defect in the medial femoral condyle of both knee joints was created, were randomized into four groups: biphasic scaffold alone, scaffold with EPO, scaffold with BMAC and scaffold in combination with EPO and BMAC. After 26 weeks all animals were euthanized and histological slides were evaluated using a modified ÓDriscoll Score.In the therapy groups, areas of chondrogenic tissue that contained collagen II were present. Adding EPO (p = 0.245) or BMAC (p = 0.099) alone to the scaffold led to a non-significant increase in the score compared to the control group. However, the combination of EPO and BMAC in the implanted scaffold showed a significant improvement (p = 0.02) in the histological score.The results of our study show that in mini-pigs, the combination of EPO and BMAC leads to an enhanced osteochondral healing. However, additional research is necessary to further improve the repair tissue and to define the role of MSCs and EPO in cartilage repair.",0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation is demonstrating promising outcomes for the treatment of patellofemoral cartilage lesions, but may not suffice for knees with underlying mechanical anomalies as trochlear dysplasia, where adjuvant trochleoplasty or tibial tubercle osteotomy may be required to prevent patellofemoral instability and to protect the graft from wear and damage. Rigorous radiographic assessment is important to discern the type of dysplasia, notably the presence of a potentially pathogenic supra-trochlear spur. Trochleoplasty or other realignment procedures such as tibial tubercle osteotomy should be considered where necessary to correct underlying trochlear deformities and thereby avoid iatrogenic complications or failure.",0

This study investigated the ability of autologous implantation approach using three dimensional (3D) constructs engineered from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) seeded on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with or without fibrin as cells carrier for the repair of osteochondral defect in rabbit model. The engineered 3D constructs – PLGA/Fibrin/BMSCs and PLGA/BMSCs – were cultured for 3 weeks in vitro and implanted autologously to the osteochondral defect created in the rabbit knee. The in vivo constructs were harvested and evaluated by means of gross observation, histology assessment, gene expression study, sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) production assay and biomechanical evaluation at 6 and 12 weeks post implantation. The results showed that the osteochondral defects treated with the PLGA/Fibrin/BMSCs constructs exhibited better repairment, more cartilaginous extracellular matrix, higher sGAG production, superior compressive strength and more intense expression of chondrogenic marker genes than the PLGA/BMSCs group. This study suggested that the PLGA/Fibrin/BMSCs has the potential to treat osteochondral defect and may be presented as a viable therapeutic option for those who would be in need from the life-extending benefits of tissue replacement or repair.",0

The outcomes of clinical score, quality of life (QoL), pain relief score, and failure rate were assessed.A final group of 12 randomized controlled trials were included that enrolled a total of 659 patients with knee cartilage lesions: 332 patients had received ACI and 327 patients had undergone MF. Patients ranged in age from 25 to 41 years, and the majority were male. Lesion size ranged from 2.3 to 10.0 cm2. Pooled analysis found no significant difference in the improvement in International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores or overall Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score measures between patients in the ACI and MF groups at 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year follow-up examinations or in failure rate at 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year follow-up timepoints. However, patients treated with ACI had a significant benefit in activities of daily living at follow-up of 5 years or less compared with patients treated with MF. ACI treatment also showed better improvement in QoL and pain relief than MF at 5-year and 2-year follow-up examinations, respectively.The pooled analysis found no significant difference in the improvement in International Knee Documentation Committee or Lysholm scores or overall Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score measures between patients in the ACI and MF groups at 1 to 5 years of follow-up. Patients treated with ACI may have a significant benefit in activities of daily living, QoL, and pain relief compared with patients treated with MF, although clinical relevance may not be achieved.Level II, systematic review of Level I and II investigations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1314958,Mittelfristige klinische und radiologische Ergebnisse nach autologer osteochondraler Transplantation unter Berücksichtigung der Lebensqualität,"Treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects remains a challenge in musculoskeletal surgery. Autologous osteochondral transplantation represents a possible solution for the repair of affected areas. However, some problems like degenerative changes of the transplanted cylinders and the surrounding cartilage or lack of cylinder integration to the surrounding cartilage arise with this method. Thus mid-term results respecting the quality of life are useful for assessment of the method.We investigated 22 patients with a mean follow-up of 88 ± 14.5 months after autologous osteochondral transplantation due to a full-thickness cartilage defect of the medial femoral condyle. Beside clinical scores we assessed at follow-up the quality of life using the SF-36 health survey and the EQ-5D. Furthermore, radiological changes were detected and MRI was performed in 21 patients. A control group of 19 patients, treated with microfracture, was matched in terms of BMI, gender and age. Exclusion criteria for this group were tibial kissing lesion, ligament instability, arthrosis and malalignment.In a longitudinal comparison with results 13.5 months after operation, no difference in Lysholm score was found. In plain radiographs higher degrees of arthritic changes in the medial compartment compared to the unaffected knee were observed. MRI revealed a mean modified MOCART score of 41.2 ± 7.7 for the OAT group and of 39.4 ± 16.1 for the microfracture group, without being significant. For OAT patients all cylinders showed an osseous integration. However, cylinder oedema was found in 9 patients. Those patients had a higher intensity of pain on a visual analogue scale. Quality of life was better for OAT patients in the physical scale of SF-36, but not in the mental scale.Autologous osteochondral transplantation has an unaltered significance in treating full-thickness cartilage defects and leads to satisfying mid-term results. The development of early arthritic changes might not be preventable by this method. Oedema of the transplanted cylinders is attended by higher pain intensity and might be an indirect sign of cartilage degeneration.",0

The Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Tegner activity level scale and visual analog scale for pain scores were used to evaluate the outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed postoperatively to assess graft position and chondral degeneration/damage.A total of 31 of the original 33 patients were evaluated over a mean follow-up period of 37.0months. Patients demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all scoring data from the pre-operative to two-year follow-up period. The mean postoperative extrusion was 1.59±1.20mm (range 0-3.9mm). There were no significant differences in the distribution of the grade of chondral damage between the pre-operative and two-year follow-up periods. Three patients (9.7%) showed no improvements or had lower evaluation scores. One patient underwent matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation at one year after LMAT.Lateral meniscus allograft transplantation combined with intra-articular PRP injection resulted in statistically significant improvements in all functions and pain scores, and clinical improvements in Tegner, IKDC, and Lysholm values during short-term follow-up.

,Cellular distribution of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides in normal rodent tissues.,"The distribution of intravenously injected phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (P = S ODN) was studied in vivo in rodent tissues using three histologic methods: immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes P = S ODN ISIS 2105; direct fluorescence microscopy of P = S ODN ISIS 2105 conjugated to rhodamine; and autoradiography of 14C-labeled P = S ODN ISIS 2302. All three methods gave the same pattern of oligonucleotide distribution, and the intensity of the histologic signal agreed with previously published pharmacokinetic data on the relative concentration of P = S ODN in different organs. Proximal tubule cells in the kidney and Kupffer and endothelial cells in the liver were among the most heavily labeled with P = S ODN at all doses and time-points. Connective tissues proper, such as the lamina propria and submucosa of the intestine and the dermis and subcutaneous layer of the skin, were also labeled, whereas the P = S ODN signal was weak or negative in epithelial and muscle cells in the skin and intestine. At 2 hours postinjection, P = S ODN were clearly detectable in the extracellular matrix in loose and dense connective tissues, although by 24 hours, the label was predominantly intracellular. Large, nucleated cells in red marrow, and the connective tissues around bone and skeletal muscle cells and lining the knee joint, were positive for oligonucleotide, whereas P = S ODN were not detected in erythrocytes, cartilage, compact bone, and skeletal muscle. In spleen, white pulp was negative for P = S ODN, whereas cells surrounding the sinusoids and nucleated cells in the red pulp were strongly positive for P = S ODN. Our results provide specific information on the tissue and cellular localization of P = S ODN within organs in vivo. The data presented will be used as a reference for studies of P = S ODN distribution in diseased tissues and the distribution of modified oligonucleotides. Furthermore, because our results indicate which cell types are likely to be affected by antisense oligonucleotides, they can be used to guide future in vivo applications of the technology.",0

This requires a different surgical technique and preoperative planning compared to ACI alone. In addition, pain from bone marrow donor site locations can be expected and should be part of patient consent and expectations. This study evaluates whether the MRI made as part of the standard preoperative cartilage patient work up has the diagnostic accuracy to predict the need for a sandwich procedure.Retrospectively, 185 preoperative MRI scans (PD and T2 sequences) of patients planned for ACI were included. The integrity of the subchondral bone and lamina was scored by four different observers (3 radiologists, and 1 orthopaedic resident). The depth of the defect was measured perpendicular from articulating surface to the bottom of the bony lesion. The area under the curve (AUC) for subchondral defect on MRI (i.e. lamina or bone defect or expert impression), depth measurements and eventual sandwich procedure were calculated. Also inter-observer Kappa values were determined.The AUCs for lamina (0.74-0.80) and bone defect (0.73-0.79) were fair and inter-observer Kappas ranged from 0.49 to 0.76, indicating a moderate-good inter-observer agreement and moderate prediction of the need for a sandwich procedure based on the presence of lamina and or subchondral bone defect on MRI. However, depth measurements resulted in an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84-0.95,) with an optimal cut-off point at 6.5mm depth of the lesion (90% sensitivity, 80% specificity) to predict the need for a sandwich procedure.Ours is the first study examining MRI as a diagnostic tool in predicting the need for a sandwich procedure. Our results show that the integrity of the subchondral layer on MRI has a moderate role in predicting the need for an eventual autologous bone graft to augment ACI whereas in our cohort a depth of the lesion above 6.5mm accurately predicts the need for a sandwich procedure. This can aid in optimising the preoperative planning and patient consent.",0

An experimental animal model of the ankle joint is not available. The aim of this study was to test a newly developed animal model for osteochondral defects of the ankle in vivo. Osteochondral defects were created in the talus of goat hind legs using a posterolateral surgical approach. The defects were filled with either autologous cancellous bone or donor demineralized bone matrix or left empty as control. After 12 weeks of healing, the specimens were analyzed with radiography, macroscopy, microcomputed tomography, histology, histomorphometry, and fluorescence microscopy. It was possible to create a standardized defect in each talus. The implanted material remained in place. The analyses showed that most bony tissue was generated in the defects filled with autologous bone and least in the control defects. Our findings show that a standard osteochondral defect can be created in the talus by a relatively simple procedure in a large animal that allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The model can be used in future experiments to investigate alternative treatment methods before they are introduced into clinical practice.",0

The rhCII hydrogels were seeded with BM-MSCs and cultured in a xeno-free chondro-inductive medium for 14, 28 and 84 days. High-density pellet cultures served as controls. The samples were subjected to biochemical, histological and gene expression analyses. Although the cells deposited glycosaminoglycans into the extracellular space significantly more slowly in the rhCII hydrogels compared to the high-density pellets, a similar potential of matrix deposition was reached by the end of the 84-day culture. At day 28 of culture, the gene expression level for cartilage marker genes (i.e. genes encoding for Sox9 transcription factor, Collagen type II and Aggrecan) were considerably lower in the rhCII hydrogels than in the high-density pellets, but at the end of the 84-day culture period, all the cartilage marker genes analysed were expressed at a similar level. Interestingly, the expression of the matrix metallopeptidases (MMP)-13, MMP-14 and MMP-8, i.e. extracellular collagen network-degrading enzymes, were transiently upregulated in the rhCII hydrogel, indicating active matrix reorganization. This study demonstrated that the rhCII hydrogel functions as a xeno-free platform for BM-MSC chondrogenesis, although the process is delayed. The reversible catabolic reaction evoked by the rhCII hydrogel might be beneficial in graft integration in vivo and pinpoints the need to further explore the use of hydrogels containing recombinant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to induce the chondrogenesis of MSCs.

MSCs were isolated from New Zealand White rabbits and labelled with DiR (1.25-20 mu g/mL). Viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed by XTT- and Caspase-3/-7-testing. Chondrogenic potential was evaluated by measurement of glycosaminoglycans. Labelled cells and unlabeled controls (n = 3) underwent FMT-XCT imaging before and after chondrogenic differentiation. Osteochondral defects were created surgically in rabbit knees (n = 6). Unlabeled and labelled MSCs were implanted in fibrin-clots and imaged by FMT-XCT. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple regression models. DiR-labelling of MSCs resulted in a dose-dependent fluorescence signal on planar images in trans-illumination mode. No significant reduction in viability or induction of apoptosis was detected at concentrations below 10 mu g DiR/mL (p \textbackslashtextgreater .05); the chondrogenic potential of MSCs was not affected (p \textbackslashtextgreater .05). FMT-XCT of labelled MSCs in osteochondral defects showed a significant signal of the transplant (p \textbackslashtextless .05) with additional high-resolution anatomical information about its osteochondral integration. FMT-XCT allows for detection of stem cell implantation within osteochondral regeneration processes. DiR-labelling of MSCs shows no toxic side effects or impairment of chondrogenesis. Fluorescence molecular tomography allows for detection of MSCs for osteochondral defect repair. FMT-XCT helps to improve evaluation of cell implantation and osteochondral regeneration processes.",0
https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00694,Autologous Fractionated Adipose Tissue as a Natural Biomaterial and Novel One-Step Stem Cell Therapy for Repairing Articular Cartilage Defects,"Articular cartilage damage remains a tough challenge for clinicians. Stem cells have emerged promising biologics in regenerative medicine. Previous research has widely demonstrated that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) can promote cartilage repair due to their multipotency. However, enzymatic isolation and monolayer expansion of ADSCs decrease their differentiation potential and limit their clinical application. Here, a novel adipose tissue-derived product, extracellular matrix/stromal vascular fraction gel (ECM/SVF-gel), was obtained by simple mechanical shifting and centrifugation to separate the fat oil and concentrate the effective constituents. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of this natural biomaterial on the repair of articular cartilage defects. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the fibrous structure in the ECM/SVF-gel was preserved. ADSCs sprouted from the ECM/SVF-gel were characterized by their ability of differentiation into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes. In a rabbit model, critical-sized cartilage defects (diameter, 4 mm; depth, 1.5 mm) were created and treated with microfracture (MF) or a combination of autologous ECM/SVF-gel injection. The knee joints were evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks through magnetic resonance imaging, macroscopic observation, histology, and immunohistochemistry. The International Cartilage Repair Society score and histological score were significantly higher in the ECM/SVF-gel group than those in the MF-treated group. The ECM/SVF-gel distinctly improved cartilage regeneration, integration with surrounding normal cartilage, and the expression of hyaline cartilage marker, type II collagen, in comparison with the MF treatment alone. Overall, the ready-to-use ECM/SVF-gel is a promising therapeutic strategy to facilitate articular cartilage regeneration. Moreover, due to the simple, time-sparing, cost-effective, enzyme-free, and minimally invasive preparation process, this gel provides a valuable alternative to stem cell-based therapy for clinical translation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0414,Osteochondral Repair Using a Scaffold-Free Tissue-Engineered Construct Derived from Synovial Mesenchymal Stem Cells and a Hydroxyapatite-Based Artificial Bone,"For an ideal osteochondral repair, it is important to facilitate zonal restoration of the subchondral bone and the cartilage, layer by layer. Specifically, restoration of the osteochondral junction and secure integration with adjacent cartilage could be considered key factors. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of a combined material comprising a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and a hydroxyapatite (HA) artificial bone using a rabbit osteochondral defect model. Osteochondral defects were created on the femoral groove of skeletally mature rabbits. The TEC and HA artificial bone were hybridized to develop a combined implant just before use, which was then implanted into defects (N=23). In the control group, HA alone was implanted (N=18). Histological evaluation and micro-indentation testing was performed for the evaluation of repair tissue. Normal knees were used as an additional control group for biomechanical testing (N=5). At hybridization, the TEC rapidly attached onto the surface of HA artificial bone block, which was implantable to osteochondral defects. Osteochondral defects treated with the combined implants exhibited more rapid subchondral bone repair coupled with the development of cartilaginous tissue with good tissue integration to the adjacent host cartilage when assessed at 6 months post implantation. Conversely, the control group exhibited delayed subchondral bone repair. In addition, the repair cartilaginous tissue in this group had poor integration to adjacent cartilage and contained clustered chondrocytes, suggesting an early osteoarthritis (OA)-like degenerative change at 6 months post implantation. Biomechanically, the osteochondral repair tissue treated with the combined implants at 6 months restored tissue stiffness, similar to normal osteochondral tissue. The combined implants significantly accelerated and improved osteochondral repair. Specifically, earlier restoration of subchondral bone, as well as good tissue integration of repair cartilage to adjacent host tissue could be clinically relevant in terms of the acceleration of postoperative rehabilitation and longer-term durability of repaired articular surface in patients with osteochondral lesions, including those with OA. In addition, the combined implant could be considered a promising MSC-based bio-implant with regard to safety and cost-effectiveness, considering that the TEC is a scaffold-free implant and HA artificial bone has been widely used in clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0b013e32835aa28d,Stem cell-based therapies for osteoarthritis,"Regenerative medicine offers the exciting potential of developing alternatives to total joint replacement for treating osteoarthritis. In this article, we highlight recent work that addresses key challenges of stem cell-based therapies for osteoarthritis and provide examples of innovative ways in which stem cells can aid in the treatment of osteoarthritis.Significant progress has been made in understanding the challenges to successful stem cell therapy, such as the effects of age or disease on stem cell properties, altered stem cell function due to an inflammatory joint environment and phenotypic instability in vivo. Novel scaffold designs have been shown to enhance the mechanical properties of tissue-engineered cartilage and have also improved the integration of newly formed tissue within the joint. Emerging strategies such as injecting stem cells directly into the joint, manipulating endogenous stem cells to enhance regenerative capacity and utilizing stem cells for drug discovery have expanded the potential uses of stem cells in treating osteoarthritis.Several recent studies have greatly advanced the development and preclinical evaluation of potential stem cell-based treatments for osteoarthritis through novel approaches focused on cell therapy, tissue engineering and drug discovery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-021-02370-1,Comparison of chondrogenesis-related biological behaviors between human urine-derived stem cells and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from the same individual,"Abstract Background Stem cells are the main choice for seed cells in tissue engineering, but using most traditional stem cells requires invasive and complicated procedures. Human urine-derived stem cells (hUSCs) are an alternative stem cell source with the advantages of being isolated noninvasively and repetitively from the same individual. The aim of this study was to compare chondrogenesis-related biological behaviors between hUSCs and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) from the same individual. Methods hUSCs and hBMSCs were isolated from six patients who underwent iliac bone grafting. Cell morphology, proliferation, colony-forming, migration, and multidifferentiation analyses were performed in vitro. Then, acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACM) scaffolds were fabricated for in vivo implantation. The comparisons of cell viability, morphology, proliferation, and chondrogenesis between hUSCs and hBMSCs cultured on scaffolds were performed before implantation. The scaffolds loaded with hUSCs or hBMSCs were implanted into a rabbit knee model to repair cartilage defects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro-computed tomography (μCT) Analyses, inflammation and toxicity assays, gross observation, and histological evaluation were performed to evaluate the cartilage repair effects. Results In in vitro experiments, hUSCs had better capacity for proliferation, colony-forming, and migration compared to hBMSCs in the same passage, while hBMSCs had greater osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic abilities compared to hUSCs in the same passage. Both hUSCs and hBMSCs at passage 3 had the strongest potential for proliferation, colony-forming, and multilineage differentiation compared to cells in other passages. The ACM scaffolds loaded with hUSCs or hBMSCs both significantly promoted the repair of cartilage defects in the rabbit knee model at 12 weeks’ postimplantation, and the new tissue was mainly hyaline cartilage. However, there was no significant difference in cartilage repair effects between hUSCs and hBMSCs. Conclusions In in vitro experiments, hUSCs presented better capacity for proliferation, while hBMSCs had greater chondrogenic ability. However, hUSCs and hBMSCs had similar cartilage repair effects in vivo. Results indicated that hUSCs can be a stem cell alternative for cartilage regeneration and provide a powerful platform for cartilage tissue engineering and clinical transformation.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516677255,Magnetic Resonance Imaging Characterization and Clinical Outcomes After NeoCart Surgical Therapy as a Primary Reparative Treatment for Knee Cartilage Injuries,"Background: Autologous cartilage tissue implants, including the NeoCart implant, are intended to repair focal articular cartilage lesions. Short-term results from United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) phase I and phase II clinical trials indicated that the NeoCart implant was safe when surgically applied as a cell-based therapy and efficacious compared with microfracture. Hypothesis: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis would reveal NeoCart tissue maturation through to 60-month follow-up. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients with symptomatic full-thickness cartilage lesions of the distal femoral condyle were treated with NeoCart in FDA clinical trials. Safety and efficacy were evaluated prospectively by MRI and clinical patient-reported outcomes (PROs) through to 60-month follow-up. Qualitative MRI metrics were quantified according to modified MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) criteria, with an independent evaluation of repair tissue signal intensity. Subjective PROs and objective range of motion (ROM) were obtained at baseline and through to 60 months. Results: Twenty-nine patients treated with NeoCart were observed over a mean of 52.0 ± 15.5 months (median, 60 months). MOCART analyses indicated significant improvement ( P &lt; .001) in cartilage quality from 3 to 24 months, with stabilization from 24 to 60 months. Signal intensity of the repair tissue evolved from hyperintense at early follow-up to isointense after 6 months and to hypointense after 24 months. The temporal progression toward hypointense T2 signals at later time points observed here indicated a further reorganization of the repair tissue toward a dense tissue that was less similar to the surrounding native tissue. However, 80% of patients showed evidence of subchondral bone changes on MRI at all time points; 4 patients (14%) showed no improvement of MRI criteria. Compared with baseline values, significant improvement ( P &lt; .001) was seen in PROs (mean [±SD] baseline to mean [±SD] final follow-up), including the International Knee Documentation Committee score (47.9 ± 17.4 to 75.5 ± 22.1), physical component summary of the Short Form–36 (40.5 ± 7.2 to 51.4 ± 8.1), and all 5 domains of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (Pain: 64.8 ± 12.1 to 86.1 ± 17.3; Activities of Daily Living: 75.5 ± 14.8 to 91.6 ± 13.8; Quality of Life: 28.6 ± 15.5 to 69.4 ± 28.0; Symptoms: 65.8 ± 13.8 to 86.6 ± 13.4; Sports and Recreation: 41.4 ± 24.3 to 72.4 ± 28.8). Significant ( P &lt; .0001) decreases from baseline scores for the visual analog scale for pain (34.6 ± 22.5) were seen by 6 months and sustained at final follow-up (14.3 ± 18.4). ROM significantly ( P &lt; .0001) improved from baseline (131.5° ± 7.9°) to final follow-up (140.7° ± 6.3°). Conclusion: Longitudinal MRI analysis demonstrated that NeoCart-based repair tissue is durable and evolves over time. For a majority of patients, this progression trended from an initial hyperintense signal to a hypointense signal at later follow-ups. Changes in radiographic measures over time corresponded with improvement in clinical measures, with maximum benefits experienced at 24-month follow-up. Similarly, clinical efficacy for the total cohort, determined by clinical outcome scores, reached a maximum at 24 months without decline to 60 months. Results from safety and exploratory clinical trials indicate that NeoCart is a safe and effective treatment for articular cartilage lesions through to 5-year follow-up.

Patients were excluded if they underwent implantation of premade plugs, had an overlapping OCA configuration (""snowman"" technique), or did not undergo MRI at 6 months postoperatively. Patients were matched by lesion location, lesion size, age, and body mass index, as well as whether they underwent previous surgical procedures. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation, the independent t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the χ2 test.A total of 58 patients (29 per group) were included in this study, with an average age of 36.4 ± 10.1 years and mean body mass index of 28.6 ± 5.1. The mean size of the analyzed OCA plugs was 3.3 ± 1 cm2. At an average imaging follow-up of 5.6 ± 1 months, 86.2% of the grafts had achieved osseous integration at the graft-host junction and 75.9% did not show any cystic changes in the subchondral bone. No difference in any OCAMRISS subscale was seen comparing OCAs with and without BMA augmentation (P > .05). Specifically, osseous integration and subchondral cyst formation were comparable between groups (P = .128 and P = .539, respectively).OCAs showed excellent osseous integration at the graft-host junction on 6-month postoperative MRI. The treatment of OCAs with autogenous BMA did not result in superior imaging outcomes when analyzed using the OCAMRISS.Level III, case-control study.",1

Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 57 athletes with a mean age of 24.3 years and with a symptomatic lesion of the articular cartilage in the knee were randomized to undergo either OAT or MF procedure. There were 28 athletes in OAT group and 29 in MF group. Patients were evaluated using a modified Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scores, MRI and clinical assessment after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the surgery. According to the modified HSS and ICRS scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 52% after MF procedure (P \textbackslashtextless 0.001). In 12, 24 and 36 months after the operations, the HSS and ICRS showed statistically significantly better results in the OAT group (P=0.03; P=0.006; P=0.006). Twenty-six (93%) athletes following OAT and fifteen (52%) athletes following MF returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4-8 months) after the operations. At an average of 37.1 months follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in athletes has shown significant superiority of the OAT over MF for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee.",1

The heterogeneity of the results presented in the studies precluded a meta-analysis. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Microfracture appears to be effective in smaller lesions and is usually associated with a greater proportion of fibrocartilage production, which may have an effect on durability and eventual failure. Autologous chondrocyte implantation is an effective treatment that may result in a greater proportion of hyaline-like tissue at the repair site, which may in turn have a beneficial effect on durability and failure; it appears to be effective in larger lesions. Autologous chondrocyte implantation with periosteum has been shown to be associated with symptomatic cartilage hypertrophy more frequently than autologous chondrocyte implantation with collagen membrane. Matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation is technically less challenging than the other techniques available, and in lesions greater than 4 cm<sup>2</sup>, it has been shown to be more effective than microfracture. <h3>Level of Evidence</h3> Level IV, systematic review of Level I-IV studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1271960,Clinical and MRI Considerations in Sports-Related Knee Joint Cartilage Injury and Cartilage Repair,"Cartilage injuries of the knee occur frequently in professional and amateur athletes and can be associated with severe debilitation and morbidity. They are commonly associated with ligament injuries but also may be frequently isolated. Increasing awareness and advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to increasing diagnosis and recognition of these injuries. Articular cartilage is just 2 to 4 mm thick and is avascular, alymphatic, and aneural. It has a limited capacity for healing, and there has been increasing use of cartilage repair techniques to treat these lesions in the active population. Strategies for cartilage repair include marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture/drilling, osteochondral grafting, and autologous chondrocyte transplants. MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis and grading of cartilage injury and is useful in the follow-up and monitoring of these repair procedures. It is important for radiologists and clinicians to be aware of the capabilities and limitations of MRI in assessing cartilage injury and to be familiar with common postsurgical appearances to facilitate assessment and follow-up in this population. This article reviews the clinical findings and MRI imaging appearances of cartilage injury. The management options are discussed as well as common postsurgical appearances following the various interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0284185120969955,Correlation between the subchondral bone marrow lesions and cartilage repair tissue after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee: a cross-sectional study,"Background The contribution of the subchondral bone in the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) has long been recognized, but its role in cartilage repair procedures has only recently attracted more attention. Purpose To explore the correlation between the cartilage repair tissue (RT) and the subchondral bone marrow lesions (BMLs) after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) in the knee joint. Material and Methods A total of 30 patients who underwent MACI in the knee from January 2015 to June 2018 and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were recruited in this study. The MRI results of cartilage RT were evaluated using T2* relaxation time. Subchondral BMLs were also qualitatively evaluated by use of the two-dimensional proton density-weighted fat-suppressed (2D-PD-FS) and three-dimensional dual-echo steady-state (3D-DESS) sequences. Results The univariate analysis displayed a significant negative correlation between subchondral BMLs and cartilage RT ( P &lt; 0.01). In the minimally adjusted model (only age, sex, and body mass index [BMI] adjusted), the results did not show obvious changes (β = –6.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = –10.99 to –2.09; P = 0.008). After adjustment for the full models (age, sex, BMI, defect size, combined injury, and preoperative duration of symptoms adjusted), the connection was also detected (β = –6.66, 95% CI –11.82 to –1.50; P = 0.019). Conclusion After MACI, the subchondral BMLs are significantly correlated with cartilage RT-T 2 * relaxation time. The role of subchondral bone in cartilage repair procedures should not be underestimated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-015-3525-8,Combined osteochondral allograft and meniscal allograft transplantation: a survivorship analysis,"The efficacy of meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) and osteochondral allografting (OCA) as individual treatment modalities for select applications is well established. MAT and OCA are considered symbiotic procedures due to a complementary spectrum of indications and reciprocal contraindications. However, few outcomes of concomitant MAT and OCA have been reported. This study is a retrospective review of patients who received simultaneous MAT and OCA between 1983 and 2011. Forty-eight (twenty-nine male: nineteen female) patients with a median age of 35.8 years (15-66) received combined MAT and OCA procedures between 1983 and 2011. Forty-three patients had received previous surgery with a median of 3 procedures (1-11 procedures). The underlying diagnosis was trauma (tibial plateau fracture) in 33 % with osteoarthritis predominating in 54.2 % of cases. Thirty-one patients received a lateral meniscus, 16 received a medial meniscus and one patient received bilateral MAT. The median number of OCAs was two per patient (1-5 grafts), with a median graft area of 15 cm(2) (0.7-41 cm(2)). There were 21 unipolar, 24 bipolar (tibiofemoral) and three multifocal lesions. Thirty-six MATs constituted a compound tibial plateau OCA with native meniscus attached. At follow-up, failure was defined as any procedure resulting in removal or revision of one or more of the grafts. Patients completed the modified Merle d'Aubign, and Postel (18-point) scale, Knee Society Function (KS-F) score, and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores. Patient satisfaction was also captured. Twenty-six of 48 patients (54.2 %) required reoperation, but only 11 patients (22.9 %) were noted to have failed (10 MAT and 11 OCA). The mean time to failure was 3.2 years (95 % CI 1.5-4.9 years) and 2.7 years (95 % CI 1.3-4.2 years) for MAT and OCA, respectively. The 5-year survivorship was 78 and 73 % for MAT and OCA respectively, and 69 and 68 % at 10 years. Six of the failures were in the OA cases and one was an OCD lesion where bipolar grafts were utilized. The OCD case underwent a revision OCA and remains intact. The others were converted to knee arthroplasty. One case failed due to early deep infection, ultimately requiring arthrodesis. Of those with grafts still intact, the mean clinical follow-up was 6.8 years (1.7-17.1 years). Statistically significant improvements in all outcome scores were noted between baseline and the latest follow-up. In total, 90 % of those responding would have the surgery again and 78 % were either extremely satisfied or satisfied with the outcome. The overall success rate of concomitant MAT and OCA was comparable with reported results for either procedure in isolation. A trend towards a worse outcome was observed with bipolar tibiofemoral grafts in the setting of OA. Comparatively better results in less advanced, unipolar disease could suggest a benefit to early intervention that might merit a lower treatment threshold for combined MAT and OCA.",0

Histology is probably the gold standard, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to decrease the need for invasive histological biopsies. The 3D magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score is a reliable yet elaborate tool. Moreover, literature is controversial concerning the correlation of histology and MRI. Design To test the applicability of the International Cartilage Regeneration and Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) II and MOCART 3D score for the evaluation of aged osteochondral regenerates in a large animal model, and to identify correlating histological and MRI parameters. Osteochondral defects in medial femoral condyles of n = 12 adult sheep were reconstructed with biodegradable bilayer implants. About 19.5 months postoperation, n = 10 joints were analyzed with MRI (3D MOCART score). Histological samples were analyzed using the ICRS II score; both pre- and post-training. The intraclass correlation coefficient, the inter-rater reliability, and the 95% confidence interval were calculated. Matching histological and MRI parameters were tested for correlation. Results We found a statistically significant correlation of all histological parameters. MRI parameters reflecting “overall” assessments had very strong inter-rater correlations. Statistically significant strong correlations were found for the MRI parameters defect filling, cartilage interface, bone interface, and surface. For defect overall (MRI) and overall assessment (ICRS II), we found a significant yet mild correlation. Conclusions The ICRS II and the 3D MOCART score are applicable to aged osteochondral regenerates. Prior training on the scoring systems is essential. Select MRI and histological parameters correlate; however, the only statistically significant correlation was found for overall assessment.",0

Design Seven PT patients and 5 ACT patients who underwent surgery on the femoral condyle between 1986 and 1996 were included. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were assessed by the clinical questionnaires: Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for knee pain. The morphological (MOCART score) and biochemical quality (glycosaminoglycans [GAGs] content and collagen integrity) of cartilage transplants and surrounding articular cartilage were analyzed by 7T MRI. The results of the PT and ACT patients were compared. Finally, a detailed morphological analysis of the grafts alone was performed. Results No statistically significant difference was found for the PROMs and MOCART scores of PT and ACT patients. Evaluation of the graft alone showed poor repair tissue quality and high prevalence of intralesional osteophyte formation in both the PT and ACT patients. Penetration of the graft surface by the intralesional osteophyte was related to biochemically damaged opposing tibial cartilage; GAG content was significantly lower in patients with an osteophyte penetrating the graft surface. Conclusions Both PT and ACT patients have a high incidence of intralesional osteophyte formation 25 years after surgery. The resulting biochemical damage to the opposing tibial cartilage might be dependent on osteophyte morphology.",1

Each method has advantages and limitations, and no single technique has gained widespread use. We present a technique for implantation of a cryopreserved osteochondral allograft (Cartiform) for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects. Cartiform is a cryopreserved osteochondral allograft composed of chondrocytes, chondrogenic growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins. This implant allows for regenerative treatment of full-thickness cartilage lesions in a single surgical procedure.",0

Autologous osteochondral transplantation represents one solution: to bring about a hyaline or hyalinelike repair of the defected area. The current authors discuss the experimental background and their 8 years of clinical experience with the autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty. Several series of animal studies and subsequent clinical practice have confirmed the survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage. Hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage fill the donor sites located on the nonweightbearing surfaces and surfaces that bear less weight. Clinical scores, imaging techniques, control arthroscopies, histologic examination of biopsy samples, and cartilage stiffness measurements were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes and quality of the transplanted cartilage. According to these investigations, femoral condylar implantations have shown good to excellent results in 92%, tibial resurfacing in 88%, patellar and/or trochlear mosaicplasties in 81%, and talar procedures in 94% of patients. The Bandi score showed long-term donor site disturbances in 3% of patients. Fifty-eight of the 68 control arthroscopies had good gliding surfaces, histologically-proven survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage, and fibrocartilage covering of the donor sites. In the entire series, there were four deep infections and 34 painful hemarthroses after surgery. A multicentric, comparative, prospective evaluation of 413 arthroscopic resurfacing procedures (mosaicplasty, Pridie drilling, abrasion arthroplasty, and microfracture cases in homogenized subgroups) showed that mosaicplasty gave a more favorable clinical outcome in the long-term followup, than the other three techniques. Intermediate-term evaluation of the femoral condylar implantations (3-6-years followup) and talar mosaicplasties (3-7-years followup) confirmed the durability of the early results. From these encouraging results from an increasingly large series and similar results from other centers, it seems that autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty may be a viable alternative treatment of localized full-thickness cartilage damage of the weightbearing surfaces of the knee and other weightbearing synovial joints.",0

More recently, techniques have evolved from 2-step techniques that use autologous chondrocyte expansion to 1-step techniques that make use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) embedded onto biocompatible scaffolding. Our 1-step technique has been further developed to provide cell-based cartilage repair using MSCs that have the potential to be used in an off-the-shelf manner, without the need for autologous tissue harvest. Precursor MSCs can be isolated in abundance from the Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord tissue. These cells have been shown to have the desired capacity for proliferation, differentiation, and release of trophic factors that make them an excellent candidate for use in the clinical setting to provide cell-based restoration of hyaline-like cartilage. Although allogeneic in nature, these cells stimulate little or no host immune response and can be stored for long periods while maintaining viability. We present a technique of cartilage repair in the knee using Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs embedded onto scaffolding and implanted in a minimally invasive fashion using dry arthroscopy.",0
https://doi.org/10.5312/wjo.v8.i1.12,Current management of talar osteochondral lesions,"Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT) occur in up to 70% of acute ankle sprains and fractures. OLT have become increasingly recognized with the advancements in cartilage-sensitive diagnostic imaging modalities. Although OLT may be treated nonoperatively, a number of surgical techniques have been described for patients whom surgery is indicated. Traditionally, treatment of symptomatic OLT have included either reparative procedures, such as bone marrow stimulation (BMS), or replacement procedures, such as autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT). Reparative procedures are generally indicated for OLT < 150 mm2 in area. Replacement strategies are used for large lesions or after failed primary repair procedures. Although short- and medium-term results have been reported, long-term studies on OLT treatment strategies are lacking. Biological augmentation including platelet-rich plasma and concentrated bone marrow aspirate is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of OLT to enhance the biological environment during healing. In this review, we describe the most up-to-date clinical evidence of surgical outcomes, as well as both the mechanical and biological concerns associated with BMS and AOT. In addition, we will review the recent evidence for biological adjunct therapies that aim to improve outcomes and longevity of both BMS and AOT procedures.",0

Recent studies have reported good to excellent outcomes with the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) for pain relief in the treatment of focal chondral lesions and osteoarthritis of the knee. However, the harvesting and processing technique are crucial to achieve satisfactory results. Several studies have examined outcomes after BMAC injection, with encouraging results, but there is a lack of consensus in terms of the frequency of injection, the amount of BMAC that is injected, and the timing of BMAC injections. The purpose of this Technical Note was to describe a standardized bone marrow aspiration harvesting technique and processing method.",0

The augmentation of OCA with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) has been hypothesized to improve osseous incorporation of the implanted allograft. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of autogenous BMAC treatment on osseous integration at the graft-host bony interface after OCA. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective review of patients treated with OCA+BMAC or OCA alone for full-thickness chondral defects of the distal femur from March 2015 to December 2016 was conducted. Seventeen knees treated with OCA+BMAC and 16 knees treated with OCA alone underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early postoperative phase (mean, 6 months). Eighteen knees treated with OCA+BMAC and 16 knees treated with OCA alone underwent MRI in the late postoperative phase (mean, 12 months). Bone, cartilage, and ancillary features on MRI were graded using the Osteochondral Allograft MRI Scoring System (OCAMRISS) by a musculoskeletal radiologist blinded to the patient’s history and treatment. Results: There were no significant differences in the demographics or lesion characteristics between treatment groups in either postoperative phase. In the early postoperative phase, the mean OCAMRISS bone score was 3.0 ± 0.7 and 3.3 ± 0.7 for the OCA+BMAC group and OCA alone group, respectively ( P = .76); 71% (OCA+BMAC) and 81% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated discernible clefts at the graft-host junction ( P = .69), and 41% (OCA+BMAC) and 25% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated cystic changes at the graft and graft-host junction ( P = .46). In the late postoperative phase, the mean OCAMRISS bone score was 2.7 ± 0.8 and 2.9 ± 0.8 for the OCA+BMAC group and OCA alone group, respectively ( P = .97); 44% (OCA+BMAC) and 63% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated discernible clefts at the graft-host junction ( P = .33), and 50% (OCA+BMAC) and 31% (OCA alone) of MRI scans demonstrated the presence of cystic changes at the graft and graft-host junction ( P = .32). The mean OCAMRISS cartilage, ancillary, and total scores were not significantly different between groups in either postoperative phase. Conclusion: OCA augmented with BMAC was not associated with improved osseous integration; decreased cystic changes; or other bone, cartilage, and ancillary feature changes compared with OCA alone.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-012-1662-9,Practice in rehabilitation after cartilage therapy: an expert survey,"BACKGROUND: Current cartilage therapy modalities like microfracture, ACT/MACT, AMIC or osteochondral transplantation are important tools to treat symptomatic (osteo)chondral lesions of the knee joint. However, until now there exists no high-level evidence based accepted rehabilitation plan for the postoperative treatment. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This survey describes the predominantly used rehabilitation plan as implemented by expert musculoskeletal surgeons for operatively treated (osteo)chondral lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Survey and systematic review. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire covering general and specific items concerning aftercare following cartilage therapy in the knee joint was designed and disposed to analyze rehabilitation programs among a population of expert musculoskeletal surgeons of the AGA (Society of arthroscopy and joint surgery). All instructors (304 in 01/2011) were included into the survey. A total of 246 (80.9 %) instructors answered the questionnaire. RESULTS: The predominant used therapy to treat cartilage lesions is microfracture and for osteochondral lesions the osteochondral transplantation. Physiotherapy starts directly after surgery and takes more than 6 weeks. Most surgeons do not immobilize patients after surgery and use partial weight-bearing for up to 5 weeks. The change from partial to full weight-bearing is done step-wise with a 20-kg/week increase. Free ROM is allowed by the majority of instructors (55 %) directly after surgery. A CPM-device is also used directly and up to 5 weeks. Swimming and biking are allowed after 6 weeks, running is allowed after 12 weeks and contact sports after 24 weeks. Most instructors do not use braces in the aftercare procedure, but nearly all (93 %) prescribe crutches. Typical drugs used during the aftercare are NSAID, Heparin and antibiotics. For most instructors (79 % respectively 75 %) knee stability and a straight leg axis are necessary for a successful cartilage therapy. If a concomitant therapy like ACL reconstruction or an osteotomy is performed, aftercare is mainly dependent on cartilage therapy (62 % respectively 59 % of instructors). CONCLUSIONS: Today there exists no detailed rehabilitation program for treatment after a cartilage-related operation on the basis of an evidence-based level I study. The reason might be that many variables contribute to a specific aftercare procedure. Therefore, the survey of experienced surgeons may help to identify the most promising rehabilitation regime for today, at least until evidence-based level I studies are accomplished.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2009.12.030,Treatment of Chondral Defects in the Athlete's Knee,"To determine which surgical technique(s) has improved outcomes and enables athletes to return to their preinjury level of sports and which patient and defect factors significantly affect outcomes after cartilage repair or restoration.We conducted a search of multiple medical databases, evaluating studies of articular cartilage repair in athletes.We identified 11 studies for inclusion (658 subjects). Only 1 randomized clinical trial was identified. All other studies were prospective cohorts, case-control studies, or case series reporting results after either microfracture or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or osteoarticular transplantation (OATS). Eight different clinical outcomes measures were used. Better clinical outcomes were observed after ACI and OATS versus microfracture. Results after microfracture tended to deteriorate with time. The overall rate of return to preinjury level of sports was 66%. The timing of return to the preinjury level of sports was fastest after OATS and slowest after ACI. Defect size of less than 2 cm(2), preoperative duration of symptoms of less than 18 months, no prior surgical treatment, younger patient age, and higher preinjury and postsurgical level of sports all correlated with improved outcomes after cartilage repair, especially ACI. Results after microfracture were worse with larger defects. The rate of return to sports was generally lower after microfracture versus ACI or OATS, and if a patient was able to return to sports, performance was diminished as well.Management of chondral defects in the athlete is complex and multifactorial. There is little high-level evidence to support one procedure over another, although good short-term and midterm outcomes with a fair rate of return to preinjury level of sports can be achieved with cartilage repair and restoration in the athlete.Level IV, systematic review.",0
https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.26981,Increased recruitment of endogenous stem cells and chondrogenic differentiation by a composite scaffold containing bone marrow homing peptide for cartilage regeneration,"Even small cartilage defects could finally degenerate to osteoarthritis if left untreated, owing to the poor self-healing ability of articular cartilage. Stem cell transplantation has been well implemented as a common approach in cartilage tissue engineering but has technical complexity and safety concerns. The stem cell homing-based technique emerged as an alternative promising therapy for cartilage repair to overcome traditional limitations. In this study, we constructed a composite hydrogel scaffold by combining an oriented acellular cartilage matrix (ACM) with a bone marrow homing peptide (BMHP)-functionalized self-assembling peptide (SAP). We hypothesized that increased recruitment of endogenous stem cells by the composite scaffold could enhance cartilage regeneration. Methods: To test our hypothesis, in vitro proliferation, attachment and chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were tested to confirm the bioactivities of the functionalized peptide hydrogel. The composite scaffold was then implanted into full-thickness cartilage defects on rabbit knee joints for cartilage repair, in comparison with microfracture or other sample groups. Stem cell recruitment was monitored by dual labeling with CD29 and CD90 under confocal microcopy at 1 week after implantation, followed by chondrogenic differentiation examined by qRT-PCR. Repaired tissue of the cartilage defects was evaluated by histological and immunohistochemistry staining, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 and 6 months post-surgery. Macroscopic and histological scoring was done to evaluate the optimal in vivo repair outcomes of this composite scaffold. Results: The functionalized SAP hydrogels could stimulate rabbit MSC proliferation, attachment and chondrogenic differentiation during in vitro culture. At 7 days after implantation, increased recruitment of MSCs based on CD29+ /CD90+ double-positive cells was found in vivo in the composite hydrogel scaffold, as well as upregulation of cartilage-associated genes (aggrecan, Sox9 and type II collagen). After 3 and 6 months post-surgery, the articular cartilage defect in the composite scaffold-treated group was fully covered with cartilage-like tissue with a smooth surface, which was similar to the surrounding native cartilage, according to the results of histological and immunohistochemistry staining, micro-CT and MRI analysis. Macroscopic and histological scoring confirmed that the quality of cartilage repair was significantly improved with implantation of the composite scaffold at each timepoint, in comparison with microfracture or other sample groups. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the composite scaffold could enhance endogenous stem cell homing and chondrogenic differentiation and significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of chondral defects. The present study provides a promising approach for in vivo cartilage repair without cell transplantation. Optimization of this strategy may offer great potential and benefits for clinical application in the future.",0

This study investigates the effect of delivering recombinant human fibroblastic growth factor 18 (rhFHF18, Sprifermin) via a collagen membrane on the healing of a chondral defect treated with microfracture in an ovine model. Eight millimeter diameter chondral defects were created in the medial femoral condyle of 40 sheep (n = 5/treatment group). Defects were treated with microfracture alone, microfracture + intra-articular rhFGF-18 or microfracture + rhFGF-18 delivered on a membrane. Outcome measures included mechanical testing, weight bearing, International Cartilage Repair Society repair score, modified O'Driscoll score, qualitative histology, and immunohistochemistry for types I and II collagen. In animals treated with 32 μg rhFGF-18 + membrane and intra-articularly, there was a statistically significant improvement in weight bearing at 2 and 4 weeks post surgery and in the modified O'Driscoll score compared to controls. In addition, repair tissue stained was more strongly stained for type II collagen than for type I collagen. rhFGF-18 delivered via a collagen membrane at the point of surgery potentiates the healing of a microfracture treated cartilage defect.",0

In a 1-step procedure autologous BMAC and PRP was seeded onto a collagen scaffold and sutured into the debrided defect. Patients were evaluated by clinical outcome scores (IKDC [International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form], KOOS [Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score], and pain score using the Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) preoperatively, after 3 months, and after 1 and 2 years. Second-look arthroscopies were performed (n = 7) with biopsies of the repair tissue for histology. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperatively, after 1 year, and after 2 to 3.5 years with MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scores evaluating cartilage repair.After 1 year significant improvements were found in IKDC, KOOS symptoms, KOOS ADL (Activities of Daily Living), KOOS QOL (Quality of Life), and pain at activity. At the latest follow-up significant improvements were seen in IKDC, KOOS symptoms, KOOS QOL, pain at rest, and pain at activity. MRI MOCART score for cartilage repair improved significantly from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Histomorphometry of repair tissue demonstrated a mixture of fibrous tissue (58%) and fibrocartilage (40%).Treatment of cartilage injuries using combined BMAC and PRP improved subjective clinical outcome scores and pain scores at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. MRI and histology indicated repair tissue inferior to the native hyaline cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546514554190,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Implantation in Osteoarthritic Knees,"Background: The cell-based tissue engineering approach that uses mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has addressed the issue of articular cartilage repair in osteoarthritic (OA) knees. However, to improve outcomes, an advanced surgical procedure with tissue-engineered scaffolds may be needed to treat patients with large cartilage lesions. Purpose: To investigate the clinical and second-look arthroscopic outcomes of the implantation of MSCs loaded in fibrin glue as a scaffold in patients with OA knees and to compare these outcomes with those of MSC implantation without a scaffold. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study retrospectively evaluated 54 patients (56 knees) who were examined with second-look arthroscopy after MSC implantation for cartilage lesions in their OA knees. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 37 patients (39 knees) were treated with MSC implantation without a scaffold (group 1), and 17 patients (17 knees) underwent implantation of MSCs loaded in fibrin glue as a scaffold (group 2). Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and the Tegner activity scale, and cartilage repair was assessed with the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade. Statistical analyses were performed to identify various prognostic factors associated with the clinical and second-look arthroscopic outcomes. Results: At final follow-up (mean, 28.6 months; range, 24-34 months), the mean IKDC score and Tegner activity scale in each group significantly improved: group 1, from 38.1 ± 7.7 to 62.0 ± 11.7 (IKDC) and from 2.5 ± 0.9 to 3.5 ± 0.8 (Tegner); group 2, from 36.1 ± 6.2 to 64.4 ± 11.5 (IKDC) and from 2.2 ± 0.8 to 3.8 ± 0.8 (Tegner) ( P &lt; .001 for all). According to the overall ICRS cartilage repair grades, 9 of the 39 lesions (23%) in group 1 and 12 of the 17 lesions (58%) in group 2 achieved a grade of I or II. There was a significant difference in ICRS grades between the groups ( P = .028). Overweight (body mass index ≥ 27.5 kg/m 2 ) and large lesion size (≥5.7 cm 2 ) were significant predictors of poor clinical and arthroscopic outcomes in group 1 ( P &lt; .05 for both). There was a similar trend in group 2, but the differences were not significant, possibly owing to the smaller sample size. Conclusion: Clinical and arthroscopic outcomes of MSC implantation were encouraging for OA knees in both groups, although there were no significant differences in outcome scores between groups. However, at second-look arthroscopy, there were better ICRS grades in group 2.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-015-3536-5,"The use of autologous adult, allogenic juvenile, and combined juvenile–adult cartilage fragments for the repair of chondral defects","The goal of the study was to evaluate the repair of chondral lesions treated with combined autologous adult/allogenic juvenile cartilage fragments, compared with isolated adult and isolated juvenile cartilage fragments.Fifty-eight adult (>16 week old) and five juvenile (<6 week old) New Zealand White female rabbits were used. A large osteochondral defect was created in the center of the femoral trochlea of adult rabbits. The rabbits were divided in four groups: Group 1 = untreated defects (controls); Group 2 = adult cartilage fragments; Group 3 = juvenile cartilage fragments; and Group 4 = adult + juvenile cartilage fragments. Killings were performed at 3 and 6 months. The defects were evaluated with ICRS macroscopic score, modified O'Driscoll score, and Collagen type II immunostaining.At 3 months, Group 4 performed better than Group 1, in terms of modified O'Driscoll score (p = 0.001) and Collagen type II immunostaining (p = 0.015). At 6 months, Group 4 showed higher modified O'Driscoll score (p = 0.003) and Collagen type II immunostaining score (p < 0.001) than Group 1. Histologically, also Group 3 performed better than Group 1 (p = 0.03), and Group 4 performed better than Group 2 (p = 0.004).Mixing adult and juvenile cartilage fragments improved cartilage repair in a rabbit model. In the clinical setting, a new ""one-stage"" procedure combining the two cartilage sources can be hypothesized, with the advantages of improved chondral repair and large defect coverage, because of the use of an off-the-shelf juvenile allograft. Further studies on larger animals and clinical trials are required to confirm these results.",0

Purpose: To identify which factors may predict decreased graft survival after ACI among patients who underwent a prior MST. A secondary aim was to investigate the specificity of these predictors. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In this review of prospectively collected data, the authors analyzed 38 patients who had failed prior MST surgery and subsequently underwent collagen-covered ACI (case group). The case group was divided into graft failure ACI (n = 8, 21%) and successful ACI (n = 30, 79%). Fourteen clinical variables were categorized and analyzed to determine predictors for failure of the ACI graft: age, body mass index, sex, defect characteristics (number, size, location, etiology, type), presence of kissing lesion, intraoperative presence of intralesional osteophyte, time between an MST and ACI, previous surgery, duration of the symptoms, and concomitant surgical procedure. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the severity of subchondral bone marrow edema (BME), graded I (absent) to IV (severe), and the presence of subchondral cyst, hypertrophic sclerosis, and intralesional osteophyte. The effects of these MRI findings on the graft survivor were also investigated. Concurrently, a control group without a prior MST was matched to investigate the specificity of the previously determined predictors. These patients were matched individually according to age, sex, body mass index, and outcome of the procedure (failure [n = 8] or successful [n = 30] per the case group). Results: In the case group, the presence of preoperative severe BME was significantly higher among patients with failed ACI as compared with patients with successful ACI ( P &lt; .001). In the control group, the presence of severe BME was not significantly different between the failure and successful groups ( P = .747). The ACI graft failure rate among patients with a prior MST and preoperative grade IV BME was 83.7% at 5 years postoperatively, resulting in a significantly lower survival rate as compared with patients with a prior MST and without severe BME (5-year graft failure rate, 6.5%; P &lt; .001). All the other parameters did not differ significantly. Conclusion: After a prior MST, the presence of grade IV BME by MRI was a predictive factor for graft failure among patients who then underwent second-generation ACI.",1

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are increasingly applied as noninvasive biomarkers to assess the biochemical composition of cartilage repair tissue. Purpose: To evaluate the association of quantitative MRI parameters of cartilage repair tissue and subchondral bone marrow with magnetic resonance morphologic and clinical outcomes after MACI with ABG of the knee. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Qualitative and quantitative 3 T MRI of the knee was performed in 21 patients (16 male) at 2.5 years after MACI with ABG at the medial (18/21) or lateral (3/21) femoral condyle for the treatment of osteochondral defects. Morphologic MRI sequences were assessed using MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) 2.0 scores. T2 relaxation time measurements for the assessment of cartilage repair tissue (CRT2) were obtained. Single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in underlying subchondral bone marrow (BM) and at both central femoral condyles. The presence of pain and Tegner scores were noted. Statistical analyses included Student t tests, correlation analyses, and multivariate regression models. Results: The mean defect size was 4.9 ± 1.9 cm 2 . At a follow-up of 2.5 ± 0.3 years, 9 of 21 patients were asymptomatic. Perfect defect filling was achieved in 66.7% (14/21) of patients. MOCART 2.0 scores (74.1 ± 18.4) did not indicate pain (68.3 ± 19.0 [pain] vs 81.7 ± 15.4 [no pain]; P = .102). However, knee pain was present in 85.7% (6/7) of patients with deep bony defects (odds ratio, 8.0; P = .078). Relative CRT2 was higher in hypertrophic cartilage repair tissue than in repair tissue with normal filling (1.54 ± 0.42 vs 1.13 ± 0.21, respectively; P = .022). The underlying BM edema–like lesion (BMEL) volume was larger in patients with underfilling compared with patients with perfect defect filling (1.87 ± 1.32 vs 0.31 ± 0.51 cm 3 , respectively; P = .002). Patients with severe pain showed a higher BMEL volume (1.2 ± 1.3 vs 0.2 ± 0.4 cm 3 , respectively; P = .046) and had a higher BM water fraction (26.0% ± 12.3% vs 8.6% ± 8.1%, respectively; P = .026) than did patients without pain. Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative MRI parameters including the presence of subchondral defects, CRT2, BMEL volume, and BM water fraction were correlated with cartilage repair tissue quality and clinical symptoms. Therefore, the integrity of subchondral bone was associated with outcomes after osteochondral transplantation.",0

The results of mosaicplasty were prospectively evaluated at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and yearly with patient-reported outcomes measures and radiographs. Results: Slight or moderate degenerative changes (Fairbank grade I or II) were detected preoperatively in 27% of the cases and in 36% of the cases at follow-up. Fairbank grade III changes were observed in 5 cases. An average radiographic deterioration of 0.32 on the Fairbank scale was detected (preoperative, 0.34; postoperative, 0.66). Good to excellent results were found in 91% of femoral mosaicplasties, 86% of tibial, and 74% of patellofemoral; 92% of talar mosaicplasties had similar results (Hannover ankle scoring system). Patellofemoral pain related to graft harvest was observed in 5% of cases. Second-look arthroscopies revealed good, congruent, gliding surfaces of the transplants and acceptable fibrocartilage coverage of donor sites in 16 patients and degenerative changes of the transplants in 5 cases. Histological evaluation revealed good graft incorporation in all 11 cases. Two infections and 3 deep venous thromboses occurred. Conclusion: Despite a higher rate of preoperative osteoarthritic changes in the athletic patients, clinical outcomes of mosaicplasty in this group demonstrated a success rate similar to that of less athletic patients. Higher motivation resulted in better subjective evaluation. Slight deterioration in results occurred during the 9.6-year follow-up; thus, autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty may be a useful alternative for the treatment of 1.0- to 4.0-cm 2 focal chondral and osteochondral lesions in competitive athletes.",0

Each specimen then underwent micro-fracture using a needle. Two weeks after surgery, 3 groups were randomly formed among the rats (n = 33). In Group 1, 0.2 mL of sterile saline solution (0.9%) was injected. In Group 2, 0.2 mL HA with a mean molecular weight of 1.2 Mda was injected. In Group 3, 0.2 mL of HA-CS-NAG compound (hyaluronate, sodium chondroitin sulfate, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine) was injected. The injections were applied on the 14th, the 21st and the 28th postoperative days. All rats were sacrificed on the 42nd postoperative day. Histological analysis of the repair tissue was performed for each specimen by two blinded observers using Wakitani scoring system.There was significantly improved repair tissue in both Group 3 and Group 2 when compared with Group 1. Group 3 showed statistically significant improvement in terms of 'cell morphology' and 'integration of donor with host' when compared to Group 2 (p < 0.001).Intra-articular injection of HA-CS-NAG compound after micro-fracture results in significantly improved repair tissue in rats' chondral defects when compared to HA regarding the donor integration and cell morphology.",0

Materials and Methods: We prospectively followed up for 2 years 15 patients (mean age, 48 years) who were operated for grade IV cartilage lesions of the knee. Six of the patients had multiple chondral lesions; the average size of the lesions was 9.2 cm 2 . All patients underwent a mini-arthrotomy and concomitant transplantation with BMAC covered with the collagen matrix. Coexisting pathologies were treated before or during the same surgery. X-rays and MRI were collected preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years’ follow-up. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm, Marx, SF-36 (physical/mental), and Tegner scores were collected preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months’ follow-up. Four patients gave their consent for second-look arthroscopy and 3 of them for a concomitant biopsy. Results: Patients showed significant improvement in all scores at final follow-up ( P &lt; 0.005). Patients presenting single lesions and patients with small lesions showed higher improvement. MRI showed coverage of the lesion with hyaline-like tissue in all patients in accordance with clinical results. Hyaline-like histological findings were also reported for all the specimens analyzed. No adverse reactions or postoperative complications were noted. Conclusion: This study showed that 1-step surgery with BMAC and collagen I/III matrix could be a viable technique in the treatment of grade IV knee chondral lesions.",0

Microfractures and debridement are recommended for the initial treatment because they are low-risk arthroscopic procedures with a high success rate. Perichondral autografts, periosteal autografts, plug autografts, autologous chondrocyte implantation, or osteotomy should be reserved for revision chondral surgery because they are higher-risk procedures. Their success rate is approximately the same as that of the low-risk arthroscopic procedures.",0

Whereas microfracture and autologous chondrocyte implantation yield good results on femoral condyles, the therapeutic state of the art for treating patellofemoral lesions is yet to be determined. In this study, we compared the CaReS technique, which is a matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation technique, to microfracture for treating patellofemoral articular cartilage lesions.Between May 2003 and December 2005, 17 patients with an isolated patellofemoral cartilage defect (International Cartilage Repair Society III/IV) were treated with the CaReS technique at our department. After adjusting for inclusion and exclusion criteria, ten of these patients could be included in this study; ten patients treated with microfracture were chosen as a matched-pair group. Clinical outcome was evaluated 3 years after surgery by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective evaluation of the knee, Lysholm Score, and Cincinnati Modified Rating Scale scores.Patients treated with CaReS had statistically significantly improved IKDC, Lysholm, and Cincinnati scores 36 months after surgery compared with preoperatively. When comparing outcome between groups 36 months after surgery, there was no statistically difference in IKDC, Lysholm, and Cincinnati scores.This is the first trial comparing the CaReS technique and microfracture for treating patellofemoral articular cartilage lesions, and results show that CaReS(®) yields comparable results to microfracture. The small number of patients is a limiting factor of the study, leading to results without statistical significance. A multicentric prospective randomized study comparing the two procedures is desirable.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.119821,Decellularized tissue engineered hyaline cartilage graft for articular cartilage repair,"Articular cartilage repair has been a long-standing challenge in orthopaedic medicine due to the limited self-regenerative capability of cartilage tissue. Currently, cartilage lesions are often treated by microfracture or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). However, these treatments are frequently reported to result in a mixture of the desired hyaline cartilage and mechanically inferior fibrocartilage. In this study, by combining the advantages of cartilage tissue engineering and decellularization technology, we developed a decellularized allogeneic hyaline cartilage graft, named dLhCG, which achieved superior efficacy in articular cartilage repair and surpassed living autologous chondrocyte-based cartilaginous engraftment and ACI. By the 6-month time point after implantation in porcine knee joints, the fine morphology, composition, phenotype, microstructure and mechanical properties of the regenerated hyaline-like cartilaginous neo-tissue have been demonstrated via histology, biochemical assays, DNA microarrays and mechanical tests. The articular cartilaginous engraftment with allogeneic dLhCG was indicated to be well consistent, compatible and integrated with the native cartilage of the host. The successful repair of articular chondral defects in large animal models suggests the readiness of allogeneic dLhCG for clinical trials.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2018.11.004,Management of loose osteochondritis dissecans in an adolescent,"Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee joint affects subchondral bone first, and then it involves the articular cartilage. It can cause pain, effusion and loose body formation. Nonoperative treatment is for the stable lesion, but if the lesion is unstable and symptomatic, then operative management is needed. Short term goal of the treatment is pain relief, and the long-term goal is the prevention of early arthritis. Surgical treatment includes removal of loose body, microfractures, osteochondral autograft and allograft transplantation, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), arthroscopic removal of the loose body and internal fixation of the fragment using k wire or screw. We successfully managed an adolescent with a loose OCD fragment with an arthroscopic evaluation, removal of the loose body and refixation of the loose fragment to the parent location, using three bio screws.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.st.17.00066,Open Implantation of Autologous Chondrocytes Cultured on Porcine Collagen Membrane for the Treatment of a Full-Thickness Patellar Cartilage Lesion,"Large cartilage defects in the knee are debilitating for patients and challenging for surgeons to treat. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has gained popularity over the past 20 years and has become the treatment of choice for large cartilage defects for some surgeons. Termed matrix-applied ACI (MACI), use of autologous chondrocytes cultured on porcine collagen membrane has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic full-thickness cartilage defects in the knee. This new technique for cartilage repair is the third generation of chondrocyte implantation technology and the first to involve the use of a scaffolding to grow chondrocytes1. MACI is a simpler technique than previous generations and has more reliable chondrocyte seeding. Research has shown that patients do well postoperatively, with improvements in patient-reported outcome out to 5 years postoperatively3. These improvements are statistically greater for patients who underwent MACI when compared to those who underwent microfracture2. (1) Preoperative evaluation: patients are indicated for a cartilage procedure after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical examination. (2) Stage 1: a diagnostic arthroscopy is performed, and chondrocytes are harvested and cultured. (3) Approach: a short vertical incision is made, followed by a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. (4) Debridement: the lesion is identified and debrided back to stable cartilage. (5): Hemostasis: hemostasis is obtained with an epinephrine-soaked sponge. (6) Template creation: foil is used to create a template of the lesion. (7) Cells cutting: with use of the foil, the membrane of cells is cut to the appropriate size and shape. (8) Implantation: the cut membrane is placed on the lesion and secured with fibrin glue. (9) Testing: the knee is taken through a range of motion and the stability of the membrane is confirmed. (10) Closure: standard closure in layers is performed.",0

Although low bone density may be present concurrently, it is not the underlying cause of subchondral insufficiency fractures in the majority of patients. Patients with subchondral insufficiency fracture characteristically have unremarkable plain radiographs, while MRI examination may reveal extensive bone marrow oedema and subchondral bone collapse. This article presents a 51-year-old postmenopausal woman, a physician, who had subchondral insufficiency fractures of the knee associated with prolonged standing during clinical work. She was treated with partial weight bearing on crutches until 14 months after the injury, viscosupplementation at 4 months to treat osteoarthritis and teriparatide treatment to improve bone healing at 7 months. By 26 months after the injury, she tolerated independent walking with a fabric knee support but still experienced mild posterolateral knee pain and numbness on prolonged standing.",0
https://doi.org/10.2519/jospt.2006.2228,Current Concepts in the Rehabilitation Following Articular Cartilage Repair Procedures in the Knee,"Postoperative rehabilitation programs following articular cartilage repair procedures will vary greatly among patients and need to be individualized based on the nature of the lesion, the unique characteristics of the patient, and the type and detail of each surgical procedure. These programs are based on knowledge of the basic science, anatomy, and biomechanics of articular cartilage as well as the biological course of healing following surgery. The goal is to restore full function in each patient as quickly as possible by facilitating a healing response without overloading the healing articular cartilage. The purpose of this paper is to overview the principles of rehabilitation following articular cartilage repair procedures. Furthermore, specific rehabilitation guidelines for debridement, abrasion chondroplasty, microfracture, osteochondral autograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation will be presented based upon our current understanding of the biological healing response postoperatively.",0

We developed a biphasic cylindrical osteochondral composite construct for such use, and conducted this study to determine its feasibility for treating osteochondral lesions in human knees.Ten patients with symptomatic osteochondral lesions at femoral condyles were treated by replacing pathological tissue with the construct of dl-poly-lactide-co-glycolide, whose lower body was impregnated with β-tricalcium phosphate and served as osseous phase. The construct had a chamber to load double-minced autologous cartilage, serving as source of chondrocytes. Osteochondral lesion was drill-fashioned a pit of identical dimension as the construct. Chondrocyte-laden construct was press-fit to fill the pit. Postoperative outcome was evaluated using Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) scale up to 24 months. Magnetic resonance image was taken, and sample tissue was collected with second-look arthroscopic needle biopsy at 12 months. Outcome parameters were primarily safety of surgery, and secondarily postoperative change in KOOS and regeneration of hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone.No patient experienced serious adverse events. Postoperative mean KOOS in ""symptoms"" subscale had not changed significantly from pre-operation until 24 months; whereas those in the other four subscales were significantly higher than pre-operation at 12 and 24 months. Second-look arthroscopy showed completely filled grafted sites, with regenerate cartilaginous surfaces flushed with surrounding native joint surface. Microscopically, regenerated cartilage appeared hyaline.This novel construct for chondrocyte implantation is safe for surgical application in knee. It repairs osteochondral lesions of femoral condyles by successful regeneration of hyaline cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-013-2275-9,The effect of platelet-rich plasma on osteochondral defects treated with mosaicplasty,"This study investigated the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on articular surfaces on which the mosaicplasty technique was performed. Our hypothesis was that PRP can accelerate the osseointegration process and enhance the quality of articular integrity after the mosaicplasty procedure.Standard defects were created in the femoral groove of both patellofemoral joints of 12 New Zealand rabbits. PRP solution was placed inside the defect before fixation of the osteochondral autografts and injected inside the involved joint after capsular closure of the tested knees. The contralateral knees served as the control sides. The animals were euthanized three or six weeks after mosaicplasty, and both limbs were assessed according to Pineda's histological grading scale. Significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05 a priori, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis.Histologic findings at the interface between the transferred autograft and the original cartilage revealed better integration of the adjacent surfaces in the mosaicplasty with PRP group three weeks after the procedure; the difference was significant (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference in the transition zone was observed between the groups six weeks after the experiment (p = 0.59).Our animal model showed that adjunctive use of PRP produced a better healing response and resulted in superior histological scores after three weeks compared with the mosaicplasty-only procedure. Interpretation of our results is important in terms of rapid return to previous activity levels. Thus, application of PRP can represent a valid therapeutic option for improving the efficacy of mosaicplasty by stimulating the local healing response.",0

MRI was performed 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The clinical status was determined using International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Form (IKDC). Correlations of MOCART 2.0 parameters and Delta IKDC scores were quantified by nonparametric Spearman's R. Those parameters with significant correlations (p < 0.05) were screened for their ability to predict a clinical outcome of Delta IKDC ≥ 20 at 12 months.Significant correlations were identified for the parameters MOCART total 6 months (p < 0.05), Surface 6 months (p < 0.05), Surface 12 months (p < 0.05), Structure 6 months (p < 0.01), Structure 12 months (p < 0.05), Subchondral changes 3 months (p < 0.0001), Subchondral changes 6 months (p < 0.05) and Subchondral changes 12 months (p < 0.05). Among all MRI score parameters, Subchondral changes 3 months achieved the highest accuracy of 0.76 (0.62-0.86) in predicting Delta IKDC ≥ 20 after 12 months.Some of the MOCART 2.0 parameters show significant correlation with Delta IKDC scores in the postoperative course after retropatellar MACT, which seems to depend on the time interval between surgery and MRI acquisition.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1692-9,A novel nano-structured porous polycaprolactone scaffold improves hyaline cartilage repair in a rabbit model compared to a collagen type I/III scaffold: in vitro and in vivo studies,"To develop a nano-structured porous polycaprolactone (NSP-PCL) scaffold and compare the articular cartilage repair potential with that of a commercially available collagen type I/III (Chondro-Gide(A (R))) scaffold. By combining rapid prototyping and thermally induced phase separation, the NSP-PCL scaffold was produced for matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation. Lyophilizing a water-dioxane-PCL solution created micro and nano-pores. In vitro: The scaffolds were seeded with rabbit chondrocytes and cultured in hypoxia for 6 days. qRT-PCR was performed using primers for sox9, aggrecan, collagen type 1 and 2. In vivo: 15 New Zealand White Rabbits received bilateral osteochondral defects in the femoral intercondylar grooves. Autologous chondrocytes were harvested 4 weeks prior to surgery. There were 3 treatment groups: (1) NSP-PCL scaffold without cells. (2) The Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold with autologous chondrocytes and (3) NSP-PCL scaffold with autologous chondrocytes. Observation period was 13 weeks. Histological evaluation was made using the O'Driscoll score. In vitro: The expressions of sox9 and aggrecan were higher in the NSP-PCL scaffold, while expression of collagen 1 was lower compared to the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold. In vivo: Both NSP-PCL scaffolds with and without cells scored significantly higher than the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold when looking at the structural integrity and the surface regularity of the repair tissue. No differences were found between the NSP-PCL scaffold with and without cells. The NSP-PCL scaffold demonstrated higher in vitro expression of chondrogenic markers and had higher in vivo histological scores compared to the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold. The improved chondrocytic differentiation can potentially produce more hyaline cartilage during clinical cartilage repair. It appears to be a suitable cell-free implant for hyaline cartilage repair and could provide a less costly and more effective treatment option than the Chondro-Gide(A (R)) scaffold with cells.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2011.06.002,Evaluation of Intra-Articular Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Augment Healing of Microfractured Chondral Defects,"This study evaluated intra-articular injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to augment healing with microfracture compared with microfracture alone.Ten horses (aged 2.5 to 5 years) had 1-cm2 defects arthroscopically created on both medial femoral condyles of the stifle joint (analogous to the human knee). Defects were debrided to subchondral bone followed by microfracture. One month later, 1 randomly selected medial femorotibial joint in each horse received an intra-articular injection of either 20 × 10(6) BMSCs with 22 mg of hyaluronan or 22 mg of hyaluronan alone. Horses were confined for 4 months, with hand walking commencing at 2 weeks and then increasing in duration and intensity. At 4 months, horses were subjected to strenuous treadmill exercise simulating race training until completion of the study at 12 months. Horses underwent musculoskeletal and radiographic examinations bimonthly and second-look arthroscopy at 6 months. Horses were euthanized 12 months after the defects were made, and the affected joints underwent magnetic resonance imaging and gross, histologic, histomorphometric, immunohistochemical, and biochemical examinations.Although there was no evidence of any clinically significant improvement in the joints injected with BMSCs, arthroscopic and gross evaluation confirmed a significant increase in repair tissue firmness and a trend for better overall repair tissue quality (cumulative score of all arthroscopic and gross grading criteria) in BMSC-treated joints. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly greater levels of aggrecan in repair tissue treated with BMSC injection. There were no other significant treatment effects.Although there was no significant difference clinically or histologically in the 2 groups, this study confirms that intra-articular BMSCs enhance cartilage repair quality with increased aggrecan content and tissue firmness.Clinical use of BMSCs in conjunction with microfracture of cartilage defects may be potentially beneficial.",0

Although this approach is reasonable, continuing advances in the field of cartilage repair will further expand the options available to improve outcomes. In the present clinical study, we compared the outcomes of matrix-induced autologous mesenchymal stem cell implantation (m-AMI) with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (m-ACI) for the treatment of isolated chondral defects of the knee. Prospective, single-site, randomized, single-blind pilot study. Fourteen patients with isolated full-thickness chondral lesions of the knee \textbackslashtextgreater 2 cm(2) were randomized into two treatment groups: m-AMI and m-ACI. Outcomes were assessed pre-operatively and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. Clinical evaluations revealed that improvement from pre-operation to 24 months post-operation occurred in both groups (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). At all follow-up intervals, m-AMI demonstrated significantly better functional outcomes (motion deficit and straight leg raise strength) than did m-ACI (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). At all follow-up intervals, m-AMI demonstrated significantly better subjective sub-scale scores for pain, symptoms, activities of daily living and sport and recreation of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) than did m-ACI (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Additionally, m-AMI demonstrated significantly better (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05) scores than m-ACI for the quality of life sub-scale of the KOOS and visual analog scale (VAS) severity at the 6-month follow-up. The Tegner activity score and VAS frequency were not significantly different between the two groups. Graft failure was not observed on magnetic resonance imaging at the 24-month follow-up. m-AMI and m-ACI demonstrated very good-to-excellent and good-to-very good infill, respectively, with no adverse effects from the implant, regardless of the treatment. For the treatment of isolated full-thickness chondral lesion of the knee, m-AMI can be used effectively and may potentially accelerate recovery. A larger patient cohort and follow-up supported by histological analyses are necessary to determine long-term outcomes.",1
https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.st.20.00028,Porcine-Derived Collagen-Augmented Chondrogenesis Technique for Treating Knee Cartilage Defects,"Articular cartilage is virtually incapable of self-healing in the event of a defect. Microfracture is the most frequently used bone marrow stimulation technique1, but there is the limitation of unpredictable quality of the cartilage repair following bone marrow stimulation2. To resolve the shortcomings of the microfracture technique, various reinforcing technologies have been developed, including the porcine-derived collagen-augmented chondrogenesis technique (C-ACT)3. The collagen gel utilized in that procedure is a product called CartiFill (Sewon Cellontech), made from highly purified pig-derived type-I collagen. It has been modified into an atelocollagen, by removing telopeptides, to virtually eliminate the risk of rejection. The collagen matrix provides not only a 3-dimensional structure for cartilage differentiation, but also mechanical support3,4.Porcine-derived C-ACT is initiated by creating a mixture of atelocollagen, thrombin, and fibrinogen. First, thrombin is mixed with atelocollagen and placed in one arm of an assembled Y-shaped syringe, and fibrinogen is placed in the other arm. The articular cartilage defect site is confirmed in a routine arthroscopic procedure. The articular margin is debrided, and the calcified lesion is cleanly removed. Then, microfractures are created. After creating a more extended incision at the anteromedial portal, the microfracture site is prepared by removing moisture. The prepared atelocollagen mixture is applied to the defect site as a single layer, although a second layer can be formed 1 to 2 minutes later. After 5 minutes, the stability is verified by range of motion of the knee.Indications for this procedure include (1) cartilage defects in the knee, including knee osteoarthritis and knee traumatic arthritis; (2) knee osteoarthritis with a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 3 or less; (3) hip-knee-ankle malalignment of <5° or a deformity that is able to be surgically corrected; and (4) knee stability, or instability that is able to be surgically corrected.Contraindications for this procedure include (1) patient or family history of autoimmune disease, (2) history of anaphylactic reaction, (3) history of hypersensitivity to an implant, (4) history of allergy to porcine or bovine protein, and (5) inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid and gouty arthritis.C-ACT is a procedure for cartilage repair, and the effects of this procedure can be limited in cases with a deep subchondral bone defect; however, there is no limit to the size of the cartilage defect in terms of patient selection for C-ACT.There are several alternatives to C-ACT, ranging from the simple microfracture technique to autologous chondrocyte implantation5, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation6, autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis7, osteochondral autograft transplantation8, and stem cell therapy. There are various ways to recover from an articular cartilage defect, but C-ACT does not require a 2-stage technique, as is necessary with both autologous chondrocyte implantation procedures. Therefore, C-ACT has the advantages of ease of operation and being a single-stage procedure3,9.C-ACT can be classified as an upgraded version of microfracture, which is the most common treatment method for articular cartilage defects. With the microfracture technique, repaired cartilage is limited to fibrous cartilage and does not include hyaline cartilage3,4. However, a recent study reported that C-ACT exhibited a superior quality of repaired cartilage compared with microfracture3,4.Previous studies have reported favorable results with the use of C-ACT3,4. Kim et al.4 compared atelocollagen augmentation with microfracture alone in patients undergoing medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis. Although there was no clinical difference between the 2 groups, the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score and the International Cartilage Repair Society II score were superior in the atelocollagen augmentation group. In addition, the microfracture group formed fibrous-like cartilage compared with the hyaline-like cartilage created in the atelocollagen augmentation group. A recent multicenter randomized study compared the use of C-ACT and microfracture and found that C-ACT exhibited significantly better results in several MOCART subscores and quantitative T2 mapping, indicating a histologically superior form of repaired cartilage compared with microfracture3. According to recent research, microfracture is superior to autologous chondrocyte implantation in terms of cost-effectiveness10. Similar results appear to be applicable to C-ACT. C-ACT requires an additional $1,300 for material costs; however, C-ACT showed better cartilage regeneration on magnetic resonance imagining and histology3,4, and higher rate of patients meeting the 20%-improvement rate in visual analogue scale pain scores at 24 months postoperatively compared with microfracture3. Long-term studies will be needed to assess whether histological superiority of C-ACT is reflected in meaningful improvements to clinical outcomes.Debride all of the damaged cartilage to subchondral bone and remove the calcified layer without interfering with tissue repairTake special care when creating the atelocollagen mixture to ensure that it is accurately manufacturedDry the defect site with use of suction or gauze to aid in atelocollagen adhesion when applying atelocollagen.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/jsa.0b013e31818cdbc5,Second Generation Issues in Cartilage Repair,"In recent years, regenerative techniques, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), have emerged as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of chondral lesions. However, the good results reported have to be weighed against the number of problems that can be observed with traditional ACI methods. To address these problems, the so-called second generation ACI techniques have been developed. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation on a 3-dimensional matrix was introduced in clinical practice from 1998 to 1999 and results at short to medium-term follow-up are well documented for different types of scaffolds. These techniques may be used for the treatment of large chondral lesions in the young, active population and highly competitive athletes, but long-term and randomized controlled studies will be needed to confirm reliability of these procedures.",0

The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual histological assessment scale was used for histological assessment. Biopsied tissue was immunohistochemically analyzed with the use of monoclonal antihuman collagen type I and monoclonal antihuman collagen type II primary antibodies. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentrations in biopsied reparative cartilage samples were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MR imaging was performed with T1- and T2-weighted imaging and three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled (3D-SPGR) MR imaging.Four tissue samples were graded as having a mixed morphology of hyaline and fibrocartilage while the other two were graded as fibrocartilage. Average ICRS scores for each criterion were (I) 1.0 +/- 1.5; (II) 1.7 +/- 0.5; (III) 0.6 +/- 1.0; (IV) 3.0 +/- 0.0; (V) 1.8 +/- 1.5; and (VI) 2.5 +/- 1.2. Average total score was 10.7 +/- 2.8. On immunohistochemical analysis, the matrix from deep and middle layers of reparative cartilage stained positive for type II collagen; however, the surface layer did not stain well. The average GAG concentration in reparative cartilage was 76.6 +/- 4.2 microg/mg whereas that in normal cartilage was 108 +/- 11.2 microg/mg. Common complications observed on 3D-SPGR MR imaging were hypertrophy of grafted periosteum, edema-like signal in bone marrow, and incomplete repair of subchondral bone at the surgical site. Clinically, patients had significant improvements in Lysholm scores.In spite of a good clinical course, reparative cartilage after ACI had less GAG concentration and was inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in histological and immunohistochemical appearance and on MRI findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.22203/ecm.v022a21,Transplantation of scaffold-free spheroids composed of synovium-derived cells and chondrocytes for the treatment of cartilage defects of the knee,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is the treatment of choice for osteoarthritis. However, to regenerate articular cartilage using this method, the procedure paradoxically demands that the cell source of the articular chondrocytes (ACs) for ex vivo expansion be from the patient's own healthy cartilage, which can result in donor site morbidity. Accordingly, it is essential to develop a substitute for AC. In the present study, we investigated whether synovium-derived cells (SYs) could be used as a partial replacement for ACs in ACI. ACs and SYs from the knees of rabbits were isolated and cultured, and the growth rates of the cells were compared. To manufacture the cellular transplants, we developed a high-density suspension-shaking culture method (HDSS), which circulates the cells in culture media, promoting self-assembly of scaffold-free cellular aggregates. ACs and SYs were mixed in various ratios using HDSS. Injectable cellular transplants were harvested and transplanted into full-thickness osteochondral defects. Simultaneously, histological evaluations were conducted with toluidine blue and safranin O, and immunohistochemistry of collagen type I and II was conducted. Gene expression to evaluate chondrocyte-specific differentiation was also performed. We successfully prepared a large quantity of spheroids (spheroidal cell aggregates) in a short time using mixed ACs and SYs, for all cellular composition ratios. Our data showed that the minimal therapeutic unit for the transplants contributed to in situ regeneration of cartilage. In summary, SYs can be used as a replacement for ACs in clinical cases of ACI in patients with broad areas of osteoarthritic lesions.",0

A 12-week structured rehabilitation program was undertaken by all patients. Patients underwent clinical assessment (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Short Form 36 Health Survey, visual analog pain scale, 6-minute walk test, knee range of motion) before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment at 3, 12, and 24 months after surgery. MRI evaluation assessed 8 previously defined pertinent parameters of graft repair, as well as a combined MRI composite score.A significant improvement (P < .05) was shown throughout the postoperative time line for all Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales, the physical component score of the Short Form 36 Health Survey, the frequency and severity of knee pain, and the 6-minute walk test. An improvement in pertinent morphologic parameters of graft repair was observed to 24 months, whereas a good to excellent graft infill score and MRI composite score were observed at 24 months after surgery in 90% and 70% of patients, respectively.We report a comprehensive 24-month follow-up in the first 20 patients who underwent the arthroscopic MACI technique. This technique is a safe and efficacious procedure with improved clinical and radiologic outcomes over the 2-year period.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2018.06.003,Use of Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate with Acetabular Labral Repair for the Management of Chondrolabral Junction Breakdown,"Despite advances in techniques for acetabular labral repair, strategies for mitigating or reversing damage to the chondrolabral junction do not yet exist. Cartilage repair techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft transfer, microfracture, and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) have all been suggested to restore joint congruity and minimize further chondral deterioration. However, chondrocyte implantation techniques and osteochondral grafts are technically challenging in the hip because of its constrained nature, and many cell-based therapies have shown suboptimal results near the chondrolabral junction because of the increased shear forces at the peripheral acetabulum and increased stress at the weight-bearing region of the joint. By using BMAC to augment labral repairs and coat chondrolabral junction breakdown, we are able to introduce mesenchymal stem cells to peripheral acetabular tissue with little to no drawbacks, while avoiding donor-site morbidity, open procedures, and multiple surgeries. The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe a reproducible method for harvesting, processing, and applying BMAC to the chondrolabral surface of the hip during hip arthroscopy without the need for donor-site morbidity or increased labral repair time.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2020.12.224,"Editorial Commentary: Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus: All, Nothing, or Something in Between","Osteochondral lesions of the talus occur with relatively frequency, often as the sequelae of benign ankle sprains, and are only surpassed by the knee and elbow as more common locations. While microfracture of the talus is the most common first-line surgical treatment performed at the time of ankle arthroscopy, marrow stimulation alone results in fibrocartilaginous repair tissue rather than true hyaline-like articular cartilage. In addition, the benefits of bone marrow stimulation for the treatment of large (>150 mm2), deep (>7 mm), or cystic lesions is limited. Autologous osteochondral transplant has emerged as one such treatment option for large lesions that may address underlying bone loss and reconstitute articular cartilage. The utility of autologous osteochondral transplant also must be interpreted with an understanding of the potential complications, including donor-site morbidity. In addition, it is important to decompress, curettage, and back fill associated cysts with bone graft. When cysts are not treated aggressively, patients may have ongoing bone marrow edema and pain.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13183029,"Safety and Efficacy of Kartigen® in Treating Cartilage Defects: A Randomized, Controlled, Phase I Trial","Here, we aimed to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Kartigen®, a matrix with autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived chondrocyte precursors embedded in atelocollagen. As a surgical graft, Kartigen® was implanted onto the cartilage defects at the weight-bearing site of the medial femoral condyle of the knee. Fifteen patients were enrolled and stratified into two groups, undergoing either Kartigen® implantation (n = 10) or microfracture (control group, n = 5). The primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety of Kartigen® by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events through physician queries, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and radiological analyses for 2 years. There were no infections, inflammations, adhesions, loose body, or tumor formations in the Kartigen®-implanted knees. The preliminary efficacy was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, visual analog scale, and second-look arthroscopy. The postoperative IKDC scores of the Kartigen® group significantly improved in the 16th week (IKDC = 62.1 ± 12.8, p = 0.025), kept increasing in the first year (IKDC = 78.2 ± 15.4, p &lt; 0.005), and remained satisfactory in the second year (IKDC = 73.6 ± 13.8, p &lt; 0.005), compared to the preoperative condition (IKDC = 47.1 ± 17.0), while the postoperative IKDC scores of the control group also achieved significant improvement in the 28th week (IKDC = 68.5 ± 6.1, p = 0.032) versus preoperative state (IKDC = 54.0 ± 9.1). However, the IKDC scores decreased in the first year (IKDC = 63.5 ± 11.6) as well as in the second year (IKDC = 52.6 ± 16.4). Thirteen patients underwent second-look arthroscopy and biopsy one year after the operation. The Kartigen® group exhibited integration between Kartigen® and host tissue with a smooth appearance at the recipient site, whereas the microfracture group showed fibrillated surfaces. The histological and immunohistochemical analyses of biopsy specimens demonstrated the columnar structure of articular cartilage and existence of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycan mimic hyaline cartilage. This study indicates that Kartigen® is safe and effective in treating cartilage defects.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603510366028,Hip Microfracture,"Microfracture is a marrow-stimulating technique used in the hip to treat cartilage defects associated with femoro-acetabular impingement, instability, or traumatic hip injury. These defects have a low probability of healing spontaneously and therefore often require surgical intervention. Originally adapted from the knee, microfracture is part of a spectrum of cartilage repair options that include palliative procedures such as debridement and lavage, reparative procedures such as marrow-stimulating techniques (abrasion arthroplasty and microfracture), and restorative procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral allograft/autografts. The basic indications for microfracture of the hip include focal and contained lesions typically less than 4 cm in diameter, full-thickness (Outerbridge grade IV) defects in weightbearing areas, unstable lesions with intact subchondral bone, and focal lesions without evidence of surrounding chondromalacia. Although not extensively studied in the hip, there are some small clinical series with promising early outcomes. Although the widespread use of microfracture in the hip is hindered by difficulties in identifying lesions on preoperative imaging and instrumentation to circumvent the femoral head, this technique continues to gain acceptance as an initial treatment for small, focal cartilage defects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.022,3D printed biofunctionalized scaffolds for microfracture repair of cartilage defects,"While articular cartilage defects affect millions of people worldwide from adolescents to adults, the repair of articular cartilage defects still remains challenging due to the limited endogenous regeneration of the tissue and poor integration with implants. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed scaffold functionalized with aggrecan that supports the cellular fraction of bone marrow released from microfracture, a widely used clinical procedure, and demonstrated tremendous improvement of regenerated cartilage tissue quality and joint function in a lapine model. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed doubled thickness of the regenerated cartilage tissue in the group treated with our aggrecan functionalized scaffold compared to standard microfracture treatment. H&E staining showed 366 ± 95 chondrocytes present in the unit area of cartilage layer with the support of bioactive scaffold, while conventional microfracture group showed only 112 ± 26 chondrocytes. The expression of type II collagen appeared almost 10 times higher with our approach compared to normal microfracture, indicating the potential to overcome the fibro-cartilage formation associated with the current microfracture approach. The therapeutic effect was also evaluated at joint function level. The mobility was evaluated using a modified Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale. While the defect control group showed no movement improvement over the course of study, all experimental groups showed a trend of increasing scores over time. The present work developed an effective method to regenerate critical articular defects by combining a 3D-printed therapeutic scaffold with the microfracture surgical procedure. This biofunctionalized acellular scaffold has great potential to be applied as a supplement for traditional microfracture to improve the quality of cartilage regeneration in a cost and labor effective way.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1071100714563308,Anterolateral Tibial Osteotomy for Accessing Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus in Autologous Osteochondral Transplantation,"Background: Autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) is a primary treatment strategy for large or cystic osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT) or a secondary replacement strategy after failed bone marrow stimulation. The technique requires perpendicular access to the talar dome, which is often difficult to obtain for posterior or lateral lesions. Traditional methods to access these areas have required disruption of the syndesmotic complex with concern over osteotomy reduction, malalignment, and ligament disruption. An alternate to these traditional methods of access is an anterolateral tibial osteotomy. The purpose of this study was to report functional and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes in a series of patients that underwent AOT for treatment of an OLT via an anterolateral tibial osteotomy. Methods: Records of patients that underwent an anterolateral tibial osteotomy for AOT were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and postoperative Foot and Ankle Outcome Scores (FAOS) and demographic data were recorded. Magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) was used to assess morphologic state of tibial cartilage at the repair site of the osteotomy. Quantitative T2 mapping MRI was analyzed in the superficial and deep cartilage layers of the repair site of the osteotomy and in adjacent normal cartilage to serve as control tissue. Seventeen patients with a mean age of 36.9 (range, 17-76) years underwent anterolateral tibial osteotomy with a mean follow-up of 64 (range, 29 to 108) months. MOCART data were available in 9 of 17 patients, and quantitative T2 mapping was available in 6 patients. Results: FAOS significantly improved from an average 39.2 (range, 14 to 66) out of 100 points preoperatively to 81.2 (range, 19 to 98) postoperatively ( P &lt; .01). The average MOCART score was 73.9 out of 100 points (range, 40 to 100). Quantitative T2 analysis demonstrated relaxation times that were not significantly different from the normal native cartilage in both the deep half and superficial half of interface repair tissue ( P &gt; .05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the anterolateral tibial osteotomy was a reasonable alternative for accessing centrolateral or posterolateral OLT for AOT with limited morbidity associated with the osteotomy. The evidence demonstrated adequate osteotomy and cartilaginous healing with improvement in functional outcome scores at medium-term follow-up. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case series.",0

Unsalvageable OCD lesions have been treated with various techniques, including fragment excision, microfracture, osteochondral autograft transfer, fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Hypothesis: Patients who underwent ACI as treatment for unsalvageable OCD more than 10 years ago would maintain satisfactory patient-oriented outcome measures and have a low need for additional open surgery, especially arthroplasty. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: All Swedish and Norwegian patients (59 patients with 67 OCD lesions) who underwent ACI for OCD under the direction of the senior author between 1990 and 2005 were identified through manual chart review. Features of the patient, OCD lesion, and surgery were extracted from the medical record and intraoperative photographs. Patients were sent questionnaires to assess the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner-Wallgren activity score, and Lysholm score. In addition, patients were asked whether they had to undergo further surgery, including knee replacement, of the knee that underwent ACI. They were asked whether they would have the surgery again if in the same situation. Results: A total of 55 patients (93%) with 61 OCD lesions (91%) responded. The median follow-up duration was 19 years (range, 10-26 years) and the median age at follow-up was 43 years (range, 28-69 years). Subsequent arthroscopy was performed in the majority of cases, although many of these were scheduled “second looks” as part of a study. With respect to other subsequent surgery, 12 knees (20%) underwent any additional open surgery, but only 2 knees (3%) underwent arthroplasty. Eight knees (13%) underwent revision ACI. Most patients reached their preinjury activity level (62%) and would undergo ACI again if in the same situation (85%). If failure is defined as revision of the graft or conversion to arthroplasty, then survivorship after ACI for OCD in the current study would be 87% at 10 years, 85% at 15 years, and 82% at 20 years. Conclusion: ACI for OCD provides a durable treatment option. At a median follow-up of 19 years, there was a very low (~3%) conversion to total knee arthroplasty.",0

Evidence for the variety of surgical treatments available is inconclusive. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with symptomatic cartilage defects treated with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI or microfracture (MF). Included patients were >or= 18 and <or= 50 years of age with symptomatic, post-traumatic, single, isolated chondral defects (4-10 cm2) and were randomised to receive MACI or MF. Patients were followed up 8-12, 22-26 and 50-54 weeks post-operatively for efficacy and safety evaluation. Outcome measures were the Tegner, Lysholm and ICRS scores. Sixty patients were included in a randomised study (40 MACI, 20 MF). The difference between baseline and 24 months post-operatively for both treatment groups was significant for the Lysholm, Tegner, patient ICRS and surgeon ICRS scores (all P < 0.0001). However, MACI was significantly more effective over time (24 months versus baseline) than MF according to the Lysholm (P = 0.005), Tegner (P = 0.04), ICRS patient (P = 0.03) and ICRS surgeon (P = 0.02) scores. There were no safety issues related to MACI or MF during the study. MACI is superior to MF in the treatment of articular defects over 2 years. MACI and MF are complementary procedures, depending on the size of the defect and symptom recurrence. The MACI technique represents a significant advance over both first and second generation chondrocyte-based cartilage repair techniques for surgeons, patients, health care institutions and payers in terms of reproducibility, safety, intraoperative time, surgical simplicity and reduced invasiveness.",1

This technique allows advantages of both the Pridie technique and the in situ proliferation of mesenchymal cells beneath a biological collagen membrane, 'augmented', with bone marrow blood. The collagen membrane forms the roof of a 'biological chamber', and serves to protect and contains the stem cells as they differentiate into chondrocytes, which will form a healthy regenerative cartilage.",0

Previous studies have demonstrated a negative effect of blood on native cartilage; however, the effect of the contact of blood on engineered cartilage is unclear. Methods Articular chondrocytes were isolated from swine joints, expanded in monolayer culture, and seeded onto collagen membranes. The seeded membranes were cultured for 3 days in the presence of different concentrations of peripheral blood. Some samples were retrieved at the end of the blood contact, others after 21 additional days of standard culture conditions, in order to investigate the “long-term effect” of the blood contact. Results All seeded samples showed an increase in the weight and an evident cartilage-like matrix production. A concentration-dependent reduction in the mitochondrial activity due to blood contact was shown at the earlier culture time, followed by a partial recover at the longer culture time. Conclusion A blood contact of 3 days affected the chondrocytes' activity and determined a delay in the maturation of the engineered cartilage. These findings have clinical relevance, as autologous chondrocytes seeded onto biological scaffolds has become an established surgical method for articular cartilage repair. Therefore, further investigation into material sciences should be encouraged for the development of scaffold protecting the reparative cells from the blood insult.",0

First-generation ACI used a periosteal patch, leading to the second generation, in which a type I–type III collagen membrane is used to cover the autologous chondrocytes, and ultimately the third generation, in which autologous chondrocytes are seeded onto the scaffold itself. As third-generation, scaffold-based ACI techniques are becoming more widely available, interest in the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes continues to grow, especially given the high costs associated with these procedures. Several studies have now shown persistently improved clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up, which support the increasing utilization of third-generation ACI techniques. However, it is important to continue to develop our understanding of the limitations of and expectations with third-generation ACI, particularly regarding reoperation, as well as to continue to design high-quality long-term studies that can evaluate differences in technology.",0

There are also an increasing number of patients with autologous chondrocyte implantation as a second-line therapy that is used after failed bone marrow stimulation in the patient's history. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of previous bone marrow stimulation on subsequent autologous chondrocyte implantation therapy. In this study, the clinical results after the matrix-based autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee in a follow-up over 3 years postoperatively were analysed. METHODS: Forty patients were included in this study. A total of 20 patients with cartilage defects of the knee were treated with third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (Novocart® 3D) as first-line therapy. The mean defect size was 5.4 cm(2) (SD 2.6). IKDC subjective score and VAS were used for clinical evaluation after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. The results of these patients were compared with 20 matched patients with autologous chondrocyte implantation as second-line therapy. Matched pair analysis was performed by numbers of treated defects, defect location, defect size, gender, age and BMI. RESULTS: Both the first-line (Group I) and second-line group (Group II) showed significantly better clinical results in IKDC score and VAS score in the follow-up over 3 years compared with the preoperative findings. In addition, Group I showed significantly better results in the IKDC and VAS during the whole postoperative follow-up after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months compared to Group II with second-line autologous chondrocyte implantation (IKDC 6 months p = 0.015, 1 year p = 0.001, 2 years p = 0.001, 3 years p = 0.011). Additionally, we found a lower failure rate in Group I. No revision surgery was performed in Group I. The failure rate in the second-line Group II was 30%. CONCLUSION: This study showed that third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation is a suitable method for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects. Both, Group I and Group II showed significant improvement in our follow-up. However, in comparing the results of the two groups, autologous chondrocyte implantation after failed bone marrow stimulation leads to worse clinical results. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25940,Enhancement of tendon-to-bone healing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells genetically modified with bFGF/BMP2,"Abstract Many strategies, including various growth factors and gene transfer, have been used to augment healing after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The biological environment regulated by the growth factors during the stage of tendon-bone healing was considered important in controlling the integrating process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) genetically modified with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on healing after ACL reconstruction. BMSCs were infected with an adenoviral vector encoding BMP2 (AdBMP2) or bFGF (AdbFGF). Then, the infected BMSCs were surgically implanted into the tendon-bone interface. At 12 weeks postoperatively, the formation of abundant cartilage-like cells, smaller tibial bone tunnel and significantly higher ultimate load and stiffness levels, through histological analysis, micro-computed tomography and biomechanical testing, were observed. In addition, the AdBMP2-plus-AdbFGF group had the smallest bone tunnel and the best mechanical properties among all the groups. The addition of BMP2 or bFGF by gene transfer resulted in better cellularity, new bone formation and higher mechanical property, which contributed to the healing process after ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, the co-application of these two genes was more powerful and efficient than either single gene therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546514535068,Double-Plug Autologous Osteochondral Transplantation Shows Equal Functional Outcomes Compared With Single-Plug Procedures in Lesions of the Talar Dome,"Background: Autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) is used for large (&gt;100-150 mm 2 ) or cystic osteochondral lesions (OCLs) of the talus. Larger lesions may require using more than 1 graft to fill the defect. While patients with larger OCLs treated with microfracture exhibit inferior clinical outcomes, there is little evidence regarding the effect of lesion size and number of grafts required on clinical and radiological outcomes after AOT. Hypothesis: Larger OCLs of the talar dome treated by double-plug AOT (dp-AOT) have inferior clinical and radiological MRI outcomes compared with smaller OCLs requiring single-plug AOT (sp-AOT). Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Fourteen consecutive patients with a large OCL (mean, 208 ± 54 mm 2 ) treated using dp-AOT with a minimum 5-year follow-up were matched by age and sex to a control cohort of 28 patients who underwent sp-AOT for a smaller OCL (mean, 74 ± 26 mm 2 ) over the same period. Functional outcomes were assessed both pre- and postoperatively using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Short Form–12 (SF-12) general health questionnaire. Mean follow-up was 85 months (range, 65-118 months). Latest postoperative MRI was evaluated with modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. Results: There was no significant difference between groups demographically ( P &gt; .05). All patients with dp-AOT and sp-AOT showed a significant pre- to postoperative increase in FAOS and SF-12 scores ( P &lt; .001). When comparing preoperative scores for both groups, there was no statistical significance between sp-AOT and dp-AOT scores (FAOS, P = .719; SF-12, P = .947). There was no significant difference in functional scores between the 2 groups postoperatively for both FAOS ( P = .883) and SF-12 ( P = .246). Mean MOCART scores did not exhibit any statistically significant difference between groups ( P = .475). Two patients complained of knee donor site stiffness (4.8%), which later resolved. Conclusion: Patients with large OCLs treated using a dp-AOT procedure did not show inferior clinical or radiological outcomes compared with those treated with sp-AOT at a minimum 5-year follow-up. The dp-AOT procedure is as effective as sp-AOT in treating larger OCLs of the talar dome in the intermediate term, with similar high postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes.",0

It commonly occurs in the knee joint, elbow, wrist, and ankle. Although several surgical concepts have been described to treat OCD (fragment fixation, microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and mosaicplasty), no gold standard treatment has been accepted for managing OCD. Multiple factors like age, stability of defect, and defect size should be considered while selecting a specific treatment for OCD. Here, we discuss the case of an 18-year-old patient with horizontal and noncontained OCD. The MRI and CT scan evaluations of condylar notch view showed a defect (23 mm × 19 mm × 8 mm) with ICRS grade IV lateral femoral condyle OCD that was successfully managed by gel-based ACI. After 9 years of ACI, the patient was asymptomatic with full range of motions at the knees. Improvement in visual analog scale score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score was also seen at 9 years post-ACI. No further surgical interventions were needed post-ACI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.b.33120,In vivotelemetric determination of shear and axial loads on a regenerative cartilage scaffold following ligament disruption,"Recent interest in repair of chondral and osteochondral cartilage defects to prevent osteoarthritis caused by ligament disruption has led to the research and development of biomimetic scaffolds combined with cell-based regeneration techniques. Current clinical focal defect repair strategies have had limited success. New scaffold-based approaches may provide solutions that can repair extensive damage and prevent osteoarthritis. This study utilized a novel scaffold design that accommodated strain gauges for shear and axial load monitoring in the canine stifle joint through implantable telemetry technology. Loading changes induced by ligament disruption are widely implicated in the development of injury-related osteoarthritis. Seeding the scaffold end with progenitor cells resulted in higher shear stress than without cell seeding and histology showed significantly more bone and cartilage formation. Biomechanically, the effect of transecting the anterior cruciate ligament was a significant reduction in braking load in shear, but no change axially, and conversely a significant reduction in push-off load axially, but no change in shear. This is the first study to report shear loads measured directly in knee joint tissue. Further, advances of these measurement techniques are critical to developing improved regeneration strategies and personalizing reliable rehabilitation protocols.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546511399382,Outcomes After a Single-Stage Procedure for Cell-Based Cartilage Repair,"Background: There are currently several approaches being pursued to treat focal defects of articular cartilage, each having specific advantages or challenges. A single-stage procedure that uses autologous cartilage fragments, Cartilage Autograft Implantation System (CAIS), is being evaluated in patients and may offer a clinically effective option. Purpose: To establish the safety of CAIS and to test whether CAIS improves quality of life by using standardized outcomes assessment tools. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Patients (n = 29) were randomized (1:2) with the intent to treat with either a control (microfracture [MFX]) or an experimental (CAIS) procedure. Patients were followed at predetermined time points for 2 years using several standardized outcomes assessment tools (SF-36, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6, 12, and 24 months. Results: Lesion size and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade were similar in both groups. General outcome measures (eg, physical component score of the SF-36) indicated an overall improvement in both groups, and no differences in the number of adverse effects were noted in comparisons between the CAIS and MFX groups. The IKDC score of the CAIS group was significantly higher (73.9 ± 14.72 at 12 months and 82.95 ± 14.88 at 24 months) compared with the MFX group (57.78 ± 18.31 at 12 months and 59.5 ± 13.44 at 24 months). Select subdomains (4/5) in the KOOS instrument were significantly different at 12 and 18 months, and all subdomains (Symptoms and Stiffness, Pain, Activities of Daily Living, Sports and Recreation, Knee-related Quality of Life) were significantly increased at 24 months in CAIS with scores of 88.47 ± 11.68, 90.64 ± 7.87, 97.29 ± 3.8, 78.16 ± 22.06, and 69 ± 23.15 compared with 75 ± 9.31, 78.94 ± 13.73, 89.46 ± 8.13, 51.67 ± 26.01, and 37.15 ± 21.67 in the MFX group. These significant improvements were maintained at 24 months in both IKDC and KOOS. Qualitative analysis of the imaging data did not note differences between the 2 groups in fill of the graft bed, tissue integration, or presence of subchondral cysts. Patients treated with MFX had a significantly higher incidence of intralesional osteophyte formation (54% and 70% of total number of lesions treated) at 6 and 12 months when compared with CAIS (8% and 25% of total number of lesions treated). Conclusion: The first clinical experience in using CAIS for treating patients with focal chondral defects indicates that it is a safe, feasible, and effective method that may improve long-term clinical outcomes.",1

Twelve weeks after injection, the animals were sacrificed and the femoral condyles were evaluated macroscopically and histologically by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Then, histological sections were scored using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual histological scale.Findings showed that in both mfx/ACP-treated groups, the defects were filled regularly and smoothly, the defects had a greater fill and good integration into the surrounding host tissue, and the repair matrix had more hyaline-like character. On the other hand, defects were filled with an irregular, fibrous cartilage in the mfx-treated group. Histological scores in Group 2 and Group 3 were better compared to Group 1.In the present study, we were able to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intraarticular administration of ACP as a coadjuvant of microfractures in order to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage in full-thickness chondral lesions in a rabbit model.",0

Between 2004 and 2007, thirty patients were treated for symptomatic focal chondral lesions of the medial femoral condyle. All patients were monitored during surgery for gas embolism signs and symptoms and were evaluated preoperatively and at a median follow-up of 70.5 months (range 48-93 months) using the KOOS subjective evaluation score, the Lysholm function score, the Tegner activity scale for the knee, and the IKDC objective score. No cases of intraoperative or postoperative symptoms or signs related to gas embolism or persistent subcutaneous emphysema were registered. Each subscale of the KOOS subjective score improved from preoperative to follow-up. The median Lysholm score was 50 (range 15-66) at baseline and 87.5 (range 54-100) at follow-up (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). The median Tegner score was 2 (range 1-4) at baseline to 5 (range 2-7) at follow-up (p \textbackslashtextless 0.05). No complications registered, and the satisfactory clinical results achieved in this series suggest that carbon dioxide insufflation during arthroscopic MACI is a safe and accessible option to improve visualization during the dry phase of the scaffold implant on medial femoral condyles.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546514548022,Degree of Preoperative Subchondral Bone Edema Is Not Associated With Pain and Graft Outcomes After Matrix-Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) is an established technique for the repair of knee chondral defects. While a number of factors may affect the clinical outcome, little is known about the influence of subchondral bone abnormalities at the time of surgery on pain and graft outcomes after MACI. Purpose: To investigate the association between subchondral bone marrow edema within 3 months before MACI surgery on preoperative and postoperative reported pain and symptoms as well as postoperative graft outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This retrospective study was undertaken in 56 patients undergoing MACI with clinical and radiological assessments before surgery and at 3, 12, 24, and 60 months after surgery. Patients were assessed using the Pain and Symptoms subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the severity of preoperative subchondral bone marrow edema, while graft infill and an MRI composite graft score were evaluated after surgery via the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) scoring system. Linear regression utilizing generalized estimating equations was used to investigate the association between preoperative subchondral bone marrow edema scores and preoperative and postoperative KOOS subscores as well as postoperative MRI-based scores of graft repair. Results: The degree of preoperative subchondral bone marrow edema was not significantly associated with postoperative outcomes, whereby there was no evidence of a difference between edema subgroups over all time points for the KOOS-Pain subscore ( P = .644), KOOS-Symptoms subscore ( P = .475), or MRI composite score ( P = .685) after adjustment for potential confounders of age, body mass index, defect size, and defect location. Conclusion: No association was demonstrated between the severity of preoperative subchondral bone marrow edema with postoperative patient-reported knee pain or symptoms or postoperative graft repair assessed via MRI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2011.08.283,Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Strategies in Meniscus Lesions,"The aim of this systematic review was to address tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) strategies applied to the meniscus, specifically (1) clinical applications, indications, results, and pitfalls and (2) the main trends in research assessed by evaluation of preclinical (in vivo) studies.Three independent reviewers performed a search on PubMed, from 2006 to March 31, 2011, using the term ""meniscus"" with all of the following terms: ""scaffolds,"" ""constructs,"" ""cells,"" ""growth factors,"" ""implant,"" ""tissue engineering,"" and ""regenerative medicine."" Inclusion criteria were English language-written, original clinical research (Level of Evidence I to IV) and preclinical studies of TERM application in knee meniscal lesions. Reference lists and related articles on journal Web sites of selected articles were checked until prepublication for potential studies that could not be identified eventually by our original search. The modified Coleman Methodology score was used for study quality analysis of clinical trials.The PubMed search identified 286 articles (a similar search from 2000 to 2005 identified 161 articles). Non-English-language articles (n = 9), Level V publications (n = 19), in vitro studies (n = 118), and 102 studies not related to the topic were excluded. One reference was identified outside of PubMed. Thirty-eight references that met the inclusion criteria were identified from the original search. On the basis of our prepublication search, 2 other references were included. A total of 9 clinical and 31 preclinical studies were selected for further analysis. Of the clinical trials, 1 was classified as Level I, 2 as Level II, and 6 as Level IV. Eight referred to acellular scaffold implantation for partial meniscal replacement, and one comprised fibrin clot application. The mean modified Coleman Methodology score was 48.0 (SD, 15.7). Of the preclinical studies, 11 original works reported on studies using large animal models whereas 20 research studies used small animals. In these studies the experimental design favored cell-seeded scaffolds or scaffolds enhanced with growth factors (GFs) in attempts to improve tissue healing, as opposed to the plain acellular scaffolds that were predominant in clinical trials. Injection of mesenchymal stem cells and gene therapy are also presented as alternative strategies.Partial meniscal substitution using acellular scaffolds in selected patients with irreparable loss of tissue may be a safe and promising procedure. However, there is only 1 randomized controlled study supporting its application, and globally, many methodologic issues of published trials limit further conclusions. We registered a different trend in preclinical trials, with most considering augmentation of scaffolds by cells and/or GFs, as opposed to the predominantly acellular approach in clinical trials. Different TERM approaches to enhance meniscal repair or regeneration are in preclinical analysis, such as the use of mesenchymal stem cells, gene therapy, and GFs alone or in combination, and thus could be considered in the design of subsequent trials.Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.",0

Biomarkers that were identified in this proteomic analysis or that relate to osteoarthritis (OA) severity or have predictive value in another early OA therapy (autologous cell implantation) were measured in the SF of 19 and 13 patients before microfracture or osteotomy, respectively, using commercial immunoassays, and were normalized to urea. These were aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), hyaluronan (HA), lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1), matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 3, soluble CD14, S100 calcium binding protein A13, and 14-3-3 protein theta (YWHAQ). Levels of COMP and HA were also measured in the plasma of these patients. To find predictors of postoperative function, multivariable regression analyses were performed.Proteomic analyses highlighted YWHAQ and LYVE-1 as being differentially abundant between the clinical responders/improvers and nonresponders after microfracture. A linear regression model after backward variable selection could relate preoperative concentrations of SF proteins (HA, YWHAQ, LYVE-1), activity of ADAMTS-4, and patient demographic characteristics (smoker status and sex) with Lysholm score 12 months after microfracture. Further, a generalized linear model with elastic net penalization indicated that lower preoperative activity of ADAMTS-4 in SF, being a nonsmoker, and being younger at the time of operation were indicative of a higher postoperative Lysholm score (improved joint function) after osteotomy surgery.We have identified biomarkers and generated regression models with the potential to predict clinical outcome in patients treated with microfracture or osteotomy of the knee.Candidate protein biomarkers identified in this study have the potential to help determine which patients will be best suited to treatment with microfracture or osteotomy.",0

There were 16 males and 6 females with an average age of 22-60 years (mean, 38.6 years). The cause of injury was traffic accident in 8 cases and sports injuries in 14 cases. The disease duration was 1-6 months (mean, 3.4 months). There were 15 cases of medial femoral condyle injuries and 7 cases of lateral condyle injuries. The area of cartilage defect was 4-6 cm 2 (mean, 4.98 cm 2). According to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) classification, 9 cases were rated as grade Ⅲ and 13 cases as grade Ⅳ. Eighteen cases were combined with meniscus injuries. Preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 6.36±1.25 and Lysholm score was 36.00±7.77.All incisions healed by first intention.

Design and methods: Forty-nine examinations were performed in 49 patients at 1 year after ACI in the knee. Forty-one preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were also available. The grafts were assessed for smoothness, thickness in comparison with that of adjacent cartilage, signal intensity, integration to underlying bone and adjacent cartilage, and congruity of subchondral bone. Presence of overgrowth and bone marrow appearance beneath the graft were also assessed. Presence of osteophyte formation, further cartilage defects, appearance of the cruciate ligaments and the menisci were also recorded. An overall graft score was constructed, using the graft appearances. This was correlated with the knee features and the Lysholm score, a clinical self-assessment score. The data were analysed by a Kruskal-Wallis H test followed by a Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction as post-hoc test. Results: Of 49 grafts, 32 (65%) demonstrated complete defect filling 1 year postoperatively. General overgrowth was seen in eight grafts (16%), and partial overgrowth in 13 grafts (26%). Bone marrow change underneath the graft was seen; oedema was seen in 23 grafts (47%), cysts in six grafts (12%) and sclerosis in two grafts (4%). Mean graft score was 8.7 (of maximal 12) (95% CI 8.0-9.5). Knees without osteophyte formation or additional other cartilage defects (other than the graft site) had a significantly higher graft score than knees with multiple osteophytes (P=0.0057) or multiple further cartilage defects (P=0.014). At 1 year follow-up improvement in the clinical scores was not significantly different for any subgroup. Knees with a graft score of 8 points or greater had a better improvement of the clinical score than those of 7 points or fewer. Conclusions: At 1 year follow-up after ACI, higher graft scores are associated with an overall better preserved knee joint. ACI improves the clinical outcome, but there is no statistically significant correlation of graft score and clinical outcome.",0

These patients were part of a larger pilot study in which 18 patients underwent the same procedure. PBSCs were harvested and cryopreserved preoperatively. At 1 week after surgery, 8 mL of PBSCs was mixed with 2 mL of hyaluronic acid and injected intra-articularly into the knee joint; this was repeated once a week for 5 consecutive weeks. Three additional intra-articular injections were administered weekly at intervals of 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Informed consent was obtained at the time of hardware removal for opportunistic second-look arthroscopy and chondral biopsy. Biopsy specimens were stained with H&E, safranin O, and immunohistochemical staining for type I and II collagen. Specimens were graded using the 14 components of the ICRS Visual Assessment Scale II, and a total score was obtained.Second-look arthroscopy showed satisfactory healing of the regenerated cartilage. Histologic analysis showed significant amounts of proteoglycan and type II collagen. The total ICRS Visual Assessment Scale II histologic scores comparing the regenerated articular cartilage (mean, 1,274) with normal articular cartilage (mean, 1,340) indicated that the repair cartilage score approached 95% of the normal articular cartilage score.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546512441585,Synthetic Resorbable Scaffolds for the Treatment of Isolated Patellofemoral Cartilage Defects in Young Patients,"Background: Surgical management of patellar cartilage defects remains controversial. The ideal technique to regenerate hyaline cartilage is not yet defined. However, a synthetic resorbable osteochondral scaffold plug (TruFit CB) seems to offer a treatment option with good results at short-term follow-up, at least in the condylar setting. Hypothesis: A synthetic implant provides a simple and efficacious means of treating the cartilage defects of the patellofemoral joint in young patients. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A study was designed to evaluate prospectively short- and medium-term results in patients with osteochondral patellar defects treated with synthetic reabsorbable scaffolds. Patient outcome scores (Short Form 36 [SF-36] and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]), demographics, prior surgeries, and data from a physical examination were collected at baseline (before implantation) and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Defect characteristics were collected during implantation. Diagnosis and monitoring were performed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Ten patients with a mean age of 33.3 years (range, 16-49 years) were evaluated prospectively at 24 months’ follow-up. The number of plugs used for each patient ranged from 1 to 4. At 1-year follow-up, the results were satisfactory in 8 of 10 patients, and poor in 2, according to clinical assessment (KOOS, visual analog scale, and SF-36). At 18 months of follow-up, all patients except one complained of pain and knee swelling. Reoperation rate for implant failure at final follow-up was 70%. Magnetic resonance imaging at final follow-up showed a cylindrical cavity of fibrous tissue instead of subchondral bone restoration. Conclusion: A synthetic implant can improve symptoms and joint function, especially for small lesions, only for a short period of time. However, 2 years of monitoring has shown its failure in restoring the subchondral bone despite the formation of predominant hyaline cartilage from synthetic resorbable scaffolds. Under current conditions and according to our experience, we do not recommend TruFit synthetic implants for osteochondral patellar defects in active patients.",0

MR examination was made before surgery and 6, 12, and 18 months thereafter. Qualitative changes in cartilage were observed by means of delayed gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage sequence using Gd-DTPA2− and Gd-DOTA. In each examination, GAGs content was determined at three locations: the defect, its surroundings, and a non-load-bearing reference area. <h3>Results</h3> Measured indices showed no statistically significant differences in changes within the defect area when comparing the two treatment types at individual time points of 6, 12, and 18 months. In the case of microfracture treatment, more substantial decrease in GAGs concentration occurred at month 6, whereas the greatest decline occurred at month 12 when using an implant. Change in GAGs content and decline in cartilage quality were substantial also in the reference area and close surroundings. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Hyaline cartilage behaves as a unified whole, and change in GAGs content was marked also in locations with no morphological damage. Over the monitored period, no statistically significant difference between treatment types was noted as measured by GAGs content in the defect or its close surroundings. dGEMRIC is suitable for monitoring cartilage quality even if use of Gd-DTPA2− is not possible, because comparable results were achieved using Gd-DOTA.",1

Purpose: We aimed to establish whether MACI or ACI-P provides superior long-term outcomes in terms of patient satisfaction, clinical assessment, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 21 patients with cartilage defects at the femoral condyle were randomized to MACI (n = 11) or ACI-P (n = 10) between the years 2004 and 2006. Patients were assessed for subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm and Gillquist score, Tegner Activity Score, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) preoperatively (T0), at 1 and 2 years postoperatively (T1, T2), and at the final follow-up 8 to 11 years after surgery (T3). Onset of osteoarthritis was determined using the Kellgren-Lawrence score and Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score, and delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage was used to evaluate the cartilage. Adverse events were recorded to assess safety. Results: There were 16 patients (MACI, n = 9; ACI-P, n = 7) who were reassessed on average 9.6 years after surgery (76% follow-up rate). The Lysholm and Gillquist score improved in both groups after surgery and remained elevated but reached statistical significance only in ACI-P at T1 and T2. IKDC scores increased significantly at all postoperative evaluation time points in ACI-P. In MACI, IKDC scores showed a significant increase at T1 and T3 when compared with T0. In the majority of the patients (10/16; MACI, 5/9; ACI-P, 5/7) a complete defect filling was present at the final follow-up as shown by the MOCART score, and 1 patient in the ACI-P group displayed hypertrophy of the repair tissue, which represents 6% of the whole study group and 14.3% of the ACI-P group. Besides higher SF-36 vitality scores in ACI-P at T3, no significant differences were seen in clinical scores and MRI scores between the 2 methods at any time point. Revision rate was 33.3% in MACI and 28.6% in ACI-P at the last follow-up. Conclusion: Our long-term results suggest that first- and third-generation ACI methods are equally effective treatments for isolated full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee. With the number of participants available, no significant difference was noted between MACI and ACI-P at any time point. Interpretation of our data has to be performed with caution due to the small sample size, which was further limited by a loss to follow-up of 24%.",1

Biphasic scaffolds have been developed to address defects of the entire osteochondral unit by reproducing the different biological and functional requirements and guiding the growth of both bone and cartilage. Purpose: To evaluate midterm clinical and imaging results after cell-free osteochondral scaffold implantation for the treatment of knee OCD. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Twenty-seven patients (8 women, 19 men; mean age, 25.5 ± 7.7 years) were treated for knee OCD, with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade 3 to 4 lesions with a mean size of 3.4 ± 2.2 cm 2 (range, 1.5-12 cm 2 ), and prospectively evaluated for up to 5 years using the ICRS classification system and the Tegner score. Eighteen patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24 and 60 months of follow-up, and the graft was evaluated using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score for the cartilage layer, while a specific score was used for subchondral bone. Results: All patients significantly improved their clinical scores at each follow-up until their final evaluation. The mean International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score improved from 48.4 ± 17.8 to 82.2 ± 12.2 at 2 years ( P &lt; .0005), and it then remained stable for up to 5 years postoperatively (90.1 ± 12.0). The mean Tegner score increased from 2.4 ± 1.7 preoperatively to 4.4 ± 1.6 at 2 years ( P = .001), with a further increase up to 5.0 ± 1.7 at 5 years of follow-up ( P &lt; .0005 vs preoperatively), reaching almost the preinjury level (5.7 ± 2.2). The MOCART score showed stable results between 24 and 60 months, whereas the subchondral bone status significantly improved over time. No correlation was found between MRI findings and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: This 1-step cell-free scaffold implantation procedure showed good and stable results for up to 60 months of follow-up for the treatment of knee OCD. MRI showed abnormalities, in particular at the subchondral bone level, but there was an overall improvement of features over time. No correlation was found between imaging and clinical findings.",0

The first procedures consisted of ACL reconstruction and collagen meniscus implant (CMI), followed 6 months later by autologous chondrocyte implantation on a collagen membrane (MACI). A CMI biopsy was performed 6 months after implantation. Histologic and ultrastructural analysis documented scaffold invasion by cells and newly synthesized connective tissue. At 2-year follow up, the clinical and functional results were good and magnetic resonance imaging showed integration of the meniscal and cartilage implants. In this patient, each lesion needed to be addressed to achieve an optimal outcome. The primary goal was to restore normal joint biomechanics by performing CMI and ACL reconstruction. MACI was an adequate solution for the management of the large (5 cm<sup>2</sup>) chondral defect.",0

Our study investigates the possibility of direct intra-articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells suspended in hyaluronic acid (HA) as an alternative to the much more invasive methods currently available. A partial-thickness (without penetration of the subchondral bone) cartilage defect was created in the medial femoral condyle of an adult minipig. Mesenchymal stem cells from the iliac crest marrow of the same pig harvested in a separate procedure and suspended in 2 milliliters of hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc) were injected intra-articularly after the creation of the defect. This was followed by two more injections of hylan G-F 20 (HA) at weekly intervals. Either saline or HA was injected into the knees of the controls. The pigs were sacrificed at 6 and 12 weeks for morphological and histological analysis. The cell-treated groups showed improved cartilage healing both histologically and morphologically at 6 and 12 weeks compared with both controls. The use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal stem cells suspended in HA is a viable option for treating large cartilage defects. This would be further explored in clinical trials. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.,0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-006-0146-9,Magnetization transfer analysis of cartilage repair tissue: a preliminary study,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) after two different cartilage repair procedures, and to compare these data with the MTR of normal cartilage. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Twenty-seven patients with a proven cartilage defect were recruited: 13 were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and 14 were treated with the microfracture technique (MFR). All patients underwent MRI examinations with MT-sequences before the surgical treatment, after 12 months (26 patients) and after 24 months (11 patients). Eleven patients received a complete follow-up study at all three time points (five of the ACI group and six of the MFR group). All images were transferred to a workstation to calculate MTR images. For every MT image set, different ROIs were delineated by two radiologists. Means were calculated per ROI type in the different time frames and in both groups of cartilage repair. The data were analyzed with unpaired t- and ANOVA tests, and by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the MTR of fatty bone marrow, muscle and normal cartilage in the different time frames. There was a significant but small difference between the MTR of normal cartilage and the cartilage repair area after 12 months for both procedures. After 24 months, the MTR of ACI repaired cartilage (0.31+/-0.07) was not significantly different from normal cartilage MTR (0.34+/-0.05). The MTR of MFR repaired cartilage (0.28+/-0.02), still showed a significant difference from normal cartilage. CONCLUSION: The differences between damaged and repaired cartilage MTR are too small to enable MT-imaging to be a useful tool for postoperative follow-up of cartilage repair procedures. There is, however, an evolution towards normal MTR-values in the cartilage repair tissue (especially after ACI repair).",0

Hypothesis Hyalograft C scaffold allows arthroscopic ACI, thanks to a specifically designed instrumentation. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Forty-six patients with a mean age of 31.4 years (range, 20–47) underwent operation from 2001 to 2004. They had posttraumatic talar dome lesions, type II or IIA. In the first step of surgery, an ankle arthroscopy was performed, with cartilage harvest from the detached osteochondral fragment or from the margins of the lesion. Chondrocytes were cultured on a Hyalograft C scaffold. In the second step of surgery, the Hyalograft C patch was arthroscopically implanted into the lesion, with a specifically designed instrumentation. Lesions &gt;5 mm deep were first filled with autologous cancellous bone. Patients were evaluated clinically with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score preoperatively and at 12 and 36 months after surgery. At a mean time interval of 18 months, the first 3 patients underwent a second-look arthroscopy with cartilage harvest from the implant and histological examination. Results The mean preoperative AOFAS score was 57.2 ± 14.3. At the 12-month follow-up, the mean AOFAS score was 86.8 ± 13.4 ( P &lt; .0005), while at 36 months after surgery, the mean score was 89.5 ± 13.4 ( P &lt; .0005). Clinical results were significantly related to the age of patients and to previous operations for cartilage repair. The results of the histological examinations revealed hyaline-like cartilage regeneration. Conclusions The Hyalograft C scaffold and the specifically designed instrumentation allowed arthroscopic implantation of chondrocytes, with excellent clinical and histological results.",0

Oxidative stress is considered one of the pathophysiological factors in the progression of OA. We investigated the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), which is an antioxidant, on monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced arthritis of the knee joint of rat, which is an animal model of human OA. GSPE (100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg) or saline was given orally three times per week for 4 weeks after the MIA injection. Pain was measured using the paw withdrawal latency (PWL), the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and the hind limb weight bearing ability. Joint damage was assessed using histological and microscopic analysis and microcomputerized tomography. Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13) and nitrotyrosine were detected using immunohistochemistry. Administration of GSPE to the MIA-treated rats significantly increased the PWL and PWT and this resulted in recovery of hind paw weight distribution (P < 0.05). GSPE reduced the loss of chondrocytes and proteoglycan, the production of MMP13, nitrotyrosine and IL-1β and the formation of osteophytes, and it reduced the number of subchondral bone fractures in the MIA-treated rats. These results indicate that GSPE is antinociceptive and it is protective against joint damage in the MIA-treated rat model of OA. GSPE could open up novel avenues for the treatment of OA.",0

https://doi.org/10.52312/jdrs.2021.19,Effects of adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction on osteochondral defects treated by hyaluronic acid-based scaffold: An experimental study,"Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effect of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) on osteochondral defects treated by hyaluronic acid (HA)-based scaffold in a rabbit model. Materials and methods: Eighteen white New Zealand rabbits were randomly grouped into the experimental group (n=9) and control group (n=9). In all groups, osteochondral defects were induced on the weight-bearing surfaces of the right femoral medial condyles, and a HA-based scaffold was applied to the defect area with microfractures (MFs). In this study, 1 mL of adipose-derived SVF was injected into the knee joints of the rabbits in the experimental group. For histological and macroscopic evaluation, four rabbits were randomly selected from each group at Week 4, and the remaining rabbits were sacrificed at the end of Week 8. Macroscopic assessments of all samples were performed based on the Brittberg scoring system, and microscopic evaluations were performed based on the O’Driscoll scores. Results: Samples were taken at Weeks 4 and 8. At Week 4, the O’Driscoll scores were significantly higher in the control group than the experimental group (p=0.038), while there was no significant difference in the Brittberg scores between the two groups (p=0.108). At Week 8, the O’Driscoll score and Brittberg scores were statistically higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p=0.008 and p=0.007, respectively). According to the microscopic evaluation, at the end of Week 8, the cartilage thickness was greater in the experimental group, and nearly all of the defect area was filled with hyaline cartilage. Conclusion: Application of adipose-derived SVF with MF-HA-based scaffold was better than MF-HA-based scaffold treatment in improving osteochondral regeneration. Therefore, it can be used in combination with microfracture and scaffold to accelerate cartilage regeneration, particularly in the treatment of secondary osteoarthritis.",0

This matrix covers and mechanically stabilizes the clot. There have been an increasing number of studies performed related to the AMIC technique and an update of its use and results is warranted.Using the PubMed database, a literature search was performed using the terms ""AMIC"" or ""Autologous Matrix Induced Chondrogenesis."" A total of 19 basic science and clinical articles were identified.Ten studies that were published on the use of AMIC for knee chondral defects were identified and the results of 219 patients were analyzed. The improvements in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective, Lysholm and Tegner scores at 2 years were comparable to the published results from autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and matrix ACI techniques for cartilage repair.Our systematic review of the current state of the AMIC technique suggests that it is a promising 1-stage cartilage repair technique. The short-term clinical outcomes and magnetic resonance imaging results are comparable to other cell-based methods. Further studies with AMIC in randomized studies versus other repair techniques such as ACI are needed in the future.",0

The treatment of cartilage injuries is not only of great importance in order to reduce the patients' symptoms, but also intends to avoid the appearance of secondary arthrosis. There are several different techniques available for the treatment of full-thickness defects (such as microfracture and autologous chondrocyte implantation), some of them following related principles. The choice of the optimal treatment technique remains of great importance and represents one of the major responsibilities of the surgeon in order to achieve optimal results. The current article represents a review of current techniques and developments in operative cartilage repair of the knee joint and gives help in the decision-making process, since the use of the appropriate technique becomes more and more important in order to achieve optimal clinical results.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14226804,Approximate Optimization Study of Light Curing Waterborne Polyurethane Materials for the Construction of 3D Printed Cytocompatible Cartilage Scaffolds,"Articular cartilage, which is a white transparent tissue with 1-2 mm thickness, is located in the interface between the two hard bones. The main functions of articular cartilage are stress transmission, absorption, and friction reduction. The cartilage cannot be repaired and regenerated once it has been damaged, and it needs to be replaced by artificial joints. Many approaches, such as artificial joint replacement, hyaluronic acid injection, microfracture surgery and cartilage tissue engineering have been applied in clinical treatment. Basically, some of these approaches are foreign material implantation for joint replacement to reach the goal of pain reduction and mechanism support. This study demonstrated another frontier in the research of cartilage reconstruction by applying regeneration medicine additive manufacturing (3D Printing) and stem cell technology. Light curing materials have been modified and tested to be printable and cytocompatible for stem cells in this research. Design of experiments (DOE) is adapted in this investigation to search for the optimal manufacturing parameter for biocompatible scaffold fabrication and stem cell attachment and growth. Based on the results, an optimal working process of biocompatible and printable scaffolds for cartilage regeneration is reported. We expect this study will facilitate the development of cartilage tissue engineering.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.041,Covalent attachment of a three-dimensionally printed thermoplast to a gelatin hydrogel for mechanically enhanced cartilage constructs,"Hydrogels can provide a suitable environment for tissue formation by embedded cells, which makes them suitable for applications in regenerative medicine. However, hydrogels possess only limited mechanical strength, and must therefore be reinforced for applications in load-bearing conditions. In most approaches the reinforcing component and the hydrogel network have poor interactions and the synergetic effect of both materials on the mechanical properties is not effective. Therefore, in the present study, a thermoplastic polymer blend of poly(hydroxymethylglycolide-co-ε-caprolactone)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (pHMGCL/PCL) was functionalized with methacrylate groups (pMHMGCL/PCL) and covalently grafted to gelatin methacrylamide (gelMA) hydrogel through photopolymerization. The grafting resulted in an at least fivefold increase in interface-binding strength between the hydrogel and the thermoplastic polymer material. GelMA constructs were reinforced with three-dimensionally printed pHMGCL/PCL and pMHMGCL/PCL scaffolds and tested in a model for a focal articular cartilage defect. In this model, covalent bonds at the interface of the two materials resulted in constructs with an improved resistance to repeated axial and rotational forces. Moreover, chondrocytes embedded within the constructs were able to form cartilage-specific matrix both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, by grafting the interface of different materials, stronger hybrid cartilage constructs can be engineered.",0
https://doi.org/10.2217/rme.09.86,<i>In vitro</i> study of stem cell communication via gap junctions for fibrocartilage regeneration at entheses,"Entheses are fibrocartilaginous organs that bridge ligament with bone at their interface and add significant insertional strength. To replace a severely damaged ligament, a tissue-engineered graft preinstalled with interfacial fibrocartilage, which is being regenerated from stem cells, appears to be more promising than ligament-alone graft. Such a concept can be realized by a biomimetic approach of establishing a dynamic communication of stem cells with bone cells and/or ligament fibroblasts in vitro.The current study has two objectives. The first objective is to demonstrate functional coculture of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) with mature bone cells/ligament fibroblasts as evidenced by gap-junctional communication in vitro. The second objective is to investigate the role of BMSCs in the regeneration of fibrocartilage within the coculture.Rabbit bone/ligament fibroblasts were dual-stained with DiI-Red and calcein (gap-junction permeable dye), and cocultured with unlabeled BMSCs at fixed ratio (1:10). The functional gap junction was demonstrated by the transfer of calcein from donor to recipient cells that was confirmed and quantified by flow cytometry. Type 2 collagen (cartilage extracellular matrix-specific protein) expressed by the mixed cell lines in the cocultures were estimated by real-time reverse transcription PCR and compared with that of the ligament-bone coculture (control).Significant transfer of calcein into BMSCs was observed and flow cytometry analyses showed a gradual increase in the percentage of BMSCs acquiring calcein with time. Cocultures that included BMSCs expressed significantly more type 2 collagen compared with the control.The current study, for the first time, reported the expression of gap-junctional communication of BMSCs with two adherent cell lines of musculoskeletal system in vitro and also confirmed that incorporation of stem cells augments fibrocartilage regeneration. The results open up a path to envisage a composite graft preinstalled with enthesial fibrocartilage using a stem cell-based coculture system.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-010-1072-x,The subchondral bone in articular cartilage repair: current problems in the surgical management,"As the understanding of interactions between articular cartilage and subchondral bone continues to evolve, increased attention is being directed at treatment options for the entire osteochondral unit, rather than focusing on the articular surface only. It is becoming apparent that without support from an intact subchondral bed, any treatment of the surface chondral lesion is likely to fail. This article reviews issues affecting the entire osteochondral unit, such as subchondral changes after marrow-stimulation techniques and meniscectomy or large osteochondral defects created by prosthetic resurfacing techniques. Also discussed are surgical techniques designed to address these issues, including the use of osteochondral allografts, autologous bone grafting, next generation cell-based implants, as well as strategies after failed subchondral repair and problems specific to the ankle joint. Lastly, since this area remains in constant evolution, the requirements for prospective studies needed to evaluate these emerging technologies will be reviewed.",0

All the studies that dealt with ACI were identified. Only Level I and II studies that compared newer generations against earlier generations were selected, whereas studies that compared ACI against other methods of cartilage repair were excluded. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 7 studies matched the selection criteria. Two studies compared periosteum-based autologous chondrocyte implantation (P-ACI) against collagen membrane–based autologous chondrocyte implantation (C-ACI), whereas one study each compared membrane-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) against P-ACI and C-ACI. One study on C-ACI compared results related to age, whereas 2 studies evaluated postoperative rehabilitation after MACI. There was weak evidence showing that C-ACI is better than P-ACI and that MACI is comparable with both P-ACI and C-ACI. The weak evidence is because of studies with short durations of follow-up, small numbers of patients, medium-sized defects, and younger age groups. There is good evidence favoring an accelerated weight-bearing regimen after MACI. There is currently no evidence that supports scaffold-based ACI or arthroscopic implantation over first-generation ACI. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The hypothesis is thus partly proved in favor of C-ACI/MACI against P-ACI with weak evidence, in favor of accelerated weight bearing after MACI with strong evidence, and not in favor of arthroscopic and scaffold-based implantations because of unavailable evidence. <h3>Level of Evidence</h3> Level II, systematic review of Level I and II studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1947603514526038,Tissue Engineered Meniscus Repair,"Objective. Studies have shown that meniscal repairs have better outcomes over both partial and total meniscectomies. Tissue engineering strategies to repair meniscus tears have been explored using cell sources that involve a donor as well as a period of in vitro cell expansion before use. This study explored cell sources that could be easily harvested and rapidly isolated by enzymatic digestion and cannulated delivery. Methods. Bovine menisci were used to create a bucket handle tear. Cell lines were established from meniscus, synovium, and adipose tissue and fluorescently labeled. At passages P2, P4, and P8, cells were added to the defect from the following experimental groups: cells alone, collagen gel, collagen scaffold, or hyaluronic acid. Menisci constructs were xenografted subcutaneously onto the dorsum of athymic rats and incubated for 3, 6, and 9 weeks, at which time they were retrieved and processed for histology. Results. Meniscal cells were able to repair defects faster and significantly better than adipose or synovium derived cells. Adipose cells were the least effective in comparison. Repair was significantly better at 9 weeks compared with 6 and 3 weeks. Macroscopic examination of menisci that received cell implants showed the thickest tissue in menisci that had collagen implants, and the thinnest fill occurred in menisci treated with cells alone. Histology confirmed no cells or integrative repair in the control specimens. Conclusions. Delivery of cells alone outperformed the additional use of biomaterials. Our results suggest a strategy that would use both meniscus and synovial cells for arthroscopic meniscal repair.",0

The aim of this study was to compare mosaicplasty and matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) at long-term follow-up. Forty-three patients were included: 20 mosaicplasty and 23 MACT. Patients were evaluated before and 12 years after surgery with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores for symptoms and function, and with the Tegner score for activity level. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate repair tissue with the MOCART 2.0 score. Mosaicplasty and MACT showed good clinical and MRI results (IKDC subjective score 75.3 ± 21.8 and 81.8 ± 13.0, both p &lt; 0.0005). Mosaicplasty presented a 10% reoperation rate and a 25% overall failure rate, while no failures were documented in MACT (p = 0.016). While size did not influence the results in the MACT group, mosaicplasty presented lower IKDC objective and Tegner scores in lesions bigger than 2 cm2 (p = 0.031 and p = 0.014, respectively). Mosaicplasty and MACT presented both satisfactory clinical and MRI results at long-term follow-up. However, for larger lesions, MACT presented better subjective and objective outcomes, as well as less failures, which should be considered when choosing the most suitable treatment for patients affected by knee cartilage lesions.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546516656179,One-Stage Cartilage Repair Using a Hyaluronic Acid–Based Scaffold With Activated Bone Marrow–Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Compared With Microfracture,"Background: Articular cartilage injury is frequently encountered, yet treatment options capable of providing durable cartilage repair are limited. Purpose: To investigate the medium-term clinical outcomes of cartilage repair using a 1-stage technique of a hyaluronic acid–based scaffold with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate (HA-BMAC) and compare results with those of microfracture. A secondary aim of this study was to identify specific patient demographic factors and cartilage lesion characteristics that are associated with superior outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Fifty physically active patients (mean age, 45 years) with grade IV cartilage injury of the knee (lesion size, 1.5-24 cm 2 ) were treated with HA-BMAC or microfracture and were observed prospectively for 5 years. Patients were placed into the HA-BMAC group if the health insurance policy of the treating institution supported this option; otherwise, they were placed into the microfracture group. Objective and subjective clinical assessment tools were used preoperatively and at 2 and 5 years postoperatively to compare treatment outcomes. Results: Significant improvements in outcome scores were achieved in both treatment groups at 2 years ( P &lt; .001). In the microfracture group, 64% were classified as normal or nearly normal according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) objective score at 2 years, compared with 100% of those treated with HA-BMAC ( P &lt; .001). Normal or nearly normal objective assessments in the microfracture group declined significantly after 5 years to 28% of patients ( P = .004). All patients treated with HA-BMAC maintained improvement at 5 years according to Lysholm, Tegner, IKDC objective, and IKDC subjective scores. Tegner, IKDC objective, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) assessments demonstrated higher scores in the HA-BMAC treatment group compared with microfracture at 5 years. Lysholm and IKDC subjective scores were similar between treatment groups at 5 years. Poorer outcomes in the microfracture group were demonstrated in cases of lesions larger than 4 cm 2 and nonsolitary lesions. Age greater than 45 years, large size of lesion, and treatment of multiple lesions were not associated with poorer outcome in patients treated with HA-BMAC. Conclusion: Repair of chondral injury using a hyaluronic acid–based scaffold with activated bone marrow aspirate concentrate provides better clinical outcomes and more durable cartilage repair at medium-term follow-up compared with microfracture. Positive short-term clinical outcomes can be achieved with either microfracture or HA-BMAC. Cartilage repair using HA-BMAC leads to successful medium-term outcomes independent of age or lesion size.",1

This third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) technique improves on the limitations of previous methods, including the risk of uneven chondrocyte distribution at the time of implantation and graft hypertrophy. Given the compliant properties of the scaffold, the graft can be easily shaped to treat irregular chondral defects and applied to articular surfaces with multiplanar geometry (e.g., patella, trochlea). Although ACI techniques are ideally suited to treat chondral surface defects, the ACI ""sandwich"" technique can be used to treat large osteochondral defects with significant bone loss (>8 mm). Historically, this procedure uses autologous bone graft to replace areas of osseous deficiency along with 2 type I/III collagen bilayer membranes to securely contain the cultured chondrocytes within the defect. We present an analogous technique for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the femoral trochlea using a single matrix-induced ACI scaffold and autologous bone grafting for a segmental osseous defect.",0

In most cases, the aetiology is not well understood, but fortunately, many OCD lesions may heal on their own over time, particularly in skeletally immature patients with open physes. Conversely, if the lesion is considered unstable, surgical intervention may be required. This case demonstrates an especially rare presentation of bilateral OCD lesions within the lateral femoral trochlear facet. The lesions became symptomatic approximately 1 year apart without a specific injury. Non-operative treatment was not recommended in either case due to the size and instability of each lesion. The surgical treatment used an augmented microfracture technique. At 12 and 23 months after surgery, both knees remain asymptomatic and the patient has returned to their desired activities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0020-1383(13)70004-4,Treatment of cartilage lesions: What works and why?,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Cartilage injuries have a high incidence and a high impact on society. In an attempt to fulfill patients' expectations and successfully treat this pathology, various techniques have been developed over the years. Treatments proposed for cartilage lesions are described with their rationale and indications, ranging from conservative measures to surgical approaches, reparative or regenerative. Among the numerous and heterogeneous procedures proposed over time to treat cartilage defects none has clearly proven to lead to a hyaline articular surface nor to offer better clinical results. Regenerative procedures have been introduced as ambitious techniques that aim to overcome the limitations of the more traditional reparative approaches and restore the articular surface with a hyaline-like tissue; improvement in tissue engineering with new scaffolds as well as new regenerative options involving growth factors or MSCs are currently being investigated as promising solutions to further improve the treatment of cartilage lesions. However, the current literature findings are not conclusive. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate new regenerative approaches, to show clearly advantages and disadvantages with respect to the more traditional procedures, besides their potential, limits, and indications to improve the treatment of patients affected by chondral and osteochondral lesions. Since clear and commonly accepted treatment algorithms are not available in the literature, the massively increasing number of controversial results may be confusing for the orthopaedic surgeon who has to choose the proper management of patients with cartilage lesions. Thus, the results obtained through the study of the authors' 20 years' experience in cartilage treatment were analyzed to give some indications on the potential and limits of different treatment approaches available in clinical practice.",0

Incidences sur la rééducation,"Le but de cette étude est de faire le point sur les techniques, les indications et la prise en charge des trois principales méthodes de réparation des lésions cartilagineuses du genou. Ont été exclus le lavage arthroscopique et le débridement. Les articles les plus importants des 20 dernières années ont été étudiés en privilégiant ceux écrits par les promoteurs des techniques et ceux apportant des résultats avec le plus de recul. Chaque technique, les microfractures, les greffes ostéochondrales et la greffe de chondrocytes, sera développée avec ses principes chirurgicaux, sa prise en charge rééducative spécifique et ses résultats. Le protocole postopératoire sera peu spécifique dans les premières semaines : pour les lésions condyliennes, la protection de la zone de greffe est indispensable par un non-appui strict mais la mobilisation du genou est possible d’emblée ; pour les lésions rotuliennes, l’appui est autorisé mais la flexion est limitée. Ensuite, les délais de reprise d’appui, de renforcement musculaire, de reprise des sports sont spécifiques de chaque technique. Ces trois techniques ne s’appliquent qu’à des lésions symptomatiques des condyles en zone d’appui ou de la fémoro-patellaire chez des sujets jeunes ; l’arthrose même débutante est exclue. Ces lésions peuvent être associées à une rupture du ligament croisé antérieur et la réparation cartilagineuse d’emblée sera discutée. The objective of the present study is to assess the techniques, indications and management of the three principal repair methods of cartilaginous lesions of the knee. Arthroscopic irrigation and debridement are excluded. The most important articles of the last 20 years have been evaluated favouring those written by the protagonists of the technique and those with the longest follow-up. Each technique, i.e. the microfractures, the osteochondral grafts and the chondrocyte grafts, is explained in detail with its surgical principles, management of specific reeducation and results. Postoperative treatment is not very different during the first weeks ; for condyle lesions protection of the graft site is mandatory by strict avoidance of non weight bearing, whereas immediat mobilisation of the knee is possible; for patellar lesions, weight bearing is permitted whereas flexion is limited. Later, the delay concerning resumption of weight bearing, muscular training and sports is specific for each technique. These three techniques are only apply to symptomatic lesions of the condyle at the weight-hearing zone or the femoro-patellar site in young patients. The degenerative knee, even in its beginning, is excluded. Those lesions can be linked to rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament and immediate cartilaginous repair is discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2007.08.017,A Novel Cell Delivery System Using Magnetically Labeled Mesenchymal Stem Cells and an External Magnetic Device for Clinical Cartilage Repair,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to successfully accumulate magnetically labeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), under the direction of an external magnetic force, to the desired portion of osteochondral defects of the patellae after intra-articular injection of the MSCs.MSCs were cultured from bone marrow and were labeled magnetically. Osteochondral defects were made in the center of rabbit and swine patellae, and magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the knee joints either under the direction of an external magnetic force or with no magnetic force applied. In the rabbit model we evaluated the patellae macroscopically and histologically, and in the swine model we observed the patellae arthroscopically.Accumulation of magnetically labeled MSCs to the osteochondral defect was shown macroscopically and histologically in the rabbit model and was shown by arthroscopic observation to be attached to the chondral defect in the swine model.We showed the ability to deliver magnetically labeled MSCs to a desired place in the knee joint.Our novel approach is applicable for human cartilage defects and may open a new era of repairing cartilage defects caused by osteoarthritis or trauma by use of a less invasive technique.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-010-1271-5,We do not have evidence based methods for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee,"The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of studies concerning current treatment of chondral defects of the knee.The relevance for evidence based data and for successful surgical treatment of cartilage defects was evaluated. From 56,098 evaluated studies, 133 studies could be further pursued. These supplied data concerning microfracturing, the osteochondral autograft transplantation system (OATS), the autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and the matrix induced chondrocyte implantation (MACI). The modified Coleman Methodical Score (CMS) and the Level of Evidence (LOE) were applied to evaluate the quality.In these studies, a total of 6,920 patients were reviewed with a median of 32 patients per study and a mean follow-up of 24 months. The mean CMS was 58 of 100 points. No study reached 100 points in the CMS. Three studies reached a level above 90. Ten studies were Level I, five studies reached Level II. Seven studies reached Level III, 111 studies Level IV. MRI scans to verify the clinical data were used by only 72 studies. The means in the modified CMS were for the different procedures as follows: ACI 58 points, MACI 57 points, microfracturing 68 points and OATS 50 points. 24 studies applied the Lysholm Score (LS) for clinical evaluation of cartilage surgery. All operative procedures yielded comparable improvements of the LS (n.s.) meaning that no operative procedure proved superior.As the majority of studies evaluated by this review is insufficient for EBM purposes more coherent studies with LOE of I or II are needed. Co-relating the systems of CMS and LOE and validating the applied scores seems desirable.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546511424396,The Incidence and Clinical Relevance of Graft Hypertrophy After Matrix-Based Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation,"Background: Graft hypertrophy is the most common complication of periosteal autologous chondrocyte implantation (p-ACI). Purpose: The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the development, the incidence rate, and the persistence of graft hypertrophy after matrix-based autologous chondrocyte implantation (mb-ACI) in the knee joint within a 2-year postoperative course. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between 2004 and 2007, a total of 41 patients with 44 isolated cartilage defects of the knee were treated with the mb-ACI technique. The mean age of the patients was 35.8 years (standard deviation [SD], 11.3 years), and the mean body mass index was 25.9 (SD, 4.2; range, 19-35.3). The cartilage defects were arthroscopically classified as Outerbridge grades III and IV. The mean area of the cartilage defect measured 6.14 cm 2 (SD, 2.3 cm 2 ). Postoperative clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were conducted at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to analyze the incidence and course of the graft. Results: Graft hypertrophy developed in 25% of the patients treated with mb-ACI within a postoperative course of 1 year; 16% of the patients developed hypertrophy grade 2, and 9% developed hypertrophy grade 1. Graft hypertrophy occurred primarily in the first 12 months and regressed in most cases within 2 years. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores improved during the postoperative follow-up time of 2 years. There was no difference between the clinical results regarding the IKDC and VAS pain scores and the presence of graft hypertrophy. Conclusion: The mb-ACI technique does not lead to graft hypertrophy requiring treatment as opposed to classic p-ACI. The frequency of occurrence of graft hypertrophy after p-ACI and mb-ACI is comparable. Graft hypertrophy can be considered as a temporary excessive growth of regenerative cartilage tissue rather than a true graft hypertrophy. It is therefore usually not a persistent or systematic complication in the treatment of circumscribed cartilage defects with mb-ACI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.32613,Artificial cartilage made from a novel double-network hydrogel:<i>In vivo</i>effects on the normal cartilage and<i>ex vivo</i>evaluation of the friction property,"This study evaluated the in vivo influence of a poly-(2-Acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid)/poly-(N,N'-dimetyl acrylamide) (PAMPS/PDMAAm) double-network (DN) hydrogel on counterface cartilage in rabbit knee joints and its ex vivo friction properties on normal cartilage. In the first experiment, the DN gel was implanted in a surgically created defect in the femoral trochlea of rabbit knee joints and the left knee was used as the control. Evaluations using a confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that the DN gel did not affect the surface microstructure (surface roughness, the number of small pits) of the counterface cartilage in vivo at 4 and 12 weeks. The histology also showed that the DN gel hadno pathological damage on the cartilage matrices and cells at 4 weeks. However, two of the five DN gel-implanted knees showed mild irregularity on the counterface cartilage surface at 12 weeks. In the second experiment, the friction property between the normal and the artificial cartilage was determined using a joint simulator apparatus. The ex vivo mean friction coefficient of the DN gel to normal cartilage was 0.029, while that of the normal-to-normal cartilage articulation was 0.188. The coefficient of the DN gel-to-normal cartilage articulation was significantly lower than that of the normal-to-normal cartilage articulation (p < 0.0001). This study suggested that the PAMPS/PDMAAm DN gel has very low friction coefficient on normal cartilage and has no significant detrimental effects on counterface cartilage in vivo, and can be a promising material to develop the artificial cartilage.",0
https://doi.org/10.22203/ecm.v036a16,Mesenchymal stem cell secretome reduces pain and prevents cartilage damage in a murine osteoarthritis model,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising biological therapeutic option as an osteoarthritis (OA)-modifying treatment. MSCs secrete factors that can counteract inflammatory and catabolic processes and attract endogenous repair cells. The effects of intra-articular injection of MSC secretome on OA-related pain, cartilage damage, subchondral bone alterations and synovial inflammation were studied in a mouse collagenase-induced OA model. The MSC secretome was generated by stimulating human bone-marrow-derived MSCs with interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). 54 mice were randomly assigned to injections with i) MSC secretome from 20,000 MSCs, ii) 20,000 MSCs or iii) medium (control). Pain was assessed by hind limb weight distribution. Cartilage damage, subchondral bone volume and synovial inflammation were evaluated by histology. MSC-secretome- and MSC-injected mice showed pain reduction at day 7 when compared to control mice. Cartilage damage was more abundant in the control group as compared to healthy knees, a difference which was not found in knees treated with MSC secretome or MSCs. No effects were observed regarding synovial inflammation, subchondral bone volume or the presence of different macrophage subtypes. Injection of MSC secretome, similarly to injection of MSCs, resulted in early pain reduction and had a protective effect on the development of cartilage damage in a murine OA model. By using the regenerative capacities of the MSC-secreted factors, it will be possible to greatly enhance the standardisation, affordability and clinical translatability of the approach. This way, this biological therapy could evolve towards a true disease-modifying anti-osteoarthritic drug.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546514530292,Treatment of Large Knee Osteochondral Lesions With a Biomimetic Scaffold,"Background: Osteochondral knee lesions represent a challenging condition encountered by orthopaedic surgeons. A variety of methods have been developed to repair articular cartilage defects. However, these techniques are limited by donor site morbidity or by the requirement for a staged procedure. Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of a biomimetic osteochondral scaffold for the treatment of large osteochondral knee lesions. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: From 2009 to 2011, a total of 49 patients affected by isolated large osteochondral knee lesions (mean [± SD] size, 4.35 ± 1.26 cm 2 ) were treated with the biomimetic scaffold. Patients were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) up to 3-year follow-up. The MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score was performed to analyze different variables. Biopsies were carried out in 5 patients. Four of the 5 second-look arthroscopies and biopsies were performed on patients with failed results because of ethical issues. Results: The mean IKDC subjective score increased significantly from 45.45 ± 19.29 preoperatively to 70.86 ± 18.08 at 1-year follow-up and to 75.42 ± 19.31 at 2-year follow-up ( P &lt; .001). The IKDC objective score changed from 50% normal and nearly normal knees before treatment to 89.79% at the 2-year follow-up. There was a statistically significant improvement ( P &lt; .005) in VAS score from the preoperative level (6.69 ± 1.88) to the 2-year follow-up (1.96 ± 2.47). Tegner scores increased ( P &lt; .001) from the preoperative value (2.20 ± 0.67) to the 2-year follow-up (4.9 ± 1.73) without achieving preinjury level. A correlation was found between the IKDC subjective score and age ( P &lt; .001, r = −0.497, ρ = −0.502). Patients affected by osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) achieved a statistically significantly better outcome ( P &lt; .05). A subgroup of 19 competitive athletes showed a statistically significantly improvement ( P &lt; .001) in the subjective IKDC (86.5 ± 13.2) compared with the nonathletic subpopulation (69.03 ± 19.41) at the 2-year follow-up. The MRI findings of 30 patients were available at 2-year follow-up: 70% showed complete filling of the lesion, 63.3% had an intact articular surface, and 86% had mild or no effusion. In all cases, in dual T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence, the repair tissue showed a hyperintensive signal with respect to the surrounding subchondral bone; however, no edema was observed. Conclusion: The study findings indicate that the biomimetic scaffold that was investigated is an off-the-shelf, cell-free, and cost-effective implant that can regenerate either cartilage or subchondral bone. The scaffold allows a 1-step surgical procedure that can be used for osteochondral lesions, OCD, and in some cases osteonecrosis.",0
,Autologous chondrocyte transplantation for reconstruction of isolated joint defects: the Assaf Harofeh experience.,"Articular cartilage is incapable of undergoing self-repair since chondrocytes lose their mitotic ability as early as the first year of life. Defects in articular cartilage, especially in weight-bearing joints, will predictably deteriorate toward osteoarthritis. No method has been found to prevent this deterioration. Drilling of the subchondral bone can lead to fibrocartilage formation and temporary repair that slowly degrades. Animal experiments indicate that introducing proliferating chondrocytes such as cultured articular chondrocytes can reliably reconstruct joint defects.To describe our clinical experience in culturing and transplanting autologous chondrocytes.Biopsies were obtained from 10 patients, aged 18-45, undergoing a routine arthroscopy in which a cartilage defect was identified with indications for cartilage transplantation. The biopsies were further processed to establish chondrocyte cultures. ACT was performed in 8 of the 10 patients because of persistent symptoms for at least 2 months post-arthroscopy. All patients (6 men and 2 women) had a grade IV cartilage defect in the medial or lateral femoral condyle, and three had a defect in the trochlear region as well. Biopsies were removed from the lateral rim of the superior aspect of the femur, and cells were cultured in a clean room. Following a 2 order of magnitude expansion, cells were implanted under a periosteal flap.The eight patients implanted with autologous cells were followed for 6 months to 5 years (average 1 year). Complaints of giving-way, effusion and joint locking resolved in all patients, and pain as assessed by the visual analogue score was reduced by an average of 50%. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging studies in all patients revealed that the defects were filled with tissue having similar signal characteristics to cartilage.Chondrocyte implantation is a procedure capable of restoring normal articular cartilage in cases with isolated joint defects. Pain can be predictably reduced, while joint locking and effusion are eliminated. The effect on osteoarthritis progression in humans has not yet been elucidated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04727-2,Autologous chondrocytes versus filtered bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells for knee cartilage repair—a prospective study,"Purpose To document clinical, radiologic, and cellular data of a prospective patient series treated by a tri-layer collagen-hydroxyapatite biomimetic osteochondral scaffold (CHAS) intra-operatively seeded with cultivated autologous chondrocytes (AC) or with filtered bone marrow stem/stromal cells (fBMSC) to address chronic osteochondral knee lesions. Methods Thirty-six consecutive patients (15 to 59 years) with chronic osteochondral lesions (1.8-10 cm(2)) in the condylar or patellofemoral knee surfaces were enrolled. Lesions were covered with CHAS fixed with a fibrin glue. The superficial layer of CHAS was intra-operatively injected with active cells: in initial five patients, ACs were put directly onto dry CHAS (dry-AC); next, eight AC patients had CHAS moistened with cell culture media (media-AC), while the tourniquet was released allowing blood soaking of CHAS in the rest (14 blood-AC, 9 blood-fBMSC). Seventeen (50%) patients required different concomitant procedures. All patients were followed for serious adverse events (SAE) or graft failures; clinical, radiographic, and MRI evaluation was conducted. Cellular data on the injected cells were assessed. Results At a follow-up of 39 months (16-81), 17 patients required an additional surgical intervention: seven graft-related SAE (early post-operative synovitis and/or arthrofibrosis) were registered (3 dry-AC, 3 media-AC, 1 blood-fBMSC). There were two graft failures (1 dry-AC, 1 blood-fBMSC) for secondary reasons. All clinical scores significantly improved from pre- to post-operative values: IKCD subjective 44 to 65; IKDC examination (9/17/5/5) to (20/10/5/1); KOOS (P61/S59/ADL67/Sp32/QoL31) to (P79/S75/ADL84/Sp55/QoL51); Tegner activity scale 3.3 to 4.4. There was evidence of radiographic osteoarthritis progression-Kellgren-Lawrence 1.0 to 1.5. MOCART scores at the final follow-up averaged 71 (10 to 95). Graft-type analysis demonstrated an increased rate of graft-related SAE in dry-AC and media-AC, but their final outcomes were equivalent. Cellular data of AC at the implantation were as follows: cells in suspension 9.2 x 10(6), viability 95%. In blood-fBMSC group, a cell suspension with 87% viability was injected, which contained 1156 CFU-Fs. Conclusion CHAS with intra-operative seeding of active cells, either AC or fBMSC, led to an overall successful outcome for the treatment of chronic osteochondral lesions in the knee. Blood soaking of CHAS in situ before cell seeding significantly decreased early post-operative adverse events, such as synovitis and arthrofibrosis.",1

Cell viability, proliferation and differentiation capacity were assessed in vitro using appropriate functional assays. Cells underwent GRE T2*-weighted MRI in vitro. The autologous MSCs seeded in chitosan and glycerophosphate (C-GP) gel were injected into the knee joint cavity of rabbit models for cartilage defects. All rabbits underwent GRE T2*-weighted MRI 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-injection. MR imaging findings were compared histologically.Nanoparticles were stained with Prussian blue and observed by transmission electron microscopy inside the cells. Cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation were comparable between labeled and non-labeled cells. After intra-articular injection of labeled autologous MSCs, marked hypointense signal void areas representing the injected MSCs can be observed for at least 12 weeks on GRE T2*-weighted images. At 12 weeks post-injection, labeled MSCs migrated into the synovial fluid at the suprapatellar bursa, the popliteal space site and subchondral bone of the femur but no MSCs were detected in the defect. Histochemical staining confirmed the presence of Prussian blue-positive cells and BrdU-positive cells.MRI would be an efficient noninvasive technique to visually track SPIO-labeled seed cells in vivo; the engineered autologous MSCs do not actively participate in the repair of articular cartilage defects following intra-articular injection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.13130858,Iron Administration before Stem Cell Harvest Enables MR Imaging Tracking after Transplantation,"To determine whether intravenous ferumoxytol can be used to effectively label mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vivo and can be used for tracking of stem cell transplants.This study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Sprague-Dawley rats (6-8 weeks old) were injected with ferumoxytol 48 hours prior to extraction of MSCs from bone marrow. Ferumoxytol uptake by these MSCs was evaluated with fluorescence, confocal, and electron microscopy and compared with results of traditional ex vivo-labeling procedures. The in vivo-labeled cells were subsequently transplanted in osteochondral defects of 14 knees of seven athymic rats and were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging up to 4 weeks after transplantation. T2 relaxation times of in vivo-labeled MSC transplants and unlabeled control transplants were compared by using t tests. MR data were correlated with histopathologic results.In vivo-labeled MSCs demonstrated significantly higher ferumoxytol uptake compared with ex vivo-labeled cells. With electron microscopy, iron oxide nanoparticles were localized in secondary lysosomes. In vivo-labeled cells demonstrated significant T2 shortening effects in vitro and in vivo when they were compared with unlabeled control cells (T2 in vivo, 15.4 vs 24.4 msec; P < .05) and could be tracked in osteochondral defects for 4 weeks. Histologic examination confirmed the presence of iron in labeled transplants and defect remodeling.Intravenous ferumoxytol can be used to effectively label MSCs in vivo and can be used for tracking of stem cell transplants with MR imaging. This method eliminates risks of contamination and biologic alteration of MSCs associated with ex vivo-labeling procedures.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-009-0905-y,Autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee using fibrin,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is widely used to treat symptomatic articular cartilage injury of the knee. Fibrin ACI is a new tissue-engineering technique for the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects, in which autologous chondrocytes are inserted into a three-dimensional scaffold provided by fibrin gel. The objective of this study is to document and compare mean changes in overall clinical scores at both baseline and follow-up. Fibrin ACI was used to treat deep cartilage defects of the femoral condyle in 30 patients. There were 24 men and 6 women with a median age of 35 years (range 15-55) and with a mean defect size of 5.8 cm(2) (range 2.3-12). Clinical and functional knee evaluations were performed using different scoring systems, MRI was performed 24 months postoperatively, and arthroscopy was performed 12 months postoperatively. All patients achieved clinical and functional status improvements following surgery (P \textbackslashtextless 0.01). The mean scores of the Henderson classification (MRI evaluation) significantly improved from 14.4 to 7 (P = 0.001), and no graft-associated complications were noted. Arthroscopic assessments performed 12 months postoperatively produced nearly normal (grade II) International Cartilage Repair Society scores in 8 of the 10 study patients. Fibrin ACI offers the advantages of technical simplicity, minimal invasiveness, a short surgery time, and easier access to difficult sites than classical ACI. Based on the findings of this clinical pilot study, we conclude that fibrin ACI offers a reliable means of treating articular cartilage defects of the knee.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-018-4834-5,Hydrogel implant is as effective as osteochondral autologous transplantation for treating focal cartilage knee injury in 24 months,"Purpose The treatment approach for a patient with knee joint focal cartilage lesion is a difficult decision. To date, there has been no randomized clinical trial involving Hydrogel (Cartiva (TM)). This study evaluated and compared the results of a hydrogel implant (Cartiva (TM)) with autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) for treating knee joint focal cartilage lesions. Methods Thirty-eight symptomatic patients, with a focal cartilage lesion of Outerbridge grades III or IV, were randomized into one of two groups according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Group I underwent AOT, and Group II was treated with a Hydrogel implant. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and again postoperatively at 6, 12, and 24 months using the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS) and Lysholm score. Results Both groups showed significant improvements from baseline (pre-surgery) to post-surgery (6, 12, and 24 months; p \textbackslashtextless 0.05), but there was no difference between the groups. Regarding complications, prolonged pain was observed in four patients (10.5%), two from each group, with a regression of symptoms within 1 year. Conclusion The Hydrogel implant showed similar efficiency as the autologous osteochondral graft for treating knee joint focal cartilage lesions. Both techniques showed satisfactory results compared to preoperative status. The Hydrogel implant was safe and effective, and it provided good stability and joint function at 2-year follow-up.",1

This prospective study evaluated our clinical results for cartilage repair in five patients with chondral defects localized at the humeral head using a combination of microfracture and periostal flap, all by deltoidopectoral approach. Mean follow-up was 25.8 months (range 24-31) and consisted of a clinical examination, Constant score examination, radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging; three patients underwent a second-look arthroscopy an average of 8 months following cartilage repair. We found the Constant score significantly improved over the preoperative level, from 43.4% to 81.8%. Pain was reduced significantly to 18.6 points. Radiography and magnetic resonance imaging showed progression of the osteoarthritis in two patients. Second-look arthroscopy revealed a significantly reduced cartilage lesion. This is the first report of a combination of microfracture and a periostal flap for repair of focal full-thickness cartilage lesions at the shoulder. Short-term follow-up clinical results were satisfactory. It is essential to address the underlying pathology. Results must be reconfirmed in a long-term study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2009.11.014,A novel nano-composite multi-layered biomaterial for treatment of osteochondral lesions: Technique note and an early stability pilot clinical trial,"Osteochondral articular defects are a key concern in orthopaedic surgery. Current surgical techniques to repair osteochondral defects lead to poor subchondral bone regeneration and fibrocartilage formation, which is often associated with joint pain and stiffness. The objective of this pilot clinical study is to evaluate the performance and the intrinsic stability of a newly developed biomimetic osteochondral scaffold and to test the safety and the feasibility of the surgical procedure.A gradient composite osteochondral scaffold based on type I collagen-hydroxyapatite was obtained by nucleating collagen fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. Thirteen patients (15 defect sites) were treated with scaffold implantation from January 2007 to July 2007: four at the medial femoral condyle, two at the lateral femoral condyles, five at the patellas and four at the trochleas. The mean size of the defects was 2.8 cm(2) (range: 1.5-5.9 cm(2)). All patients were followed up prospectively. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine ""the early postoperative adherence rate"" at 4-5 weeks and 25-26 weeks after scaffold implantation. Moreover, the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was performed on every MRI. Two second-looks were performed at 6 months; cartilage repair was assessed using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual scoring system and histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the two biopsies was carried out.A completely attached graft and repair tissue were found in 13 of 15 lesions (86.7%). A partial detachment was observed in two patients (13.3%). No detached grafts were found. Complete filling of the cartilage defect and congruency of the articular surface were seen in 10 lesions (66.7%) with MRI evaluation at 6 months. The complete integration of the grafted cartilage was detected in eight lesions (53.3%). Subchondral bone changes (oedema or sclerosis) were found in eight defects (53.3%). Statistical analysis showed a significant improvement in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores from preoperative to 6 months' follow-up (p<0.0005). Visual scoring of the repaired tissue at second-look revealed a normal repair score in one case and a near-normal repair score in the other case. Histological analysis showed the formation of subchondral bone without the presence of biomaterial. The cartilage repair tissue appeared to be engaged in an ongoing maturation process.The technique is safe and MRI evaluation at short-term follow-up has demonstrated good stability of the scaffold without any other fixation device. The preliminary clinical results at short-term follow-up are encouraging. A clinical and MRI study with longer follow-up and randomised studies will be done to confirm the high potential of this novel osteochondral scaffold.",0

Associated Factors, Operative Options, and Preliminary Results from the CartilageRegistry DGOU","Zusammenfassung Degenerativ bedingte Knorpelschäden im medialen Kniekompartiment. Assoziierte Faktoren, operative Optionen und präliminäre Ergebnisse. Ergebnisse aus dem KnorpelRegister (DGOU). Zielsetzung Ziel dieser Untersuchung war es, den Stellenwert der knorpelregenerativen Behandlungen bei Patienten mit degenerativ bedingten Knorpelschäden des Kniegelenkes, vor allem bei Vorliegen von kombinierten Defekten, unter dem Aspekt der Versorgungsforschung anhand der Daten aus dem KnorpelRegister in Deutschland zu untersuchen. Material und Methode Das KnorpelRegister (DGOU) besteht seit dem Jahre 2013. Bis August 2016 wurden im Kniemodul des Registers insgesamt 1847 Behandlungsfälle erfasst, von denen 432 Patienten (23,3%) degenerativ bedingte Knorpelschäden im Bereich des medialen Kompartiments aufwiesen. Entsprechend den Präferenzen der verschiedenen an der Erfassung beteiligten Einrichtungen wurden bei diesen Patienten verschiedene Verfahren der knorpelregenerativen Therapie angewandt. Die Kontrolluntersuchungen ([Online-]Evaluation) erfolgte nach 6, 12 und 24 Monaten durch Befragung der subjektiven Patientenzufriedenheit und Bestimmung des KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score). Ergebnisse Insgesamt hatten 358 Patienten isolierte Defekte im Bereich des medialen Kondylus, 25 Patienten isolierte tibiale Defekte und bei den restlichen 49 Patienten lagen kombinierte Defekte (kissing lesions) vor. Unterschiede zwischen Männern und Frauen in Bezug auf die Defektpathologie gab es nicht, Patienten mit isolierten femoralen bzw. tibialen Defekten waren signifikant jünger als Patienten mit kombinierten Defekten. Tendenziell hatten Patienten mit einem tibialen Defekt eine kürzere Anamnesedauer. Als Therapie kam in 20,1% der Fälle die Knochenmarkstimulation, in 39,9% die autologe Knorpeltransplantation allein bzw. in 8,1% der Fälle die Knorpeltransplantation in Kombination mit einer Spongiosaplastik zur Anwendung. Sonstige Therapieverfahren waren Bohrung, osteochondrale Transplantationen, matrixassoziierte Mikrofrakturierung, Débridement. In 17,9% der Fälle erfolgten kombinierte Verfahren. Begleiteingriffe wurden bei 39,7% der Patienten mit einem isolierten femoralen, bei 56,0% der Patienten mit einem tibialen und in 67,6% bei kombinierten Defekten durchgeführt. Hierbei handelte es sich in den meisten Fällen um zusätzliche Tibiakopfosteotomien. Subjektiv waren Patienten mit einem femoralen Defekt signifikant häufiger sehr zufrieden/zufrieden, gefolgt von Patienten mit isoliertem Tibiadefekt. Am schlechtesten schlossen Patienten mit kombinierten Defekten ab. Der KOOS betrug zur Eingangsuntersuchung im Median 52 Punkte und stieg nach 6 Monaten auf 75, nach 12 Monaten auf 78 und nach 24 Monaten auf 80 Punkte an. Dabei zeigten Patienten mit einem isolierten femoralen Defekt tendenziell bessere Ergebnisse als die übrigen Patienten. Die Gesamtrevisionsrate betrug 7,1%.

Autologous chondrocyte implantation using a characterized cell therapy product results in significantly better early structural repair as compared with microfracture in patients with symptomatic joint surface defects of the femoral condyles of the knee. Purpose To evaluate clinical outcome at 36 months after characterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI) versus microfracture (MF). Study Design Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods Patients aged 18 to 50 years with single International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III/IV symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyles were randomized to CCI (n = 57) or MF (n = 61). Clinical outcome was measured over 36 months by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were scored using the Magnetic resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) system and 9 additional items. Gene expression profile scores associated with ectopic cartilage formation were determined by RT-PCR. Results Baseline mean overall KOOS (±SE) was comparable between the CCI and MF groups (56.30 ± 1.91 vs 59.46 ± 1.98, respectively). Mean improvement (±SE) from baseline to 36 months in overall KOOS was greater in the CCI group than the MF group (21.25 ± 3.60 vs 15.83 ± 3.48, respectively), while in a mixed linear model analysis with time as a categorical variable, significant differences favoring CCI were shown in overall KOOS (P = .048) and the subdomains of Pain (P = .044) and QoL (P = .036). More CCI- than MF-treated patients were treatment responders (83% vs 62%, respectively). In patients with symptom onset of &lt;2 years, the mean improvement (±SE) from baseline to 36 months in overall KOOS was greater with CCI than MF (24.98 ± 4.34 vs 16.50 ± 3.99, respectively) and even greater in patients with symptom onset of &lt;3 years (26.08 ± 4.10 vs 17.09 ± 3.77, respectively). Characterized chondrocyte implantation patients with high (&gt;2) versus low (&lt;2) gene profile scores showed greater improvement from baseline in mean overall KOOS (±SE) at 36 months (28.91 ± 5.69 vs 18.18 ± 5.08, respectively). Subchondral bone reaction significantly worsened over time with MF compared with CCI (P &lt; .05). Conclusion Characterized chondrocyte implantation for the treatment of articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyles of the knee results in significantly better clinical outcome at 36 months in a randomized trial compared with MF. Time to treatment and chondrocyte quality were shown to affect outcome.",1

So far, satisfactory solution to this subsistent problem has not been found, but transgenic therapy may be a promising way. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a tissue-engineered cartilage that was transfected with morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP 7) in repairing the cartilaginous defects of rabbit knee joints. Chondrocytes were transfected with BMP-7 gene (5 x 10(6) cells/ml), inoculated into the collagen-fibrin gel scaffolds, and cultured for 14 days. Then, the scaffolds were implanted onto the created defects (5.0 mm in diameter) in rabbits' knee joints. After 12 weeks, the rabbits were sacrificed and histological sections were evaluated using modified O'Driscoll cartilage scores; In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect the expression of BMP-7 mRNA and BMP-7 at the implanted site while the content of DNA and GAG was determined as well. A better quality of repairs was observed at the 12th week after implantation when compared to the control group using histological analyses. The content of DNA and specific secretion of GAG in the treatment group is statistically significant different compared with the control group. Gene therapy may be a promising treatment method, but the novel therapy approach needs further studies with respect to a longer follow-up period.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222413323,Method Categorization of Stem Cell Therapy for Degenerative Osteoarthritis of the Knee: A Review,"Current clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis lack consistency because there are no established criteria for clinical processes. We aimed to systematically organize stem cell treatment methods by reviewing the literature. The treatment methods used in 27 clinical trials were examined and reviewed. The clinical processes were separated into seven categories: cell donor, cell source, cell preparation, delivery methods, lesion preparation, concomitant procedures, and evaluation. Stem cell donors were sub-classified as autologous and allogeneic, and stem cell sources included bone marrow, adipose tissue, peripheral blood, synovium, placenta, and umbilical cord. Mesenchymal stem cells can be prepared by the expansion or isolation process and attached directly to cartilage defects using matrices or injected into joints under arthroscopic observation. The lesion preparation category can be divided into three subcategories: chondroplasty, microfracture, and subchondral drilling. The concomitant procedure category describes adjuvant surgery, such as high tibial osteotomy. Classification codes were assigned for each subcategory to provide a useful and convenient method for organizing documents associated with stem cell treatment. This classification system will help researchers choose more unified treatment methods, which will facilitate the efficient comparison and verification of future clinical outcomes of stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis.",0

Full-thickness chondral defects ≥2 cm2 were filled with chitosan-based implant after microfractures. Follow-up consisted of alpha angle assessment and clinical outcome in the form of the Non Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), International Hip Outcome Tool 33 (iHOT33), Hip Outcome Score of Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), and Hip Outcome Score of Sports Specific Scale (HOS-SSS).Twenty-three patients were included. The mean follow-up was 38.4 ± 7.0 months (range, 24-50 months). The mean defect size was 3.5 ± 1.0 cm2, principally involving zone 2 and to a lesser extent in zones 1 and 3. Using femoroplasty, the alpha angle was corrected from a mean 70.5 ± 6.3° to 44.3 ± 4.9° (P = .00001). Significant improvement occurred comparing the preoperative to the first-year postoperative patient-reported outcomes: P = .00001 for the NAHS, P = .00004 for the iHOT33, P = .00005 for the HOS-ADL, and P = .0002 for the HOS-SSS. No statistically significant change has been observed in the patient-reported outcomes obtained at the endpoint when compared with the first-year values (P = .13 for the NAHS, P = .21 for the HOS-ADL, and P = .29 for the HOS-SSS), except for the iHOT33, which showed further significant improvement (P = .02). Up to 91% of the patients met or exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. One patient needed total hip arthroplasty. Perineal hypoesthesia occurred in 3 patients, who recovered within 2 to 6 weeks, and 1 patient needed a prolonged physiotherapy program for postoperative muscular stiffness.The arthroscopic combined treatment of microfractures and chitosan-based scaffold has maintained satisfactory clinical outcomes in 91% of the patients with s large (≥2 cm2) full-thickness acetabular chondral defect associated with femoroacetabular impingement at a mean follow-up of 38.4 months. The study could not definitely draw any conclusion regarding the safety of chitosan-based material for use in the hip joint.Level IV, case series.",0

Therefore, wide-ranging cartilage damage rarely resolves spontaneously. Cartilage damage is typically treated by chondrocyte transplantation, mosaicplasty or microfracture. Recent advances in tissue engineering have prompted research on techniques to repair articular cartilage damage using a variety of transplanted cells. We studied the repair and regeneration of cartilage damage using layered chondrocyte sheets prepared on a temperature-responsive culture dish. We previously reported achieving robust tissue repair when covering only the surface layer with layered chondrocyte sheets when researching partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage of domestic rabbits. The present study was an experiment on the repair and regeneration of articular cartilage in a minipig model of full-thickness defects. Good safranin-O staining and integration with surrounding tissues was achieved in animals transplanted with layered chondrocyte sheets. However, tissue having poor safranin-O staining-not noted in the domestic rabbit experiments-was identified in some of the animals, and the subchondral bone was poorly repaired in these. Thus, although layered chondrocyte sheets facilitate articular cartilage repair, further investigations into appropriate animal models and culture and transplant conditions are required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.b.31571,<i>In vivo</i>outcomes of tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts,"Tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts have been synthesized from a variety of materials, with some success at repairing chondral defects in animal models. We hypothesized that in tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts synthesized by bonding mesenchymal stem cell-loaded hydrogels to a porous material, the choice of the porous scaffold would affect graft healing to host bone, and the quality of cell restoration at the hyaline cartilage surface. Bone marrow-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells were suspended in hydrogels that were attached to cylinders of porous tantalum metal, allograft bone, or a bioactive glass. The tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts, thus created were implanted into experimental defects in rabbit knees. Subchondral bone restoration, defect fill, bone ingrowth-implant integration, and articular tissue quality were compared between the three subchondral materials at 6 and 12 weeks. Bioactive glass and porous tantalum were superior to bone allograft in integrating to adjacent host bone, regenerating hyaline-like tissue at the graft surface, and expressing type II collagen in the articular cartilage. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Thirteen patients were recruited (10 male, 3 female) with a total number of 15 chondral lesions. Each patient underwent an MACI procedure and MR arthrography 30 and 60 months after surgery. MR arthrography was performed using a dedicated coil with a 1.5-Tesla unit. The status of the chondral implant was evaluated with the modified MOCART scoring scale. The lining of the implant, the integration to the border zone, the surface and structure of the repaired tissue were assessed, and the presence of bone marrow oedema and effusion was evaluated. For clinical assessment, the Cincinnati score was used. At 60 months, the abnormality showed worsening in 1 out of 15 cases. Integration showed improvement in 3 out of 15 cases, and worsening in 3 out of 15 cases. Two surfaces of the implant showed further deterioration at 60 months, and 1 afflicted implant fully recovered after the same time interval. Implant contrast enhancement at 30 months was seen in 2 out of 15 cases, 1 of which recovered at 60 months. According to the MOCART score, 4 cases were rated 68.4 out of 75 at 30 months and 65 out of 75 at 60 months. The mean clinical score decreased from 8.6 out of 10 at 30 months to 8.1 out of 10 at 60 months. Magnetic resonance arthrography improved the evaluation of implants and facilitated the characterisation of MACI integration with contiguous tissues. The follow-up showed significant changes in MACI, even at 60 months, allowing for useful long-term MR evaluations.",0
https://doi.org/10.3810/psm.2011.11.1940,Evaluation and Management of Osteochondral Lesions of the Knee,"Osteochondral lesions of the knee is a common disorder in adolescents, although it may present in children and adults. Despite the fact that the disorder was discovered more than a century ago, no specific causes have been identified, although relationships with ischemia, irregular ossification of epiphyseal cartilage, genetic influences, trauma, and endocrine disorders have been postulated. Taking a thorough history and performing a thorough physical examination will facilitate diagnosis of this condition. Radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging are useful diagnostic tools that aid in the evaluation. A comprehensive knowledge of the relevant anatomy and clinical progression of osteochondral lesions allows for a better understanding of the classification systems and, ultimately management of this disorder. The size, location, and stability of the lesion, as well as the patient's age, are crucial in determining optimal treatment. The spectrum of injury ranges from small, stable lesions, which can be treated nonoperatively, to unstable or displaced lesions, which may require surgical management. Surgical options include drilling of subchondral bone, curettage and microfracture, refixation of detached lesions, autologous osteochondral autograft procedures (eg, mosaicplasty, osteochondral autograft transfer system), autologous chondrocyte implantation, and osteochondral allograft resurfacing. This article provides a basic approach to the evaluation and management of osteochondral lesions, as well as indications for surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-019-05739-1,Cartilage damage at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is associated with weaker quadriceps function and lower risk of future ACL injury,"Purpose To determine whether articular cartilage damage noted at the time of primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) affects the likelihood of achieving \textbackslashtextgreater= 90% symmetry for isokinetic extension strength at 6 months after surgery or risk of recurrent ACL injury. Methods Five hundred and eight patients underwent primary ACLR and diagnostic arthroscopy. All identified cartilage lesions were graded using the Outerbridge system. All patients underwent isokinetic strength testing. The association between cartilage Outerbridge grade and a \textbackslashtextgreater= 90% Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) and recurrent ACL injury risk at mean 38.7 month follow-up (SD 31.8) was evaluated via multivariate regression analysis. Results Grade 2 or higher damage was present in 394 (77.5%) of patients, grade 3 or higher in 143 (28.1%) and grade 4 in 83 (16.4%) at time of ACLR. Ipsilateral ACLR graft rupture occurred in 31 (6.1%) of patients. Contralateral ACL injury occurred in 19 (3.7%). Patients with grade 2 or higher damage were significantly less likely to meet an LSI goal of \textbackslashtextgreater= 90% for fast (300 degrees/s) isokinetic extension. There was no association with slow isokinetic extension. Cartilage lesion severity at or beyond grade 2 had a similar effect on isokinetic testing results regardless of compartment involvement or performance of microfracture. Patients with grade 2-4 cartilage damage were less likely to sustain a second ipsilateral ACL injury or a contralateral native ACL injury. Conclusions Cartilage damage seen at time of ACL reconstruction is common and associated with lower likelihood of achieving \textbackslashtextgreater= 90% symmetry for isokinetic extension strength at 6 months after surgery. However, lower recurrent ACL injury rates are seen in patients with concurrent cartilage damage. These data may inform future clinical decisions regarding operative managment of recurrent ACL injuries.",0

The aim of the present study was to assess medium-term results of a one-step procedure using a cell-free collagen type I matrix. Fifteen patients with articular cartilage defects of the knee were treated with an 11-mm-diameter cell-free collagen type 1 matrix implant. The matrices were implanted in a press-fit manner into the defect after careful debridement down to the subchondral bone but without penetration of this margin. Follow-up examinations were carried out at 6 weeks, 6 months, and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after implantation. Clinical assessment included the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Tegner activity scale, and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Radiological assessment for graft attachment and tissue regeneration was performed using the magnetic observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. A total of 15 patients (males: n = 6 and females: n = 9) with a mean age of 26.4 years (range 19-40) were treated. The mean VAS improved significantly when compared to the preoperative values (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). Six weeks after implantation, IKDC values were slightly lower than the preoperative values (n.s.), but increased significantly at final follow-up (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). At 24 months, there were no significant differences in the median Tegner score between the post-operative values and the preoperative values (n.s.). However, after 36 months, a significant improvement was noted that lasted at least up to 48 months (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). The MOCART score improved consistently up to 4 years after implantation, with significant improvements already observed after 12 months (P \textbackslashtextless 0.05). No correlation between the clinical scores and the MOCART score could be perceived. The present study showed that the use of cell-free collagen type I matrix implants led to a significant and durable improvement in all the clinical and imaging scores investigated 4 years after implantation.

https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.rvw.20.00090,Next-Generation Marrow Stimulation Technology for Cartilage Repair,"Given the relatively high prevalence of full-thickness articular cartilage lesions, including in patients who are <40 years of age, and an inability to detect some of these lesions until the time of arthroscopy, there is value in performing a single-stage cartilage procedure such as marrow stimulation (MS).While the positive outcomes of first-generation MS (namely microfracture) have been observed to drop off after 24 months in several studies, improvements have been seen when compared with preoperative conditions for lesions that are 2 to 3 cm2 in size, and MS is considered to be a procedure with technical simplicity, fairly short surgical times, and relatively low morbidity. A recent study showed that autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation remain viable treatment options for chondral defects of the knee in the setting of failed MS.Basic science principles that have been elucidated in recent years include (1) the creation of vertical walls during defect preparation, (2) an increased depth of subchondral penetration, (3) a smaller awl diameter, and (4) an increased number of subchondral perforations, which are all thought to help resolve issues of access to the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and the subchondral bone structure/overgrowth issues.Pioneering and evolving basic science and clinical studies have led to next-generation clinical applications, such as a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold (ongoing randomized controlled trial [RCT]), an atelocollagen-based gel (as described in a recently published RCT), a micronized allogeneic cartilage scaffold (as described in a recently completed prospective cohort study), and a biosynthetic hydrogel that is composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) diacrylate and denatured fibrinogen (as described in an ongoing prospective study).This review summarizes important points for defect preparation and the recent advances in MS techniques and identifies specific scaffolding augmentation strategies (e.g., mesenchymal augmentation and scaffold stimulation [MASS]) that have the capacity to advance cartilage regeneration in light of recent laboratory and clinical studies.",0

Tissue engineering or tissue regeneration is an important method to repair articular cartilage defects. While it has recently been paid much attention to use bilayered porous scaffolds to repair both cartilage and subchondral bone, it is interesting to examine to what extent a bilayer scaffold composed of the same kind of the biodegradable polymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) can restore an osteochondral defect. Herein, we fabricated bilayered PLGA scaffolds and used a rabbit model to examine the efficacy of implanting the porous scaffolds with or without bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The present manuscript reports the regenerative potential up to 24 weeks.The osteochondral defect, 4 mm in diameter and 5 mm in depth, was created in the medial condyle of each knee in 23 rabbits. The bilayered PLGA scaffolds with a pore size of 100-200 μm in the chondral layer and a pore size of 300-450 μm in the osseous layer, seeded with or without BMSCs in the chondral layer, were then transplanted into the osteochondral defect of each knee. The osteochondral defect created in the same manner was untreated to act as the control. At 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively, condyles were harvested and analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and biomechanical testing to evaluate the efficacy of osteochondral repair.No joint erosion, inflammation, swelling, or deformity was observed, and all animals maintained a full range of motion. Compared with the untreated blank group, the groups implanting the bilayered scaffolds with or without cells exhibited much better resurfacing, similar to the surrounding normal tissue. The histological scores of neotissues repaired by the scaffold with cells were closer to that of normal tissue. Although the biomechanical properties of neotissues were not as good as the normal tissue, no significant difference was found between the gene levels of neotissues repaired by the scaffold with or without cells and that of the normal tissue. The repair of the osteochondral defect tends to be stable 12 weeks after implantation.Our bilayered PLGA porous scaffold supports long-term osteochondral repair via in vivo tissue engineering or regeneration, and its effect can be further facilitated under the scaffold seeded with allogenic BMSCs.The bilayered PLGA porous scaffold can facilitate the repair of osteochondral defects and has potential for application in osteochondral tissue engineering.",0

Half of the surgeons indicated that patient age of 50 was the upper limit for cartilage repair. Irrespective of activity level, microfracture (60-67%) was the most frequently used technique for lesions smaller 2.5 cm2. In lesions larger than 4 cm2, MACI was the most commonly advocated procedure (67%). In patients with high activity levels, mosaicplasty was the first choice (69%) for lesions between 2.5 and 4 cm2 in size, followed by MACI (27%).Patient age, activity level, BMI and lesion size were important determinants for the choice of treatment of isolated chondral lesions in the knee. These results reflect the choices of experienced knee surgeons in the country. Although not widely performed in Turkey and has limited reimbursement by the health care system, the first choice for defects over 4 cm2 was second generation ACI. Third party payers & health reimbursement authorities should take into account that large defects require methods which are relatively expensive and need high technology.

A novel blood derivative has been developed to concentrate both growth factors and antagonists of inflammatory cytokines, with promising preliminary findings in terms of safety profile and clinical improvement. Purpose: To investigate if one intra-articular injection of autologous protein solution (APS) can reduce pain and improve function in patients affected by knee OA in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, saline-controlled study. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Forty-six patients with unilateral knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence 2 or 3) were randomized into the APS group (n = 31), which received a single ultrasound-guided injection of APS, and the saline (control) group (n = 15), which received a single saline injection. Patient-reported outcomes and adverse events were collected at 2 weeks and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months through visual analog scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Short Form–36 (SF-36), Clinical Global Impression of Severity/Change (CGI-S/C), Patient Global Impression of Severity/Change (PGI-S/C), and Outcome Measures in Rheumatology–Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) responder rate. Imaging evaluation was also performed with radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after treatment (12 months and 3 and 12 months, respectively). Results: The safety profile was positive, with no significant differences in frequency and severity of adverse events between groups. The improvement from baseline to 2 weeks and to 1, 3, and 6 months was similar between treatments. At 12 months, improvement in WOMAC pain score was 65% in the APS group and 41% in the saline group ( P = .02). There were no significant differences in VAS pain improvement between groups. At 12 months, APS group showed improved SF-36 Bodily Pain subscale ( P = .0085) and Role Emotional Health subscale ( P = .0410), as well as CGI-C values ( P = .01) compared with saline control. Significant differences between groups were detected in change from baseline to 12 months in bone marrow lesion size as assessed on MRI and osteophytes in the central zone of the lateral femoral condyle, both in favor of the APS group ( P = .041 and P = .032, respectively). There were no significant differences between APS and control groups in other measured secondary endpoints. Conclusion: This study provides evidence to support the safety and clinical improvement at 1-year follow-up of a single intra-articular injection of APS in patients affected by knee OA. Treatment with APS or a saline injection provided significant pain relief over the course of the study with differences becoming apparent at between 6 and 12 months after treatment.

https://doi.org/10.1089/107632702753725085,Treatment of Osteochondral Defects with Autologous Bone Marrow in a Hyaluronan-Based Delivery Vehicle,"The natural repair of osteochondral defects can be enhanced with biocompatible, biodegradable and bioactive materials that provide structural support and molecular cuing to stimulate repair. Since bone marrow contains osteochondral progenitor cells and bioactive agents, it is hypothesized that the combination of scaffold and bone marrow would be a superior composite material for osteochondral repair. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the outcome of osteochondral defects filled with a fibronectin-coated hyaluronan-based sponge (ACP) with or without autologous bone marrow. Thirty-three 4-month-old rabbits received 3-mm diameter osteochondral defects that were then filled with ACP loaded or not with autologous bone marrow. Rabbits were sacrificed at 2, 3, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery and the condyles processed for histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The defects were graded with a histologic scoring scale. Except for the 3-week specimens, the histologic appearance of the defects was similar in both groups. Four weeks after surgery, the defects were filled with bone with a top layer of cartilage well integrated with the adjacent cartilage. Twelve and 24 weeks after surgery, the defects again showed bone filling. The primary difference between the 4-week samples and the 12- and 24-week samples was that the layer of cartilage that appeared to be thinner than the adjacent cartilage. At each harvest time, the overall histologic scores of the specimens did not reveal statistical differences between the treatment groups. However, as revealed by the results of the 3-week sacrifices, bone marrow loading appeared to accelerate the first stages of the repair process. The fibronectin-coated hyaluronan-based scaffold appears to organize the natural response and facilitate the integration of the neo-cartilage with the adjacent tissue. The fundamental tissue engineering principles derived from this study should provide guidelines for the development of comparable clinical reconstructive therapies.",0

The present report describes the adverse events following Carticel implantation as reported to the Food and Drug Administration from 1996 to 2003.We reviewed adverse event reports that had been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch system for information on demographic characteristics, adverse events, and surgical revisions. Adverse events were categorized into sixteen non-mutually exclusive groups. Five categories were used to classify reoperations. Food and Drug Administration regulations require manufacturers to report adverse events; however, reporting by clinicians and others is voluntary. Therefore, adverse event reporting is likely to underestimate the number of event occurrences. Adverse events may be either causally or coincidentally related to the product.A total of 497 adverse events among 294 patients receiving Carticel were reported. The median interval from Carticel implantation to the diagnosis of an adverse event was 240 days (range, one to 2105 days). The median age of the patients was thirty-eight years, and 63% of the patients were male. Of the 270 events for which the anatomic site was noted, 258 (96%) involved the femoral condyles. More than one adverse event was reported for 135 patients (46%). The most commonly reported events were graft failure (seventy-three patients; 25%), delamination (sixty-five patients; 22%), and tissue hypertrophy (fifty-two patients; 18%). In addition, eighteen surgical site infections were reported, including eleven joint and seven soft-tissue infections. Surgical revision subsequent to Carticel implantation was mentioned in the records for 273 patients (93%). The reasons for the 389 revision procedures included graft-related problems (187 procedures; 48.1%), periarticular soft-tissue problems (ninety-seven procedures; 24.9%), and intra-articular problems (sixty-three procedures; 16.2%). Eight patients had a total knee replacement. Based on the manufacturer's reported distribution of 7500 Carticel lots between 1995 and 2002, 285 patients (3.8%) had an adverse event that was reported to the Food and Drug Administration.The most common adverse events reported in association with the Carticel technique involved graft failure, delamination, and tissue hypertrophy.",0
